The few things I knowabout economics, I owe to them.A special thanks goes to Prof. Andrea Teglio, Prof. Linda Ponta and Prof. Flavio Tonelliwith whom I had the chance to collaborate during these years in order to realize my researchwork.Obviously, a thought also goes to my parents, Daniela and Rossano, my sister, Elena, andmy love, Federica, for always supporting me.AbstractSince the last 30 years, the economy has been undergoing a massive digital transformation.Intangible digital assets, like software solutions, web services, and more recently deep learn-ing algorithms, artificial intelligence and digital platforms, have been increasingly adoptedthanks to the diffusion and advancements of information and communication technologies.Various observers argue that we could rapidly approach a technological singularity leadingto explosive economic growth. This research work as a whole is aimed at investigatingpotential consequences on our economy deriving from digital technological progress. Inparticular, the contribution of the thesis is both empirical, theoretical and related to modeldesign. On the empirical side, I present a cross-country empirical analysis assessing thecorrelation between the growth rate of both tangible and intangible investments and differentmeasures of productivity growth. The analysis results are used to inform the first of the twoframeworks of the agent-based macro-model Eurace that I employ to assess the long-termimpact of digital investments on economy. In particular, in the first framework, a total factoraugmenting approach has been used in order to model the digital technological progressbecause of the significant and positive correlation between total factor productivity and ICTcapital investments, composed by a combination of both tangible and intangible investmentswhich includes ICT technologies, software and database. In the second framework, I proposea different and innovative approach in which digital technological progress influences theelasticity of substitution between capital and labour. In this way, an increase of the elasticityof substitution can be seen as an increase in the tasks that machines can perform replacinghuman beings. In order to develop this approach, I substitute the Cobb-Douglas productionfunction used in the first framework with a Leontief technology in which input factorsare represented by organizational units. In turn, the contribution of each unit is given bya combination of capital and labour. The second framework results to be more realisticbecause it allows to distinguish between the various activities performed in the companiesand the different education levels characterizing the workforce employed. Computationalexperiments show the emergence of technological unemployment in the long-run with a highpace of intangible digital investments. However, in the elasticity augmenting frameworkcompensation mechanisms work more effectively leading to lower unemployment levelsvcompared to the total factor augmenting one. Both frameworks are able to capture interestingfeatures and empirical evidences characterizing our economic system.Table of contents1 Digital Transformation: an overview 11.1 Digital intangible assets: a literature review . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.2 Productivity and digital assets: an empirical assessment . . . . . . . . . . . 41.3 Digital technological progress and its potential consequences on labour market 112 Modelling the Digital Transformation: the Total Factor Augmenting Approachin Eurace 152.1 Literature overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 152.2 The added value of agent based modelling . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 162.3 The Eurace model with intangible digital assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 182.3.1 Software tools and computational framework . . . . . . . . . . . . 182.3.2 Outline of the baseline Eurace model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 182.3.3 Eurace: a stock-flow-consistent model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 232.3.4 Supply side . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 292.3.5 Demand side . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 302.3.6 Digital asset price dynamics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 332.3.7 Employees’ digital technologies skills . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 342.4 Computational results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 352.4.1 Design of experiments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 352.4.2 “Competitive pricing" and “collusive pricing" business dynamicsanalysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 362.4.3 Competitiveness in the "competitive pricing" case . . . . . . . . . . 392.4.4 The digital economy from a macroeconomic perspective . . . . . . 412.4.5 The “competitive pricing" case: a deeper investigation . . . . . . . 423 Modelling the Digital Transformation: the Elasticity Augmenting Approach 473.1 The elasticity augmenting framework: a short introduction . . . . . . . . . 473.2 The new production technology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48Table of contents vii3.2.1 Integrating the new production technology in the Eurace model . . 503.3 Computational results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 523.3.1 Design of experiments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 523.3.2 The dynamics of the system: a macroeconomic perspective . . . . . 533.3.3 The competitive dynamics between DADs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 603.3.4 Elasticity augmenting approach and total factor augmenting ap-proach: a technological unemployment comparison . . . . . . . . . 61Conclusion 64Bibliography 67Chapter 1Digital Transformation: an overview1.1 Digital intangible assets: a literature reviewIn his 1930 lecture “Economic possibilities for our grandchildren”, John Maynard Keynespredicted that in one hundred years from then, i.e. around 2030, the production problemwould be solved and there would be enough for everyone but machines would cause “tech-nological unemployment”. McKinsey Global Institute in a recent report1 stated that theincreasing adoption of automation technologies, including artificial intelligence and robotics,will generate significant benefits for the economy, raising productivity and economic growth,but with a far-reaching impact on the global workforce. In particular, according to thestudy, around half of current work activities are subject to be technically automatable byadapting current available technologies and, by 2030, 75 million to 375 million workers willbe displaced by automation with the need to change occupation to avoid unemployment.Brian Arthur, one of the pioneers in studying the economics of the digital age, recentlystated2 that we have reached or are close to the above-mentioned “Keynes point”, i.e. a neweconomic era where we are witnessing the “third morphing” of the digital revolution. Inparticular, while the first morphing in the 70s/80s was characterized by the microchip and theavailability of cheap digital calculus, the second morphing in the 90s/00s by the widespreaddiffusion of computer networks, the third morphing is bringing intelligent machines. Thecombination of computers, sensors, big data and statistical learning techniques, providesmachines characterized by the sort of associative intelligence typical of biological beings,then potentially able to substitute humans in a large set of activities.1McKinsey Global Institute, Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained: Workforce Transitions in a Time of Automation,December 2017.2Arthur (2017) Where is technology taking the economy. McKinsey Quarterly1.1 Digital intangible assets: a literature review 2In this respect, the higher efficiency related to the introduction of new digital technologiesgenerally determines a higher productivity which in turn can lead to lower employment, seePianta (2009). Furthermore, it is worth noting that while most of innovations introduced inthe production process until the end of the XX century empowered workers with additionalmechanical energy able to overcome the limits imposed by human physical force, “The Sec-ond Machine Age" (Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014)) characterized by robotics, automation,software and artificial intelligence (AI) might be able to surmount also the limits imposed byhuman mind. Technological unemployment is then becoming the concern not only of “bluecollars" but also of “white collars" workers. However, empirical studies have shown a jobpolarization not completely consistent with the so-called “skill-biased technical change", seeAutor and Dorn (2013); Goos and Manning (2007); Goos et al. (2014). Indeed, the advent ofnew digital technologies has led to a decreasing demand of mid-range workers performingroutine manual and cognitive tasks and, at the same time, to an increasing demand of highsalary non-routine cognitive jobs and low salary non-routine manual jobs.The key element of intelligent machines is software, i.e. the collection and combinationof procedures, instructions and algorithms that set machines and computers behaviour basedon environment and input. Software is an intangible good which is non-rivalrous since itis characterized by zero (or quasi zero) marginal costs. Arthur has investigated since the80s the economic features of software and generally of intangible digital technologies aswell as their effects for business and the economy as whole, see Arthur (1989, 1990, 1994,1996). In particular, he pointed out the existence of two different economic realities: theso-called diminishing and increasing returns world. The former is represented by traditionalmass-production systems whose products require a huge amount of resources and a relativelylower contribution of knowledge, whereas the latter is represented by high-tech companiessuch as digital technologies producers: their products are characterized by a high knowledgecontent and a scarce quantity of resources. Several economic features distinguish increasingreturns business worlds from traditional bulk-production worlds. Arthur mentions networkeffects, positive feedback, path dependence, winner-takes-most/-takes-all outcomes, and thentechnological lock-in. In particular, positive feedbacks reinforce market position of growingcompanies and, at the same time, negatively affect producers with declining market share.In the age of intelligent machines and digital automation, software, databases, artificialintelligence algorithms, and any other sort of intangible digital technologies are playing anincreasingly dominant role with a far-reaching impact on the working of our economies.A recent popular book by Haskel and Westlake (2017) emphasizes the increasing weightof intangible investments in the economy and analyses its consequences. In particular, theauthors point out the four main features that characterize intangible goods, the so-called four1.1 Digital intangible assets: a literature review 3“S": scalability, sunk costs, spillovers, synergies. Scalability is related to the non-rivalrousproperty of intangible goods and their zero (or quasi zero) marginal costs, see also Rifkin(2014). Usually, firms producing this type of goods face high fixed costs, generally given byresearch and/or development costs, compared to their variable production costs. Furthermore,most of times, intangible investments represent sunk costs. A typical example is made bysoftware realized for specific firms and purposes; although this software represents an assetfor them, in case of exit from the market, it is very difficult to recover the initial investment.Intangible investments tend to generate spillover since it may be difficult or expensive toprotect new knowledge generation and other companies can benefit copying or imitatingnew ideas. Finally, the combination of different intangible assets together (or with hardware)spurs innovations, e.g. at organizational level, that can increase companies’ profitability.In other words, synergies create value for firms and, in the “intangible economy", thewillingness to increase their revenues have led to the so-called “open innovation". This factassumes a crucial importance because, from a wider perspective, the nature of technologicalinnovation and progress can be interpreted as based on synergies between different andexisting technologies, as argued by Arthur (2009).It is worth noting that non-rivalrous digital assets do not cover all intangible invest-ments, which include also other relevant assets, like patents, organizational innovations, orinvestments in marketing and brand. However, in the era of intelligent machines and digitalautomation, software, databases and artificial intelligence algorithms clearly deserve thehighest attention among the different kinds of intangible investments.The increasing importance of digital technologies is also shown by digital platforms, likeAmazon, Deliveroo, Glovo, Foodora and Uber, which are typical examples of non rivalrousservices that have considerably affected our economic system both from employment andworking condition perspective, see Kenney and Zysman (2019). The so-called “digitaltaylorism" has emerged, where platforms’ algorithms are able to control, to evaluate andto organize labour activities. Moreover, as in the case of Foodora or Uber, some authorsargue that entrepreneurial risk has been transferred from companies to workers, see Dosi andRoventini (2019).A considerable effort has been spent during years in order to asses the impact of intangibleassets on productivity both at a firm, industry and national level, see Corrado et al. (2016);Hao and Van Ark (2009); Marrocu et al. (2011), respectively. In particular, a sizeable numberof researches using different estimation methods underline the positive effect that intangibleassets have on labour and total factor productivity growth, see Roth (2019).Building on the pioneering insights of Arthur and on the recent contribution by Haskel andWestlake (2017), the study presented in the next section enriches the previous empirical work1.2 Productivity and digital assets: an empirical assessment 4on the relation between measures of productivity and intangible investments. In particular, Iconsider a higher number of countries and different kinds of intangible investments, also incombination with tangible investments in information and communication technologies.The main purpose of this empirical analysis is to inform the design of the first frameworkof the Eurace model used to investigate potential consequences deriving from the digitaltechnological progress. In particular, the study of the relations between different typologiesof investments and productivity turns out to be crucial in order to find an effective way tomodel the effects of investments in digital technologies on the production processes.Results show a significant correlation between intangible investments and both labor andtotal factor productivity in the period after the 2008 financial crisis. Similarly, both measuresof productivity growth are correlated with a combination of both 
tangible and intangibleinvestments which includes information and communication technologies and software anddatabase. Empirical results presented in the next section have been reported in Bertani et al.(2020b).1.2 Productivity and digital assets: an empirical assess-mentFollowing the previous considerations about the digital transformation, the aim of thissection is to provide an empirical and quantitative evidence about the impact of intangibleinvestments on the economy, in particular on the productivity of production factors, i.e. laborand capital, taken singularly and in combination. The investigation is based on a correlationanalysis between the growth rates of different measures of investments and productivity,along the line of the analysis presented in the recent book by Haskel and Westlake (2017),which I extend in many dimensions, in particular, in the number of variables considered,in the number of countries and in the length of the time period examined. The results willinform the development of the new modelling features introduced in the first framework ofthe agent-based macro-model Eurace concerning digital technologies. This first framework,used to address the impact of the digital transformation on the economy and in particular onthe level of unemployment, will be presented in Chapter 2.The role of intangible investments in our economy is becoming increasingly importantover time. In fact, intangible investments have surpassed tangible ones in certain markets,as for example in the United Kingdom (UK), see Goodridge et al. (2012). In addition tosoftware and databases (Soft&DB), other kinds of intangible investments are represented for1.2 Productivity and digital assets: an empirical assessment 5example by investments in R&D, design and engineering, mineral exploration, brands andadvertising, see Corrado et al. (2005); Thum-Thysen et al. (2017).As far as digital technologies are concerned, Fig. 1.1 shows several time series represent-ing the ratio between intangible investments in software and database and gross value added(GVA) for various countries. The ratio between investments in Soft&DB and GVA representsa relative measure which allows to compare the entity of these intangible investments betweencountries regardless of their size and GDP. In fact, although the bigger countries tend toinvest more in absolute terms, their relative data can be lower than in some smaller countries,see the case of USA and Netherlands in Fig. 1.1(a). Except for Italy (IT) and Luxembourg(LU), see Fig. 1.1(b) and (c) respectively, these investments increased between 1995 and2016; in particular Netherlands (NL), France (FR) and Sweden (SW) have experienced thehugest enhancement. This shows the growing importance that digital assets have in oureconomic system.1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016Years01234Soft&DB investments / GVA (%)(a)SWFRNLUSA1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016Years01234Soft&DB investments / GVA (%)(b)ATUKITFI1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016Years01234Soft&DB investments / GVA (%)(c)DKESDEIE1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016Years01234Soft&DB investments / GVA (%)(d)PTLUGRFigure 1.1: The figure shows various time series representing the trend between 1995 (1997only for USA) and 2016 of ratio between software and database intangible investments andgross value added for several countries. Time series are author’ elaboration of EU-KLEMSdata (www.euklems.net) based on a Hodrick–Prescott filter with a smoothing parameterequal to 10. HP filtering has been performed to dampen excessive fluctuations and highlightthe general trend. Time series are organized in sub-figure according to their values: in Fig. 1(a) time series with highest values are displayed and in Fig. 1 (d) time series with lowestones; in Fig. 1 (b) and (c) time series with intermediate values are reported.Along the line of Haskel and Westlake (2017), I have carried out a correlation analysisin order to investigate the relation among different measures of productivity and types ofinvestment. My study takes into account a larger number of countries and it is focused on a1.2 Productivity and digital assets: an empirical assessment 6longer time period of twenty-two years, from 1995 to 2016. I split this time span in a pre andpost crisis time period, i.e., from 1995 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2016. The fifteen countriesconsidered are: Italy (IT), Germany (DE), Netherlands (NL), United Kingdom (UK), UnitedStates (USA), France (FR), Sweden (SW), Spain (ES), Denmark (DK), Portugal (PT), Austria(AT), Finland (FI), Ireland (IE), Greece (GR) and Luxembourg (LU).Moreover, while Haskel and Westlake (2017) productivity-investments correlation anal-ysis focused mainly on total factor productivity (TFP), I extend the analysis to differentmeasures of productivity, namely labour productivity (PL) and capital productivity (PK)3. Asfor investments, I consider the following investment items:• Total intangible investments (Tot Int): they represent the sum of R&D, software,databases, mineral exploration and artistic originals investments;• Intangible investments in software and database (Int Soft&DB);• Intangible investments in R&D (Int R&D);• Total tangible investments (Tot Tang): they represent the sum of ICT equipment,transportation equipment, cultivated assets, non-residential structures, other machineryequipment and weapons investments. I do not consider investments in residentialstructures because the research focuses on those investments that generate productiveassets.• Tangible investments in ICT equipment (Tang ICT).• Tangible investments in ICT equipment together with intangible investments in soft-ware and databases (ICT&Soft&DB). The combination of these investments turnsout to be crucial because of the intrinsic complementarity characterizing hardware3Labour productivity PL measures how efficiently labour input is used in the production of goods andservices. It can be measured as the ratio between GDP and all the persons employed in the production process oras the ratio between GDP and total hours worked. However, in the first case, the measure does not differentiatebetween full-time and part-time employment. Therefore, in my analysis, I consider the hours worked as labourinput variable in the productivity measurement because "it bears a closer relation to the amount of productiveservices provided by workers than simple head counts", see OECD (2001). So, in this case, PL represents theamount of goods and services produced in one hour.As regards capital productivity PK , it measures how efficiently capital input is used within production andit is given by the ratio between GDP and capital services. The latter “refer to the flow of productive servicesprovided by an asset that is employed in production" and “are the appropriate measure of capital input inproduction analysis", see OECD (2001).Finally, total factor productivity (or multifactor productivity) reflects how efficiently labour and capital inputsare employed together in the production process. Several factors can determine TFP variations, as for exampletechnological progress, organizational changes, network effects and spillovers. TFP is measured as the “residualgrowth that cannot be explained by changes in labour and capital inputs", see OECD (2019).1.2 Productivity and digital assets: an empirical assessment 7and software. Hardware is useless without software and viceversa and combiningthese investments I can assess the real importance that digital technologies have in oursociety. Indeed, besides the distinction between “tangible" and “intangible" capital,another kind of common grouping is represented by “ICT" and “Non-ICT" capital(or assets), where ICT capital includes IT, CT and computerized information, namelySoft&DB, see Adarov and Stehrer (2019); Basu et al. (2004).Software and hardware are also strictly related to each other from a technologicalprogress point of view. In fact, according to Brynjolfsson et al. (2018), AI softwareand machine learning improvements are related to the creation of more powerful com-puter hardware (and the availability of larger database). Therefore, complementaryinvestment in hardware turns out to be crucial in order to obtain further softwaredevelopments4.The correlation analysis has been performed combining the EU KLEMS database5(https://euklems.eu), which provided information about investments, and the OECD database(https://stats.oecd.org) for information on productivity growth rates.For each country, time averages of growth rates of different measures of productivity andinvestments have been calculated for each of the three time periods considered. Table 1.1reports correlation coefficients and p-values (in brackets) between this set of country averagegrowth rates. Asterisks points out statistically significant results6.Table 1.2 reports main statistical moments, i.e. mean and standard deviation σ, ofinvestments and productivities growth rates for four representative countries among thoseanalyzed: Greece (EL), Ireland (IE), Germany (DE), and United States (USA). Thesecountries have been chosen according to their position in the data distribution. In particular,Greece has been chosen as the representative of the lower bound, Ireland as the representativeof the upper one and Germany as median. USA is included because of its importance in theworld economy. Statistical moments refer to two different time periods, namely 1997-20074Besides tangible investments in ICT assets, Brynjolfsson et al. (2018) argue that AI software needscomplementary investments in other intangible assets, namely databases, human capital and organizationalcapital.5EU KLEMS database (where KLEMS stands for capital (K), labour (L), energy (E), material (M) andservice (S) inputs) collects data on industry level measures of productivity, capital formation, technologicalchange, economic growth and employment creation for the European union members, Japan and USA. Thesedata are meant to be used as effective inputs for policy evaluation and statistical analysis. For my research, Ihave gathered investments data from the EU KLEMS Release 2019, see Adarov and Stehrer (2019); Stehreret al. (2019).6Assuming a null hypothesis of non-correlation I consider three different levels of significance: a singleasterisk is used when p-values are lower than 0.1 whereas two and three asterisks are used when p-values arelower than 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.1.2 Productivity and digital assets: an empirical assessment 8Table 1.1: The table shows the correlation coefficients and p-values (in brackets) between thesets of country time averages of different kinds of investments and productivities growth rates.Time averages refer to three different time periods, i.e. 1997-2007, 2008-2016, 1997-2016,except for IE whose averages refer to shorter time periods because of the lack of data, namely1997-2007, 2008-2014, 1997-2014. They have been considered three types of productivity(total factor productivity (TFP), labour productivity (PL) and capital productivity (PK)) andfour types of investment (total intangible investments, intangible investments in softwareand database, total tangible investments (without considering dwellings investments) andtangible investments in ICT). Significant results have been pointed out with asterisks: asingle asterisk is used when p-values are lower than 0.1 whereas two and three asterisksare used when p-values are lower than 0.05 and 0.01 respectively.

In this respect, it is worth notingthat capital productivity, measured as the ratio between GDP and capital services, has beendecreasing in most OECD countries for the past twenty years, see OECD (2019), and thisfact may have affected the result.In the time period 2008−2016 a considerable part of the results turns out to be highlysignificant, highlighting a positive correlation between productivity and investments. In thistime period, TFP average growth rate is significantly and positively correlated with totalintangible, R&D, total tangible, ICT equipment and ICT&Soft&DB investments averagegrowth rates. Also labour productivity PL is positively correlated with total intangible, R&D,ICT equipment and ICT&Soft&DB investments.Even though the 1997−2007 time period is characterized mainly by positive relationsamong variables, I did not find significant results.Fig. 1.2 show the scatter plot between TFP and total intangible investments averagegrowth rates in the 1997− 2007 and 2008− 2016 time periods. The comparison of thesetwo plots highlights an increase in the correlation between variables in the 2008− 2016time period, even though the growth rates tend to be lower. The same considerations holdalso for R&D and ICT&Soft&DB investments average growth rates, presented in Figures1.3 and 1.4. In 2008−2016 time periods, even though the positive correlation coefficient1.2 Productivity and digital assets: an empirical assessment 10between TFP and Soft&DB intangible investments is not significant, TFP turns out to besignificantly and positively correlated with the sum of Soft&DB and ICT equipment that hasbeen called ICT&Soft&DB (the correlation coefficient is equal to 0.6519). This fact pointsout the complementary roles of hardware and software.The higher correlation coefficients in the post-crisis period of 2008−2016 might also beexplained along the lines of the cleansing effect of recessions, introduced by Caballero andHammour (1994). According to 
this idea, recessions can be seen as times of "cleansing" whenoutdated or relatively unprofitable techniques and products are pruned out of the productivesystem. Therefore, after the crisis of 2007, investments in new technology induced a higherproductivity growth with respect to the previous decade. Of course, many other factor mighthave affected this result, in particular the political response in terms of institutional reformsor economic policies. However, it is worth noting that the cleansing effect typically occurs inall countries, irrespective of their local institutional arrangement or market structure.0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16Total intangible investments average growth rate (%)-2.5-2-1.5-1-0.500.511.522.5TFP average growth rate (%)(a) 1997-2007ITDENLUKUSAFRSEESDK PTATFI IEELLU-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8Total intangible investments average growth rate (%)-2.5-2-1.5-1-0.500.511.522.5TFP average growth rate (%)(b) 2008-2016ITDENLUKUSAFRSEESDKPTATFIIEELLUFigure 1.2: The figure shows two scatter plots between country TFP and total intangibleinvestments average growth rates (%).

New technolo-gies have always generated apprehension among the working class and even if the debateamong economists is still open, most of them agree on distinguishing between short andlong run effects. According to this distinction, in the short term innovation determineslower employment levels and wages, whereas in the long term the higher productivity in theproduction systems could determine an increase in employment and wages, see Mokyr et al.(2015). In this respect, Ricardo (1821) argued that even though the introduction of machineryis injurious to labour class, the short term displacement is only temporary: in the long run, thetechnological unemployment leaves room to a higher labour demand. Therefore, accordingto a sizable part of economists, the unemployment effect related to technological progressis not constant, but it is absorbed by the economic system itself over time. In this respect,Schumpeter (1939) affirms that economic cycles are strictly related to technological progress.The latter leads to economic expansion periods followed by recession phases characterizedby supernormal unemployment. In the thought of Schumpeter, cyclical unemployment1.3 Digital technological progress and its potential consequences on labour market 123 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13ICT&Soft&DB investments average growth rate (%)-2.5-2-1.5-1-0.500.511.522.5TFP average growth rate (%)(a) 1997-2007ITDE NLUKUSAFRSEESDKPTATFIIEELLU-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8ICT&Soft&DB investments average growth rate (%)-2.5-2-1.5-1-0.500.511.522.5TFP average growth rate (%)(b) 2008-2016ITDENLUKFRSEFIIEELLUATDKUSAESPTFigure 1.4: The figure shows two scatter plots between country TFP and ICT&Soft&DBinvestments average growth rates (%).

Source: authorsestimations based on EU-KLEMS ((https://euklems.eu)) and OECD (https://stats.oecd.org)data.corresponds to technological unemployment and it is related to innovation process whichconstitutes the essence of economic system evolution.Obviously, technological progress does not always involve the same result. In this respect,we can differentiate between two different kinds of technological innovation, i.e. product andprocess innovation. The positive impact on employment resulting from the former has beenhighlighted and underpinned by various researches, see e.g. Edquist et al. (2001); Vivarelliand Pianta (2000), whereas the latter differs in its labour-saving nature allowing to producethe same amount of output using less workforce. In fact, thanks to product innovation newmarkets can be opened leading to an increase of production and employment, while processinnovation involves higher level of productivity determining a lower employment in theproduction system, see Pianta (2009). It is worth noting that two main analysis levels canbe distinguished in order to investigate process innovation effects, namely the firm-leveland the industry-level. In this regard, according to Acemoglu et al. (2020), although firmsadopting automation decrease their workforce share in the production process, their overallemployment increases. In other words, process innovation induces a positive employmenteffect at the firm-level. In fact, the adoption of automation determines a cost reduction and aconsequent increase of their market shares. However, their expansion on the market occurs1.3 Digital technological progress and its potential consequences on labour market 13at the expense of their competitors and it causes a negative overall effect on employment atthe industry-level.According to the so-called “Compensation Theory", the negative effects linked to labour-unfriendly process innovation are counteracted by several economic forces triggered by thetechnological progress itself, see Petit (1993). In this respect, Vivarelli (2014) distinguishesbetween six different compensation effects: the compensation mechanism “via additionalemployment in the capital goods sector", “via decrease in prices", “via new investments", “viadecrease in wages", “via increase in incomes" and “via new products". Similarly, according toAcemoglu and Restrepo (2018a), the so-called “displacement effect" caused by the adoptionof digital technologies within production processes is counteracted by four countervailingeffects: the productivity effect, capital accumulation, deepening of automation and thecreation of new labour-intensive tasks. In particular, for the authors the creation of newtasks and jobs in which human labour has a comparative advantage compared to capitalrepresents the most effective force capable of balancing the replacement of workers withautomated machines. According to Vermeulen and Pyka (2014), because of countervailingeffects triggered by the technological progress itself, the diffusion of artificial intelligence(AI) and robots is determining a typical structural change rather than the so-called “end ofwork".However, it is worth highlighting that the nature of the new digital technological waveexperienced by our society is completely different compared to the previous ones. Most ofinnovations introduced within production systems until the end of the XXth century had thepurpose to produce a huge amount of mechanical energy allowing to surmount the limitsimposed by human physical force. As mentioned in the first section of this chapter, nowadays,according to Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), we are experiencing a new technologicalrevolution called “The Second Machine Age". In this new era, trough the adoption ofnew digital technologies such as AI, we can overcome limits imposed by our mind. Inthis respect, the primary objective to be pursued adopting these new digital instruments isrepresented by the automation of decision-making processes and this new kind of automationmakes us reflect about its potential future consequences on the labour market. Furthermore,various economists and technologists contemplate the possibility that further developments incomputation and artificial intelligence will lead us to a technological singularity, see Aghionet al. (2017); Good (1966); Nordhaus (2015), and the economic and social consequences ofthese advances could be really disruptive.In the next chapter, I am going to present the first framework of the Eurace model con-cerning digital technologies that has been developed in order to study potential consequencesof the digital transformation. In this first framework, by virtue of the positive and significant1.3 Digital technological progress and its potential consequences on labour market 14correlation between ICT&Soft&DB and TFP, I have decided to model digital technologicalprogress through a total factor augmenting approach.Chapter 2Modelling the Digital Transformation:the Total Factor Augmenting Approachin Eurace2.1 Literature overviewThe main purpose of the thesis is to study the potential effects deriving from the digitaltechnological progress on our economy. In this regard, modelling the digital transformationturns out to be crucial in order to forecast the consequences for the economy related to theadvent of new digital technologies.The debate on how to represent the potential effects deriving from their adoption inproduction processes is still open. Current literature includes different methods that havebeen developed in order to assess unemployment, productivity change and wage inequalityderiving from the digital transformation. One of these is represented by including AI withinproduction functions as a new (production) factor, see DeCanio (2016); Hanson (2001);Lankisch et al. (2019). Moreover, as pointed out by Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018d), severalresearchers have modelled the introduction of automation and AI in the manufacturing sectoras a factor augmenting technical change and digital transformation is represented by anincrease in factor productivity, see Acemoglu (2003). For instance, Graetz and Michaels(2018); Nordhaus (2015); Sachs and Kotlikoff (2012) frame automation and AI impactas a capital-augmenting technical change, whereas Bessen (2016, 2018, 2019) representsautomation as labour-augmenting.2.2 The added value of agent based modelling 16It is worth noting that Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017, 2018a,b,c,d) point out someweaknesses of the factor augmenting approach in equilibrium models1 and they adopt the so-called task-based approach based on the pioneering contribution by Zeira (1998): automationadvent is represented as an increase in the number of tasks that can be performed by machines.Similarly, Aghion et al. (2017) develops AI through a task-based model.2.2 The added value of agent based modellingThe criticism by Acemoglu and Restrepo holds in equilibrium models, whereas is notdirectly applicable to the disequilibrium approach which is the distinguishing feature ofagent-based simulation models as the one presented in this chapter. In particular, differentlyfrom equilibrium models whose main purpose is to find the static vector of prices equatingagents’ demand and supply schedules and making their expectations self-fulfilling, agent-based computational modelling studies how agents’ actions, strategies, or expectationsendogenously change out-of-equilibrium and the aggregate economic patterns that thisdynamic process creates, see Arthur (2006, 2010). An example of how micro-level behaviorgives rise to a macro-level regularity, which is interesting in this context, is the networkeffect in the adoption of a technological standard, i.e. the empirically-grounded modellingfeature according to whom the likelihood of adoption depends not only on the (not perfectlyknown) quality of the standard but also on the number of its current users. This micro choicebehaviour can give rise in the long-run to a winner-take-all standard, which is not necessarilythe superior one from the technological standpoint, see Arthur (1989). Furthermore, whois the winner can not be foreseen ex-ante based on agents’ preferences, as in a standardequilibrium model, since the final outcome is path-dependent and small unpredictableexogenous stochastic disturbances during the dynamic selection process can give rise todifferent final outcomes. This macro level regularity can then be compared with the empiricalevidence, see e.g. the case of software industry Arthur (1996).Agent-based macroeconomic model arose as an alternative to neoclassical economicmodels, describing the economy as a complex evolving system in which macro dynamics(e.g. business cycle, long run growth) emerge out of the micro interactions among boundedrational agents, see Gallegati (2018); Hommes and LeBaron (2018); LeBaron and Tesfatsion(2008); North and Macal (2007). Differently from the structural macro models of the 70s,1Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018d) argue that “factor-augmenting technologies have a limited scope to reducethe demand for labor". Another criticism made by the same authors refers to the impact of technology onlabour share in national income: it is strictly related to the elasticity of substitution between production factors.Conversely, they argue that task-based approach “always reduces the labor share and it reduces labor demandand the equilibrium wage unless the productivity gains from automation are sufficiently large."2.2 The added value of agent based modelling 17agent-based macroeconomics introduce explicit micro-foundations based on empiricallyobserved behaviours of individuals and organizations. Agents’ decisions and adaptation areembedded in a world characterised by true Knightian uncertainty and dispersed information.Agent-based modelling represents an appropriate approach in order to address complexityand the main features characterizing the increasing returns world to which digital technologyproducers belong. Out-of-equilibrium dynamics, complex interactions among economicagents and heterogeneity are three important features that can be encompassed by agent-based modelling. Since the AI advent can be framed as a transition phase in the history oftechnological progress, an out-of-equilibrium approach, such as the agent-based one, canbe an effective way to represent this structural and productive transformation. Furthermore,by capturing heterogeneity between economic agents we can distinguish between differenttypes of productive capital: hard capital and intangible or digital capital. The need forheterogeneity to study the potential effect of a digital transformation is also reflected bythe labour force: workers are heterogeneous and they differ in skills. Finally, interactionsdrive several features of the “increasing returns” world, such as for example network effects,lock-in and winner-take-most-phenomena. These are the reasons why I adopted this approachin order to conduct my research.It is crucial to point out that the concept of innovation has already been investigated bymeans of agent based models (see e.g Caiani et al. (2019); Dawid and Reimann (2011); Dosiet al. (2010); Fanti (2018); Ponsiglione et al. (2017); Pyka et al. (2010); Rengs et al. (2020);Vermeulen and Pyka (2014, 2018)), and also the well known large-scale macroeconomicagent-based model Eurace has been endowed with the concept of innovation, see Dawidand Gemkow (2014); Dawid et al. (2008, 2019, 2014, 2018). However, this research isfocused on innovation from the perspective of productivity increases due to intangible digitalcapital goods, not only tangible ones. Software, algorithms, artificial intelligence 
and theirdevelopers are the subject of my study, as I want to link the concept of innovation to the one of“digital revolution", as described in Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011). The addition of digitaltechnologies in the Eurace model mimics the advent of Industry 4.0, according to whichnot only are the production processes automated, but also decisions start to be subject toautomation technology, see Cotteleer and Sniderman (2017); Kang et al. (2016); Parrott andLane (2017). From a macro perspective, the research work tries to address and evaluate thepotential effect of a digital transformation on the economic system. Furthermore, at a microlevel, my analysis aims to study the main business dynamics characterising digital technologyproducers. In this respect, the novelty of my contribution concerns the introduction of anew type of capital producer within Eurace: the intangible or digital assets developer. Theintroduction of this new kind of firm, which belongs to the “increasing returns world”, turns2.3 The Eurace model with intangible digital assets 18out to be crucial in order to better understand and investigate the economic implication ofdigital technologies on business, both from a macro and micro point of view. In fact, being abottom up approach, agent-based modelling gives us the opportunity to study not only themacroeconomic trend of the system but also the sectorial behaviours.2.3 The Eurace model with intangible digital assets2.3.1 Software tools and computational frameworkThe baseline Eurace model and its extensions have been implemented using the FlexibleLarge-scale Agent Modelling Environment (FLAME). This software represents a flexibleand generic agent-based modelling platform that can be used to model and simulate complexsystem applications in various research fields, as for example economics and biology. TheFLAME software generates agent-based applications whose compilation and deploymentcan be performed both on laptops and high performance computers2.Models developed through this software are based on a specific method of computationwhose name is extended finite state machines. Indeed, each agent is represented as acomputational state machine which is composed of a certain number of states with transitionfunctions between them. Agents are endowed with a memory containing variables andtransition functions can read and write to these variables. Moreover, transition functions canalso read and write incoming and outgoing messages used in order to achieve communicationbetween agents. The model description is implemented in Extensible Markup Language(XML) tag structures, whereas transition functions are written used the C programminglanguage.FLAME is used in order to implement and simulate the Eurace model, whereas the outputanalysis is performed with Matlab.2.3.2 Outline of the baseline Eurace modelBuilding on the empirical analysis presented in Chapter 1, which shows a clear effect ofinvestments in ICT&Soft&DB on TFP, I have developed a new extension of Eurace, seeMazzocchetti et al. (2020, 2018); Petrović et al. (2017); Ponta et al. (2018); Raberto et al.(2012); Teglio et al. (2019, 2012). In particular, the extension presented in this chapter hasbeen described in Bertani et al. (2020a,b).2See www.flame.ac.uk for further details on FLAME.2.3 The Eurace model with intangible digital assets 19The model includes several types of economic agents, in particular: consumption goodsproducers (CGPs) that manufacture homogeneous consumption goods; a capital goodsproducer (KGP), which produces investment goods (for instance machine tools); households(HHs), that perform as workers, financial investors and consumers; and commercial banks(Bs). There are also two policy maker agents: the government (G) and the central bank(CB), responsible for fiscal and monetary policy, respectively. In order to study the impactof digital technologies on the economic system, a new economic agent, i.e., the intangibledigital assets developer (DAD), has been designed and included in the model.A graphical illustration of the Eurace model version that has been used in this paper isreported in Fig. 2.1. Ellipses and rectangles represent the different agent typologies, whereasarrows indicate the presence of current account monetary flows between the correspondingagents. In particular, rectangles are used when only one instance of the agent class isconsidered (and simulated) in the model, e.g. one government, while ellipses show thepresence of multiple heterogeneous instances of that agent class, e.g. several banks. Theyellow background refers to a newly introduced agent.Agents interact in different decentralised or centralised artificial markets. The centralisedare consumption and capital goods, labour and credit markets, whereas decentralised is thefinancial market where firms’ (or banks’) stocks and government’s bonds are traded. Boundedrationality, limited capabilities of computation and limited information gathering characteriseagents’ behaviour. Finally, the Stock-Flow-consistency approach represents a distinctivefeature of the Eurace model, where each agent is in fact represented as a dynamic balancesheet which includes the details regarding assets and liabilities; see Godin and Caverzasi(2014); Godley and Lavoie (2012); Raberto et al. (2018).The shortest time step in the model scheduling is the day, which is the frequency forfinancial market transactions, however, most agents’ decisions occur on a weekly, monthly,or even yearly periodicity, and are asynchronous. Consumption budget decisions are mademonthly by households but purchases are made on a weekly basis; all firms’ decision aboutproduction planning have a monthly asynchronous periodicity, i.e., each firm has its ownactivation day in the month. Finally, policy makers act on a monthly or yearly basis.2.3TheEuracemodelwithintangibledigitalassets20Figure 2.1: Graphical representation of the present Eurace model in terms of agent classes (ellipses or rectangles) and current accountmonetary flows (arrows). Rectangles are used when just one instance of the class in considered in the model, whereas ellipses areintended to represent the presence of multiple heterogeneous instances of the agent class. The yellow background refers to a newlyintroduced agent.2.3 The Eurace model with intangible digital assets 21In the following, I present a summary of the core decisions taken by the main agents inthe model.HouseholdThe household is active in the financial, labour, goods and housing markets. As a trader,it allocates its financial wealth among the available assets, which are bonds issued by thegovernment and the stock of firms and banks. As a worker, if unemployed, the householdenters the labour market to evaluate pending job offers. It is randomly queued to applyto the set of available jobs with the highest wages, provided that they are higher than thereservation wage. Households receive a monthly salary, which constitutes, along with thefinancial returns on bonds and stocks, the total income of the household. On the basis of totalincome, households decide the consumption budget, according to a target wealth to incomeratio, in line with the buffer-stock saving behaviour theory (Carroll (2001)). Households’decisions about the product to buy are driven by purchasing probabilities based on price.Firm (CGP)The firm in the Eurace model takes decisions about the factors of production and how tofinance them. Firms can ask credit from banks or they can issue new shares. They distributedividends to shareholders, which are initially all households (later it depends on financialmarket transactions). In particular, I present the core of the scheduling procedure for firms.• The firm estimates the expected demand based on past sales.• It determines the new desired production, given the level of the current inventory stock.• It computes the labour force needed to meet the production target, determining thelabour demand, and posting vacancies (if any), or firing. In particular, if the numberof workers is higher than that needed by the production target, CGP fires the workersin excess, otherwise it enters the labour market to hire new employees. CGP sets aninitial wage offer and, if it is not capable of hiring all the workers needed, it increasesthe initial offer by a fixed parameter and starts a second round. If the target is notreached for the second time, CGP exits the labour market. However, it increases thewage offer again and this will be the initial offer for the next monthly labour marketsession, see Teglio et al. (2019).• It determines a desired level of investment by comparing the net present value offuture additional cash flows with the current cost of investment. Investment goods areproduced by the capital goods producer (KGP).2.3 The Eurace model with intangible digital assets 22• The firm looks for financing, following the pecking order theory: first retained earnings,then debt, then equity.• If rationed, the firm reduces costs in order to make the total financial needs consistentwith the available resources. First, the total dividend payout is reduced to zero, then, ifstill not sufficient, the investment plan is sized down and, eventually, the productionplan as well.• The firm can go bankrupt, undergoing a restructuring of its debt with a related loanwrite-off and a corresponding equity loss on creditor banks’ balance sheets, and stayinginactive for a period of time after which it enters the market again with a healthy balancesheet. Physical capital of insolvent firms is therefore not lost but remains inactive for awhile.Bank (B)The bank role in the model is to provide credit to private agents; to firms in the form ofloans and to households in the form of mortgages. When a bank receives a loan request froma firm, the request is evaluated and a loan eventually offered at a price that depends on therisk associated to the default probability of the firm. A similar procedure is used by the bankto assess the creditworthiness of households asking for mortgage loans (details are in Ozelet al. (2019)). Bank’s lending is also limited by the obligation to respect the minimum capitalrequirements enforced by Basel II regulation. It is worth noting that money in the model isendogenous, as new deposits are created every time a bank issues new credit.Policy makersThe central bank provides liquidity in infinite supply to banks, acting as lender of lastresort. It also sets the policy rate according to a dual mandate rule, i.e., low unemploymentand stable prices.The government ensures a welfare system through fiscal policy. Taxes come from cor-porate earnings, consumption (VAT), financial income and labour income. Governmentexpenditures include the public sector wage bill, unemployment benefits, transfers, andinterest payment on debt. On a monthly basis, if it is short of liquidity, the government issuesnew bonds, which are perpetuities that pay a monthly fixed coupon.The model has not been calibrated to any specific real-world economy; however, it isworth noting that all agents’ balance sheet variables have been initialised in a consistent wayand with relative ratios derived from the literature or from the empirical evidence observed inadvanced economies. For instance, the initial debt-to-equity ratio of firms is set to 2, which is2.3 The Eurace model with intangible digital assets 23a realistic value for companies in the industrial sector; banks’ equity to risk-weighted assetsratio is initialised to 20%. Furthermore, the initial value of public debt is set to a value that,assuming a 10% unemployment rate and the initial productive capacity of firms, would set thedebt-to-GDP ratio at around 100%, which is in line with the average Eurozone value. As forempirical validation, it is worth noting that the simulated time series generated by the modelmatch the main stylised facts about volatility of investments and consumption and about thecorrelation structure of GDP. In particular, I observed that GDP is positively correlated withinvestments and consumption, and it is anti-correlated with the unemployment rate. GDPalso shows a positive correlation with firms’ loans, which lead business cycle expansion,and an anti-correlation with firms’ defaults, which follow a contraction of the economy. Forfurther details about the validation and calibration of the model, see Teglio et al. (2019).As pointed out by Platt (2019), further developments of agent-based model calibrationtechniques are required in order to definitively calibrate large-scale models, like Eurace;however, future researches will explore the feasibility of a full calibration of the model or ofpart of it, by resorting to Bayesian inference.2.3.3 Eurace: a stock-flow-consistent modelFollowing Godley and Lavoie (2012) and Godin and Caverzasi (2014), a compact descriptionof the stock-flow-consistent Eurace model is presented through the following tables that out-line the stocks (balance sheet entries) and flows (income statement entries) that characterisethe Eurace agents.The stock-flow-consistent modelling approach provides a set of relevant theoreticalidentities to the agent, sector, and aggregate level, whose subsistence need to be numericallyverified during the simulation, thus providing a very important diagnostic and validation toolfor the model and its implementation.The first table presented is the agent class balance sheet table (Table 2.1), that shows theasset and liability entries of each particular agent type.The second one is the sectorial balance sheet table (Table 2.2), that presents the assets andliabilities aggregated over a sector (all agents belonging to the same class). Columns reportthe aggregated balance sheet of each sector, whereas rows identify the relations betweensectors by spotting the liabilities (with minus sign) in one sector and the corresponding claims,i.e. assets (with plus sign), in another sector, thus generally summing to zero. Exceptions are:the capital goods accumulated by firms; inventories; housing units and equity shares3 ownedby households.3I assume that equity shares in households’ portfolio do not sum to zero with the corresponding equitycounterpart in the issuer balance sheet because of the usual difference between market price and book value.2.3 The Eurace model with intangible digital assets 24The third table is the cash flow matrix (Table 2.3), which shows the monetary flowsamong sectors, both in the current and capital account. The current account reports aggregaterevenues (plus sign) and payments (minus sign) among sectors, therefore summing to zeroalong the rows. The capital account reports the endogenous money creation/destructionoperations by means of borrowing/debt repayment by private agents with banks. Theseoperations, along with the current account net cash flows, determine the liquidity change of asector.Finally, the fourth is the revaluation matrix (Table 2.4) that provides information aboutchanges in sectors’ net worth (equity) between periods. In particular, agents’ net worthdynamics depends on net cash flows in the current account, physical capital depreciationand price changes in financial (stocks and bonds) and real (housing units, capital goods andinventories of consumption goods) assets.2.3 The Eurace model with intangible digital assets 25Table 2.1: Balance sheets of any agent class characterising the Eurace economy. Balancesheet entries in the table have a subscript character, which is the index of an agent in the classto which the variable refers. In some cases, we can find two subscript characters, where thesecond one refers to the index of an agent in another class where there is the balance-sheetcounterpart. For instance, D f refers to the total debt of a firm f , i.e. a liability, and Lb refersto the aggregate loans of a bank b, i.e. an asset. ℓ f ,b (or ℓb, f ) refer to the loans granted bybanks b to firms f . Of course, ∑b Lb = ∑ f ℓb, f represents an aggregate balance sheet identity,that is verified throughout the entire simulation. nEh,x represent the number of outstandingequity shares of agents x held by households h. The market price of the equity shares isgiven by pEx . The stock portfolio’s value of household h is then computed as: ∑x nEh,x pEx .Government bond numbers and market price are given by nG and pG, respe
