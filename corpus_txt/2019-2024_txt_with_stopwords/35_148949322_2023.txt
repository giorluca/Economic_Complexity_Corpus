However, few studies have focused on theimpact of AI industry agglomeration on economic complexity.This study uses a unique dataset of 2,503,795 AI enterprises inChina collected through web crawlers to measure AI industrialagglomeration and examine the relationship between AI industryagglomeration and economic complexity in 194 Chinese citiesbased on Marshall industry agglomeration theory. The study’sresults show that AI industry clustering increases economic com-plexity. The mechanism analysis indicates that people and know-ledge are the channels through which it boosts economiccomplexity. Unexpectedly, AI industry agglomeration does notimprove the economic complexity index (ECI) through the goodspath. This study proposes three possible explanations for thisresult. First, AI industrial clustering may lead to excessive rivalry inChina’s intermediate product market. Hence, sharing intermediateinputs has no increasing returns effect. Second, the city’s high-end talent is not fairly distributed due to China’s uneven develop-ment. Finally, policies drive the formation of China’s AI industrialagglomeration, which does not develop naturally. Consequently,China should implement a talent- and knowledge-driven AIagglomeration. To avoid overcrowding, policies must matchregional development.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 6 January 2022Accepted 6 June 2022KEYWORDSArtificial intelligence;industry agglomeration;economic complexity;agglomeration externalityJEL*F43; L89; R121.

Many scholarshave found that the development of AI improves companies’ management, cost bene-fits, and production efficiency (Matyushok et al., 2021; Wilson & Daugherty, 2018).However, few scholars have focused on the effect of AI on the product complexityindex (PCI) or economic complexity index (ECI). The nature and measurements ofeconomic complexity and product complexity are similar; hence, the ECI may be con-sidered an overall measurement of the PCI of a city, region, or country (Mealyet al., 2019).Product complexity increases by breaking through existing technologies and intro-ducing new products (Hidalgo, 2021). Some scholars have suggested that the determi-nants of product complexity differ between developed and developing countries(Hidalgo, 2021; Mealy et al., 2019). The higher product sophistication of exports indeveloped countries is mainly due to higher income levels and economic growth(Mealy et al., 2019), higher technical levels (Hidalgo, 2021), lower trade costs(Nguyen et al., 2020), and the growth of research and development (R&D) investment(Hidalgo, 2021). Developing countries exhibit lower product complexity but are typic-ally affected by the technology spillover of foreign direct investment (FDI)(Antonietti & Franco, 2021), tariff reduction, and trade liberalisation (Mealy &Teytelboym, 2020). Empirical studies using cross-country samples have shown thatimprovements in institutional quality, labour division, R&D investment, and indus-trial agglomeration increase the complexity of export products (Dai & Jin, 2014).Many scholars have investigated whether industrial agglomeration may improveproduct sophistication but have not reached a consensus (Klein & Crafts, 2020; Mo &He, 2013; Pavelkova et al., 2021). Most scholars contend that industrial agglomerationreduces the uncertainty of developing high-tech products by generating positive exter-nalities (Klein & Crafts, 2020) and the cost of breaking through existing technologies(Mo & He, 2013) to improve the technical complexity of products, ultimately increas-ing the regional ECI. Other studies suggest that economic agglomeration mayincrease competitiveness among businesses and help them build political links(Pavelkova et al., 2021). This phenomenon may hinder product complexity.AI industrial agglomeration is defined as the concentration of enterprises using AItechnologies and connected companies in a geographical area owing to their commonal-ities and complementarities. According to Marshall’s theory of agglomeration external-ities (Marshall, 2009), agglomeration in the AI industry may generate externalitiesthrough labour reservoirs (people), intermediate product sharing (goods), and know-ledge and technology spillovers (knowledge), reducing production costs and increasinglabour productivity. Economies of scale may be achieved by sharing intermediate prod-ucts and public goods, reducing transportation costs per unit distance, and sharing com-pany information (Deng, 2021; Fan & Scott, 2009; X. Wang et al., 2021). However, asthe degree of AI industry agglomeration increases, public resources face increasing pres-sure (Pavelkova et al., 2021; X. Wang et al., 2021). Companies may abandon key techno-logical advancements favouring simpler ones (Meliciani & Savona, 2015), and overagglomeration of the AI industry has a crowding-out effect (X. Wang et al., 2021).Moreover, research based on micro-geographical perspectives (X. Wang et al., 2021)indicates an unequal agglomeration effect on product innovation.ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 1421Most research on high-tech industry agglomeration has focused on industrialisedcountries (Ellison et al., 2010; Meliciani & Savona, 2015; Pavelkova et al., 2021).Hence, whether the conclusions and policy recommendations from industrialisedcountries also apply to China is unclear. Therefore, the impact of China’s AI industryagglomeration on economic complexity must be further explored. First, due to itslow-cost advantages and demographic rewards, China has achieved miraculous eco-nomic growth and export development since its reforms and opening up (Krugman,1994). China’s economic growth is constrained by an unequal industrial structure,low export added value, and a lack of neck-locking technology (Liu & Tie, 2020). Asthe Chinese society and the economy evolve, the role of AI expands (Furman &Seamans, 2019; Martın & Fernandez, 2022). China has made AI a national priority,seeking to use AI to improve technology and increase product complexity (Xie et al.,2021). China’s population and industrial structure have created enough data and mar-ket needs for AI development. In addition, the agglomeration effect is strongly relatedto geographic distance (Klein & Crafts, 2020; Shao et al., 2018), and China has a largegeographical area and considerable regional disparity. Finally, China’s industrialagglomeration model is distinct from that of industrialised countries (Shao et al.,2018; X. Wang et al., 2021). Instead of market economies of scale, policies haveinduced China’s industrial agglomeration (X. Wang et al., 2021). Therefore, the clus-tering effect of China’s AI industry is complex.Can AI industry agglomeration boost product complexity or the ECI? If so, howdoes the AI industry promote ECI growth? Is there any disparity in the impact of AIindustry agglomeration across regions? The solution to these questions is directlyrelated to whether China may upgrade its industry and enhance its developmentquality, leading to a new wave of competition and advantages.To explore these issues, we construct a novel dataset of 2,503,795 AI enterprisesusing web crawler technology to measure industrial agglomeration in China. To thebest of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess AI industry agglomeration atthe city level. We extend previous studies on the impact of AI on the social economyby examining the relationship between AI industry agglomeration and ECI. Finally,we build on Marshall’s theory of agglomeration externalities to explore the inner-impact mechanism in the relationship of interest.The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the litera-ture. Section 3 formulates the research hypotheses, and Section 4 describes the varia-bles, data sources, and empirical models. Section 5 presents and discusses theempirical results, exploring the impact mechanism of AI industry agglomeration onthe ECI. Finally, Section 6 concludes and provides policy implications.2. Literature reviewThe impact of AI on social and business economies is crucial. Researchers haveexamined the effects of AI on economic growth (Furman & Seamans, 2019), employ-ment (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019; Frey & Osborne, 2017; Mutascu, 2021), corporatecompetition (Sun & Hou, 2021), and company managerial efficiency (Di Vaio et al.,2020) at various levels. Some (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019; Brynjolfsson et al., 2019)1422 Y. SHOUFU ET AL.argue that AI-derived technology boosts efficiency but not productivity. According toBergeaud et al. (2017), from 1890 to 2015, the total factor productivity growth ratesof the United States, the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, and Japan have continuedto decline, casting doubts on the impact of AI (Frey & Osborne, 2017). Some studiescontend that AI increases unemployment and inequality (Acemoglu & Restrepo,2019). Mutascu (2021) predicts that AI will replace 54% of occupations in Europe inthe next 10–20 years. Others propose that AI may supplement existing labour andassets, enhancing labour productivity (Graetz & Michaels, 2018) and capital efficiency(Brynjolfsson et al., 2019). According to Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019), automationreplaces and creates new jobs. They contend that the employment creation effect mayboost productivity by increasing the demand for labour in non-automated tasks.At the micro level, AI influences corporate operations and decision-making innumerous industries (Di Vaio et al., 2020; Goldfarb & Trefler, 2019). Sun and Hou(2021) reveal that the development of AI in China boosts the total factor productivityof traditional manufacturing industries such as textiles and apparel. However, AI hasno significant effect on disruptive high-end manufacturing industries such as com-puter communications. Scholars have also investigated AI’s impact on company man-agement. For instance, Di Vaio et al. (2020) contend that AI and related technologyinfluence corporate human resource management and reputation risk management.According to new trade theory, AI impacts business export decisions and global trade(Goldfarb & Trefler, 2019). However, few studies have examined whether AI mayincrease product complexity and, thus, exportability.The existing PCI/ECI investigations focus on their measurements and determi-nants. Several authors have proposed ECI metrics. For instance, Hidalgo andHausmann (2009) have introduced a reflection method to measure economic com-plexity. However, Tacchella et al. (2012) have pointed out that Hidalgo andHausmann’s (2009) measure ignores the link between competitive advantage andexport diversification. They propose a new nonlinear iterative algorithm to define aself-consistent and non-monetary index for product and economic sophisticationfrom a data-driven perspective. Furthermore, some studies contend that economiccomplexity reflects a country’s technological strengths, as regional diversification islinked to technology portfolios (Ivanova et al., 2017). Ivanova et al. (2017) considercountries, product groups, and patents to measure economic complexity. In addition,novel methods based on Hidalgo and Hausmann’s (2009) reflection method havebeen proposed (Hidalgo, 2021; Utkovski et al., 2018). Several researchers have com-pared existing economic complexity metrics (Albeaik et al., 2017; Hidalgo, 2021).However, the method proposed by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) is the most widelyused approach for measuring the ECIPrevious studies have focused on the determinants of the ECI from the perspectiveof factor endowments (Z. Wang & Wei, 2010), FDI (Antonietti & Franco, 2021), theglobal value chain division of labour (Dai & Jin, 2014), and spatial agglomeration(Balland et al., 2020; Malesky & Mosley, 2018; Storper, 2018). Z. Wang and Wei(2010) argue that human capital and the local government’s high-tech zone policypositively affect economic complexity. However, natural resources, foreign investment,and processing trade have a marginal impact on the ECI of Chinese cities. AntoniettiECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 1423and Franco (2021) find that the effect of inward FDI stock per capita on the ECIvaries by country. Dai and Jin (2014) show that the institution quality positivelyaffects the technical complexity of exports. Researchers have also addressed the deter-minants of the ECI based on geographical agglomeration. For example, Malesky andMosley (2018) claim that industry clustering boosts Chinese firms’ PCI. The agglom-eration economy is more prominent in industrialised nations than in emerging coun-tries (Thisse, 2018). Balland et al. (2020) find that regional characteristics influenceagglomeration effects. They argue that economic agglomeration improves the ECIbecause complex economic operations require greater in-depth knowledge and labourdivision. Klein and Crafts (2020) classify industrial clusters as specialised or diversi-fied. Storper (2018) examines the relationship between agglomeration economies andproduct complexity and finds that agglomeration externalities differ.The methods for measuring industrial agglomeration include location entropy (Mo& He, 2013), the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (Klein & Crafts, 2020), the space Ginicoefficient (X. Wang et al., 2021), the Ellison and Glaeser’s (E-G) index (Faggio et al.,2020), and the Duranton and Overman’s (DO) index (Duranton & Overman, 2005;Shao et al., 2018). Mo and He (2013) use location entropy to measure the degree ofagglomeration of high-tech industries in 25 Chinese provinces based on the industry’soutput value. Klein and Crafts (2020) employ the Herfindahl-Hirschman index andemployment data to observe the dynamic changes in the US manufacturing industryagglomeration from 1880 to 1930. X. Wang et al. (2021) use the space Gini coefficientand employment data to measure the agglomeration degree of modern services in 41cities in China’s Yangtze River 
Delta city group. Faggio et al. (2020) deploy employ-ment data from 97 three-digit industries in the UK and use the E-G index to measureindustry agglomeration. Others use the DO index based on the longitude and latitudeof firms to measure industrial agglomeration (Duranton & Overman, 2005; Shaoet al., 2018). The DO index is a metric for industrial agglomeration proposed byDuranton and Overman (2005). Researchers have developed various agglomerationmetrics depending on the research objectives and data acquired. Using the DO indexto measure AI industry agglomeration has numerous benefits. Based on the distancebetween firms, the DO index may better indicate the agglomeration of businesses(Shao et al., 2018). Unlike other agglomeration measurement approaches, the DOindex does not require prior area delimitation (Duranton & Overman, 2005) and maymeasure the entire continuous space, handling enterprise-scale distributionsmore flexibly.Existing research mainly focuses on the impact of AI on economic growth(Furman & Seamans, 2019), employment (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019; Frey &Osborne, 2017; Mutascu, 2021), corporate competition (Sun & Hou, 2021), and com-pany managerial efficiency (Di Vaio et al., 2020). Many studies have examined howfactor endowments, spatial agglomeration, the global value chain division of labour,and FDI affect product complexity. However, few studies have investigated the associ-ation between AI and the ECI. Moreover, AI helps companies become superstars,making it easy for AI companies to cluster. On the one hand, because AI is associatedwith higher fixed costs and lower marginal costs, companies using AI technologyhave higher barriers to entry. On the other hand, the platform economy is expected1424 Y. SHOUFU ET AL.to become a crucial economic model due to the significant impact of AI. The plat-form economy has cross-edge network externalities and may quickly become an oli-gopoly (Deng, 2021; Pavelkova et al., 2021). A significant gap is observed in the effectof AI industry agglomeration on the ECI. Hence, the action mechanism in the rela-tionship between AI industry agglomeration and the ECI needs to be furtherinvestigated.3. Theoretical background and hypotheses3.1. AI industry agglomeration and the ECIThe industrial agglomeration of traditional manufacturing and modern services hasbeen previously investigated (Klein & Crafts, 2020; Mo & He, 2013; Pavelkova et al.,2021; Shao et al., 2018). Previous studies have measured industrial agglomerationbased on employment, productivity, and output values. However, as AI is an emerg-ing industry, obtaining relevant data may be challenging. AI has played a vital role intransforming modern society and the economy, generating new waves of digitalisationand intelligence. All countries deploy AI and seek new regional competitive advan-tages to gain a future first-mover advantage (Furman & Seamans, 2019). Hence, anin-depth analysis of AI industry aggregation in terms of economic complexityis essential.AI industry agglomeration may increase the ECI in two ways. First, the develop-ment of AI may directly improve the ECI. As a critical technological innovation(Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019), AI may help businesses enhance manufacturing tech-nologies and produce items with higher technical content. These technologies mayuse network approaches to understand complex systems and improve technical prod-uct content by increasing dynamic data gathering and processing capabilities(Hidalgo, 2021). Second, AI may be regarded as a new factor of production(Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2017; Brynjolfsson et al., 2019), which may supplement exist-ing labour and assets (Goldfarb & Trefler, 2019), improve labour productivity(Brynjolfsson et al., 2019) and capital efficiency (Hidalgo, 2021), and help enhancethe total factor productivity (Brynjolfsson et al., 2019). Research shows that higherproductivity and capital efficiency lead to higher profitability (Sun & Hou, 2021).Therefore, adequate capital use allows companies to tolerate the uncertain costs oftechnological development and the fixed costs of exporting high-tech and complexproducts (Goldfarb & Trefler, 2019). This awareness encourages companies to focuson high-tech and complex products. Guan and Cheng (2020) show that companies’total factor productivity directly impacts the complexity of export technology. Hence,AI may positively affect the ECI by increasing total factor productivity. Third, thelower costs of AI-based industrial robots have helped them grow in popularity. Theuse of AI-related technology may improve labour quality. Industrial robots mayreplace low-wage workers such as drivers and waiters (Frank et al., 2019). Therefore,an enterprise’s low-wage labour demand decreases. However, industrial robots mayreintroduce labour into new tasks by changing task content. The creation effectoccurs when the popularity of industrial robots creates new jobs in coding, softwareand app development, and data backup (Graetz & Michaels, 2018). Creating new jobsECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 1425and occupations benefits the human capital of the job market. These dual effects mayenhance labour quality and increase the ECI.Agglomeration effects may directly promote ECI growth via a secondary influencepath. First, by leveraging the scale economy effect, AI firm clustering may help anarea or city develop more efficiently (Furman & Seamans, 2019). The concentrationof AI enterprises may induce several businesses to invest and relocate (Faggio et al.,2020; Pavelkova et al., 2021). Enterprise clustering may reduce transportation andknowledge acquisition costs (Klein & Crafts, 2020). In addition, the increasing returnsto scale may result in a pricing advantage, enhancing the company’s ability to com-pete in product export markets. Second, the AI industry is both knowledge- and cap-ital-intensive and is characterised by constant learning and technologicaladvancement. Knowledge and technology spillover from AI industry agglomerationbenefits the entire city (Pavelkova et al., 2021). The AI industry has grown rapidly inrecent decades. Several countries, including China, have promoted AI as a nationalstrategy (Xie et al., 2021). Most cities in China prioritise AI (Xie et al., 2021). Socialresources outnumber traditional industries, reducing the negative externalities ofindustrial agglomeration (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019; Klein & Crafts, 2020). As AIindustry agglomeration grows, the crowding effect is less likely to dominate (McCann& Van Oort, 2019). Hence, we propose the following hypothesis:H1: AI industry agglomeration has a positive effect on economic complexity.3.2. The mediating role of per capita human capital in the labour marketMarshall (2009) explains the agglomeration economy using the industrial district the-ory, acknowledging that externalities cause the geographic agglomeration of enter-prises. Marshall defines externalities in three ways. First, industrial agglomerationmay create a shared labour market. Second, industrial agglomeration may improveinput availability. Third, it may generate knowledge spillover. Hence, industrialagglomeration may generate externalities through people, goods, and knowledge.A labour market with higher per capita human capital helps form economies ofscale (Klein & Crafts, 2020; Pavelkova et al., 2021). Human capital has recently beenrecognised as an essential factor in enhancing corporate innovation capabilities(Furman & Seamans, 2019; Pavelkova et al., 2021), corporate total factor productivity(Pietrucha & _Zelazny, 2020), and company’s competitive advantages (Antonietti &Franco, 2021).In addition, according to product life cycle theory, human capital drives new prod-uct introduction and development (Lehmann et al., 2019). Human capital investmenthelps companies reduce the time of product development and improve the life cycleof earnings (Guan & Cheng, 2020). Increasing per capita human capital in the labourmarket help companies improve product diversification (Antonietti & Franco, 2021)and core technical strength (Deng, 2021), allowing them to develop new products orimprove the technical content of existing ones. Hence, we argue that improving theECI requires increasing per capita human capital in the labour market.AI industry agglomeration affects product technology content and the ECI, as dis-cussed in H1. In addition, top talent enhances technology, complex production1426 Y. SHOUFU ET AL.equipment, and knowledge-sharing opportunities. This strategy works best whenhigher levels of per capita human capital in the labour market support higheragglomeration levels (Liu & Tie, 2020).According to Marshall’s theory of industrial districts (Marshall, 2009) and Porter’stheory of industrial clusters (Porter, 2011), AI industry agglomeration improves theECI by gathering high-end talent. On the one hand, AI companies use industrialrobots or AI-related technology to replace low-end labour and create high-end labourpositions (Graetz & Michaels, 2018), increasing the demand for high-end talent. TheAI industry is knowledge-intensive and requires highly educated workers (Furman &Seamans, 2019). Therefore, AI firms need more high-end technical talent. The influxof high-end talent boosts the labour market’s per capita human capital and enhancesenterprise technological innovation capabilities, thus improving the ECI(Hidalgo, 2021).On the other hand, the AI industry’s agglomeration facilitates the development ofa labour market that shares different talents. A shared labour market facilitates talentflow within and between industries (Du & Vanino, 2021). It may save companiesmoney on high-end talent searches, better matching between AI companies and quali-fied job seekers. Finally, AI industry agglomeration may generate incentives todevelop more high-tech and complex products, helping increase the ECI. Hence, wepropose the following hypothesis:H2: Per capita human capital in the labour market mediates the effect of AI industryagglomeration on the ECI.3.3. The mediating role of intermediate input product qualityChanges in intermediate inputs may also affect productivity. First, a higher intermedi-ate input product quality requires more complex production technology (Amiti &Konings, 2007) and updated equipment (Halpern et al., 2015), thus increasing pro-duction efficiency. Second, the improvement in input positively affects output (Amiti& Konings, 2007). Hence, the quality of intermediate input products is linked to thecomplexity of final output goods. Finally, companies tend to improve their manage-ment to better utilise high-quality intermediate input products (Meng et al., 2020).Increased productivity allows a company to focus on high-complexity products.Improving intermediate input product quality may improve production efficiencythrough technology spillover (Liu & Tie, 2020). As a result, the quality of intermedi-ate input products may boost the ECI.As discussed in H1, we assume that AI industry agglomeration positively affectsproduct technology content and economic complexity. Improvements in the qualityof intermediate input products strengthen the productivity effect of economic spaceagglomeration (Defever et al., 2020). Hence, industrial agglomeration improves enter-prise productivity and increases productivity spillovers from improved intermediateinput product quality (Ciccone, 2002; Pavelkova et al., 2021).Based on the theory of industrial districts (Marshall, 2009), AI industry agglomer-ation may increase the ECI by sharing intermediate inputs. Marshall (2009) proposesthat industrial agglomeration increases access to specialised input services by sharingECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 1427intermediate inputs. As the AI industry agglomerates, the available intermediateinputs become more professional and the products more technical (Ciccone, 2002;Pavelkova et al., 2021). Hence, we propose the following hypothesis:H3: Intermediate input product quality mediates the effect of AI industry agglomerationon the ECI.3.4. The mediating role of innovation and entrepreneurship qualityInnovation and entrepreneurship generate new knowledge (Di Vaio et al., 2020), expandexisting knowledge (Di Vaio et al., 2020; Zhou & Li, 2012), and introduce new businessmodels (Foss & Saebi, 2017). They are common ways to improve company productivityand profits (Bergeaud et al., 2017; Brynjolfsson et al., 2019). The benefits of innovationand entrepreneurship are long-term (Nair, 2020), allowing companies to compete andgrow. Developing complex technologies may require years of knowledge accumulationand innovation (Antonietti & Franco, 2021; Mealy et al., 2019). Thus, we propose thatthe ECI positively relates to innovation and entrepreneurship.The AI industry may affect innovation and entrepreneurship in several ways. AIaids knowledge discovery and integration (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019; Brynjolfssonet al., 2019). Thus, the AI industry exhibits advancements in innovation and entrepre-neurship. Industrial agglomeration theory (Deng, 2021; Fan & Scott, 2009; Marshall,2009) suggests that increasing AI industry agglomeration may improve the quality ofinnovation and entrepreneurship.As discussed above, H1 discusses the positive relationship between AI industryagglomeration and the ECI. When high-quality innovation and entrepreneurship aresimultaneously backed by high AI company agglomeration (Deng, 2021), this patternmay fully use the agglomeration effect. AI industry agglomeration may improveinnovation quality and increase knowledge and technology spillovers. Therefore, wepropose the following hypothesis:H4: Innovation and entrepreneurship quality mediate the effect of AI industryagglomeration on the ECI.4. Data and methodology4.1. Data4.1.1. Economic complexity of the cityThe PCI and ECI may be measured in several ways. Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009)have introduced a reflection method to measure economic complexity based on acountry’s per capita GDP. This method has been used to develop novel economicand product complexity measures. Most researchers aim to improve measurementsthrough algorithms (Hidalgo, 2021; Tacchella et al., 2012; Utkovski et al., 2018).Tacchella et al. (2012) have proposed a novel nonlinear and iterative measure (FI) forproduct sophistication and country fitness. Utkovski et al. (2018) have proposed aprobabilistic learning framework based on Bayesian nonparametric techniques tomeasure product and country capabilities. However, with the significant change in1428 Y. SHOUFU ET AL.the social economy and production mode, some scholars have improved the previousmethods by focusing on the nature of the ECI (Ivanova et al., 2017). Ivanova et al.(2017) argue that capabilities may be endogenous to models of economic complexityand construct a framework that includes countries, product groups, and patentclasses. Some studies have compared the performance of ECI measurements as moremeasures have been proposed. Albeaik et al. (2017) have introduced a novel and sim-ple measure (ECIþ). They then compare ECIþ, the ECI provided by Hidalgo andHausmann (2009), and the FI proposed by Tacchella et al. (2012) to show thatECIþ outperforms the other two methods in estimating knowledge intensity andforecasting future economic growth. However, ECIþ has poor explanatory power andstrict data requirements (Albeaik et al., 2017). As mentioned above, the method ofreflection proposed by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) to measure the ECI has beenwidely used and accepted for several years (Hidalgo, 2021; Vu, 2022) and is equiva-lent to ECIþ and FI algorithmically. Therefore, this study adopts the method pro-posed by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) to measure the PCI.We use data from the UN Comtrade to calculate the PCI. Then, we calculate theECI at the city level by weighted summation of the PCI based on the city’s exportdata. The data on the trade export value of each city are obtained from the ChinaCustoms Data. We present detailed calculations below. The data cover 194 cities from2000 to 2016.We define a binary country-product matrix M with elements Mcp to create twomeasures: ubiquity and diversity. Mcp equals one if country c has a revealed compara-tive advantage (RCA) in producing product p, and zero otherwise. We measure RCAusing the Balassa Index (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009). When RCAcp  1, Mcp ¼ 1,
and Mcp ¼ 0 otherwise. Hence, we construct a matrix of countries and product M,Mcp, as follows:Mcp ¼1, RCAcp  10, RCAcp < 1:((1)After constructing matrix M, we obtain ubiquity (kp, 0) by summing the rows ofmatrix M, representing the number of countries producing a product. We obtaindiversity (kc, 0) by adding up the columns of matrix M, which represents the numberof products produced in a country:Ubiquity ¼ kp, 0 ¼XcMcp, (2)Diversity ¼ kc, 0 ¼XpMcp: (3)Following continuous iterations, we use the expressions Ubiquity and Diversity toperform mutual corrections to obtain a more refined measure of both attributes.Equations (4) and (5) are based on the expansion of Equations (2) and (3) andpresent the average ubiquity and diversity for all countries, respectively:ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 1429kp,N ¼ 1kp, 0XcMcp kc,N1: (4)kc,N ¼ 1kc, 0XpMcp kp,N1: (5)Substituting (4) into (5), we obtain:kp,N ¼Xp'Mpp' kp',N2, (6)where Mpp0 ¼PcMcpMcp0kc, 0kp, 0, p0 represents the products other than p, and N denotes thenumber of iterations.In the case of kp,N ¼ kp,N2 ¼ 1, Mpp0 is the eigenvector of Equation (6).However, this eigenvector only comprises values equal to one, which are not inform-ative when used to interpret the intrinsic trade abilities of the country. Therefore, weemploy the eigenvector with the second-greatest eigenvalue (Q!) to capture the largestproportion of the variance.Hence, we define product complexity for product p as follows:PCIp ¼Qp! hQ!istdevð QÞ! , (7)where h i refers to the average and stdev refers to the standard deviation. Finally, wecalculate the ECI at the city level (after the PCI). We use the city’s export value ofthe product as the weight to obtain the ECI of the city, as follows:ECIcity ¼XpPCIp  exportp, cityXpexportp, city, (8)where exportp, city is the export value of city c for exports of product p:4.1.2. AI industry agglomerationThis study uses the DO index proposed by Duranton and Overman (2005) to meas-ure AI industry agglomeration in various cities in China. Most studies have calculatedindustrial agglomeration based on China’s industrial enterprise data or economic cen-sus data (Mo & He, 2013; X. Wang et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2020). However, the AIindustry is emerging, and data on employment, output value, and productivity arescarce. Therefore, we use the DO index to measure the degree of AI industry agglom-eration in Chinese cities based on the longitude and latitude of AI enterprises. Inaddition, the data conventionally used for analysis may not accurately reflect theagglomeration and distribution of AI companies. Hence, this study uses a novel data-set of 2,503,795 AI enterprises in China and the web crawler technique to overcomethe above limitations. We obtain data from a corporate credit information enquiry1430 Y. SHOUFU ET AL.website in China, which provides information such as company name, exact address,industry type, registration time, and exit time. We limit the business scope of the AIindustry based on the Strategic Emerging Industry Classification issued by theNational Bureau of Statistics of China in 2018.The calculation of the DO index includes three steps. The first step estimates thekernel density function. For an AI industry with n establishments, we calculate theEuclidean distances for each pair of establishments. When an AI company is estab-lished, nðn1Þ2 different bilateral Euclidean distances may be calculated. However, bilat-eral Euclidean distances are only a rough estimation of the actual physical distancebetween AI companies due to errors (Duranton & Overman, 2005). To decrease thisnoise in the computation, we use a kernel-smooth method to estimate the distribu-tion of bilateral Euclidean distances.Let di, j be the Euclidean distance between AI company i and j: Assuming n AIenterprises within the AI industry, the estimated value of the bilateral distance density(K-density) at any point d is:dKAðdÞ ¼ 1n n 1ð ÞhXn1i¼1 Xnj¼iþ1 f ddijh , (9)where h refers to bandwidth, and f ð Þ is the Gaussian kernel function.Second, we construct counterfactuals. In line with Shao et al. (2018), we assumethat the location of all enterprises in China’s AI industry constitutes a set of possiblelocations for any company, and each company may randomly choose its locationfrom this set. In each simulation, we randomly select the same number of locationsas the number of enterprises to estimate the bilateral distance between these locationsand their K-density function. Following Duranton and Overman (2005) and Shaoet al. (2018), we conduct 1000 random simulations.Third, we calculate the local confidence intervals. Comparing the actual K-densityestimate with the K-density estimate of the simulated distribution determines whetheran industry is agglomerated. According to Duranton and Overman (2005) and Shaoet al. (2018), 40 km is the median distance between all the pairs of AI enterprises. Asthe local confidence interval only reflects the local information of industry agglomer-ation and dispersion at a certain distance, it cannot capture global agglomeration anddispersion (Duranton & Overman, 2005; Shao et al., 2018). Therefore, we focus onthe global confidence interval, a joint estimation of the local extreme values at mul-tiple distances (Duranton & Overman, 2005). We obtain a 95% global confidenceinterval by interpolating the local extreme values at multiple distances. Let KA ðdÞ bethe upper confidence band of the AI industry and KA (d) be the lower confidenceband of the AI industry. The AI industry is considered to have global localisation ata 5% confidence level if cKA dð Þ > KA ðdÞ for at least one d 2 0, 40½ : Similarly, whencKA dð Þ < KA ðdÞ for at least one d 2 0, 40½ , the AI industry is not localised, implyinga global dispersion. For the AI industry, the global localisation index is defined as:dAðdÞ ¼ max fcKA dð Þ  KA ðdÞ, 0g, (10)and the global dispersion index is:ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 1431wA dð Þ ¼max KA dð Þ  cKA dð Þ, 0n o , if Xd¼40d¼0 dA dð Þ ¼ 00, otherwise:8<: (11)Hence, we may calculate the DO index of AI industry agglomeration. The geo-graphical area of each city in China is different. To obtain the industrial agglomer-ation index of subsector A in city c, where A is a subsector of the AI industry, suchas AI manufacturing, AI information transmission, and the software and informationtechnology service industry, this study uses the agglomeration ratio method (Shaoet al., 2018) to eliminate the impact of the difference in the size of the geographicalarea, as follows:DOA, c ¼PdIddmax, (12)where Id ¼ 1, if cKA dð Þ> KA dð Þ,0, else(and d denotes the greatest distance. DOA, c isdefined as the agglomeration index of A subsector in City c:To compare the agglomeration of AI industries at the city level, we calculate theoverall AI industry agglomeration index by weighting the number of enterprises insubsector A of the AI industry in city c, as follows:Doc ¼PADOA, c  CountA, cPACountA, c, (13)where CountA, c is the number of companies in subsector A of the AI industry incity c:4.1.3. Control variablesWe control for four variables that potentially impact the ECI. Table 1 presents theirmeasurements and sources.The first variable is manufacturing development (Manu). The manufacturingindustry and export trade are strongly related. Advanced manufacturing directlyincreases regional product complexity. Following Filatotchev et al. (2011), we calcu-late Manu as the ratio of the number of employees in the manufacturing industry tothe number of employees in the region.The second control variable is financial development (Fin). External financing mayadjust the industry structure (Nguyen et al., 2020; Pavelkova et al., 2021) and providefinancial support for high-tech industries (Nguyen et al., 2020) through resource allo-cation, increasing the ECI. Following Filatotchev et al. (2011), we calculate Fin as theratio of the number of employees in the financial and insurance industries to thenumber of employees in the region.The third variable is FDI (FDI). FDI introduces foreign products and technologiesinto companies, causing technological spillover, and enhancing a company’s techno-logical R&D capabilities, thus increasing ECI. Following X. Wang et al. (2021), we1432 Y. SHOUFU ET AL.measure FDI by the regional amount of foreign capital used in the grossregional product.The last control variable is infrastructure (Infra). Infrastructure positively affectsthe complexity of high-tech products. An excellent infrastructure may save inventoryand production costs and reduce production uncertainty (Yuan et al., 2020).Following Yuan et al. (2020), we use the per capita area of paved roads in the city tomeasure Infra.4.1.4. MediatorsWe introduce three mediating variables. Table 1 summarises their measurements andsources. The first is the labour market’s human capital per capita (Labour). FollowingFilatotchev et al. (2011), we measure Labour using the proportion of the number ofcollege students in the labour market.The second is intermediate input product quality (Quality). We calculate Qualitybased on Defever et al. (2020). Due to the lack of data in Dazhou, Ordos, Tongliao,and Zhuzhou, and the lack of information regarding product unit prices in 2016 inChina Customs Data, we only examine the mediating effect of Quality in 190 Chinesecities from 2000 to 2015.The third mediator is the quality of innovation and entrepreneurship (Innovation).We employ China’s innovation and entrepreneurship index from the PekingUniversity Open Research Data Platform to measure Innovation.

Data for Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, andChongqing are missing; hence, we use data from 190 cities from 2000 to 2016 to ana-lyse the mediating effect of Innovation.4.2. Model specificationTo test the H1, this study employs the following panel regression model:ECIi, t ¼ a0 þ a1DOi, t þ uXi, t þ ui þ ut þ ei, t , (13)where t denotes the year ðt ¼ 2000, 2001, . . . . . . , 2016Þ, i is the number of cities(i ¼ 1, 2, . . . . . . , 194), and ECIi, t is the economic complexity of city i in year t, thecore dependent variable. Similarly, DOi, t denotes the level of AI industry agglomer-ation in city i in year t, and it is the core independent variable. a0 is the interceptterm. Xi, t represents the set of control variables, a1 and u are the estimated coeffi-cients on DOi, t and Xi, t respectively, ui and ut are a full set of city dummies andtime effects capturing the common shocks to the ECI of all cities, and ei, t denotes theerror term capturing all the other omitted factors.To evaluate the effect of mediators, following Yuan et al. (2020), we construct amediating effect model to test H2, H3, and H4, as follows.ECIi, t ¼ a0 þ a1DOi, t þ uXi, t þ ui þ ut þ e1i, t, (14)Mi, t ¼ b0 þ b1DOi, t þ uXi, t þ ki þ kt þ e2i, t , (15)ECIi, t ¼ c0 þ c1DOi, t þ c2Mi, t þ wXi, t þ xi þ xt þ e3i, t , (16)where M denotes a mediator, namely, Labour, Quality, or Innovation. Xi, t representsthe set of control variables, / and w are the estimated coefficients on Xi, t inEquations (15) and (16), respectively. b1 and c1 are the estimated coefficients onDOi, t in Equations (15) and (16), respectively, while c2 denotes the estimated coeffi-cients on mediators. In addition, b0 and c0 in Equations (15) and (16) are inter-preted in the same way as a0 in Equation (13), and k and x in Equations (15) and(16) are interpreted in the same way as u in Equation. (13). e3i, t and e3i, t are theerror term in Equations (15) and (16), respectively.5. Results5.1. Baseline regression analysisTable 2 reports the results of the baseline regressions. All models control for the fixedeffects of cities and years. Column (1) only considers DO. In Column (1), the esti-mated coefficient on DO is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level.Columns (2)–(5) add the control variables one by one; as the number of control vari-ables included in the model increases, the sign and significance of the estimated coef-ficient on DO exhibit no significant changes. The coefficient value shows an upward1434 Y. SHOUFU ET AL.trend, increasing from 0.0387 to 0.0435. The above results indicate that the agglomer-ation of China’s AI industry has a positive impact on the ECI. The agglomerationeffect generated by the AI industry is greater than the congestion effect; thus, H1 issupported. The increase in the ECI may be promoted by the clusters of China’s AIenterprises. The export product complexity and the city’s export value determine theeconomic complexity. Furthermore, the technological content of the export may beimproved by AI involving more complex technology and more demanding humancapital support.From the perspective of the control variables, the results of Model (5) indicatethat Manu, Fin, and Infra are statistically significant at the 1% level, and the coeffi-cients are positive. These results suggest that, first, manufacturing technologyupgrades and manufacturing scale expansions significantly affect economic com-plexity. China is regarded as a global factory due to its lower labour and land costs.The more workers in China’s manufacturing industry, the more competitive themanufacturing market. Hence, companies should be incentivised to increase R&Dinvestment and technical thresholds. The level of development of China’s manufac-turing industry directly determines the ECI, lending support to Lectard andRougier (2018).Second, the production of high-tech, high-value-added products requires consider-able capital, with significant uncertainty about the success of product research.Higher financial development level may improve the level of financing and the effi-ciency of resource allocation. Moreover, additional funds may reduce uncertainty inenterprise development and production. Therefore, financial development may sup-port the production of high-tech products, thereby increasing the ECI, in line withthe results of Malesky and Mosley (2018).Finally, high-tech industries and complex products require a complete infrastruc-ture due to the high degree of collaboration needed in the industry chain (Martın &Table 2.

Complete infrastructure construction may reduce corporate inven-tory and improve corporate logistics efficiency. Hence, companies could reduce pro-duction and transportation costs, which allows companies to have sufficient funds toproduce and develop high-tech and complex products to enhance the ECI, in linewith the results 
of Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009). The estimated coefficient on FDIis positive but not significant. This result is consistent with the conclusions of someprevious investigations (Lectard & Rougier, 2018) but does not support the findingsof Ozsoy et al. (2021). We suggest that foreign capital inflow may affect China’stechnological improvement in the short term. However, it is likely to restrain the pro-gress of China’s independent innovation capability in the long term, implying thatthe ECI is not affected by FDI.5.2. Analysis of heterogeneity of spatial agglomerationThe economic development conditions and development levels of various regions inChina differ substantially, so enterprises are affected differently by AI industryagglomeration across regions. Economic complexity exhibits substantial heterogeneityacross regions. Based on the classification standards of the National Bureau ofStatistics of China, the country is divided into eastern, central, and western regionsbased on economic development conditions and development levels. Beijing, Fujian,Guangdong, Hainan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanghai, Tianjin, andZhejiang provinces are the eastern regions; Anhui, Henan, Heilongjiang, Hubei,Hunan, Jilin, Jiangxi, and Shanxi provinces are the central regions; Chongqing,Guizhou, Gansu, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Inner MongoliaAutonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Tibet Autonomous Region,Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Qinghai, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan provin-ces are the western regions.Table 3 reports the regression results for the whole of China, as well as the eastern,central, and western regions. The estimated coefficient on DO in the western regionis not significant. AI industry agglomeration in the western region has almost noimpact on the ECI. We suggest that the western region lacks natural resources and ischaracterised by a remote location, backward economic development, severe braindrain, and limited development of the AI industry. Hence, the AI industry has notformed a significant agglomeration effect.However, the estimated coefficient on DO in the eastern and central regions is sig-nificantly positive, and the estimated coefficient in the central region is more signifi-cant than that in the eastern region. This result implies that AI industryagglomeration has a substantial and positive effect on the ECI in the eastern and cen-tral regions. Compared with the eastern region, the agglomeration of the central AIindustry has a more significant impact on the ECI. The cities in the eastern areaexperience congestion due to the overcrowded AI industrial cluster. As the clusteringof AI businesses continues, land and labour costs in the eastern area grow, and sev-eral industries relocate to the central and western regions. The central area has a dis-tinct geographical advantage, abundant natural resources, well-developedtransportation, competitive labour forces, and solid industrial foundations (Yuan1436 Y. SHOUFU ET AL.et al., 2020). Consequently, the central area plays an essential role in large-scaleindustrial transfer inside China, resulting in a complete industrial chain, whichimproves the ECI. As a result, the AI industry clustering in the central region resultsin robust economic dynamism.5.3. EndogeneityTheoretical research has shown a mutual influence between AI industry agglomer-ation and the ECI, generating potential endogeneity (Hidalgo, 2021; X. Wang et al.,2021). Endogeneity may stem from self-selection. Companies with high product com-plexity may automatically choose regions characterised by the net effect of highagglomeration in the AI industry (X. Wang et al., 2021). Second, AI industry agglom-eration may promote an increase in the ECI. However, cities with complex exportproducts usually have more developed high-end manufacturing and a more substan-tial R&D and innovation atmosphere. They are more attractive to high-end talents;hence, there may be a reverse causal relationship between AI industry agglomerationand the ECI. Endogeneity may lead to biased estimation results. To deal with possibleendogeneity, this study uses instrumental variable estimation.Angrist and Pischke (2010) have pointed out that a suitable instrumental variablemust simultaneously satisfy the relevance and exogeneity conditions. In other words,instrumental variables must explain the changes in the degree of agglomeration of theAI industry, but they cannot directly or indirectly affect the ECI through othermeans. In general, instrumental variables related to industrial agglomeration are basedon geographic or historical perspectives (Ciccone, 2002; Hidalgo, 2021). On the onehand, since some geographic indicators are naturally formed, and some historicalindicators refer to distant periods, they may better satisfy the exogeneity condition.Table 3.

In terms of geographic variables, following Baroneet al. (2015), this study employs the geographic slope of the city as the instrumentalvariable. We use the two-step optimal GMM for estimation.Model (1) in Table 4 includes the city’s geographic slope and population densityin 1984 as the instrumental variables. Model (2) in Table 4 includes the geographicslope of the city and the presence or absence of a railroad in the city in 1933.Overall, the results in Table 4 show that both the Kleibergen-Paap rk LM test andthe Cragg-Donald Wald F test reject the null hypothesis of insufficient and weakinstrumental variable identification, indicating satisfactory relevance.After considering endogeneity, the estimated coefficients on DO are all positiveand significant at the 1% level. When using the city’s geographic slope and popula-tion density in 1984 as instrumental variables, the estimated coefficient on DO is0.5255. When using the geographic slope of the city and the presence or absence of arailroad in the city in 1933 as instrumental variables, the estimated coefficient on DOis 0.7161. Both coefficients are significantly higher than that of the benchmark regres-sion (0.0435).Overall, after addressing endogeneity, the AI agglomeration significantly increasesthe ECI. Furthermore, the agglomeration effect is greater than that of the benchmarkregression. In other words, the positive externalities generated by China’s AI industryagglomeration are more significant than the negative externalities; hence, H1is supportedTable 4.

SHOUFU ET AL.5.4. Robustness analysisExisting studies have shown that the special administrative status of Chinese citiesmay exert administrative power on factor agglomeration and economic development,and the agglomeration effect of the AI industry is not comparable across municipal-ities, sub-provincial cities, and ordinary prefecture-level cities (J. Wang & Yeh, 2020).China has four first-tier cities and 15 sub-provincial cities (J. Wang & Yeh, 2020).Therefore, we analyse the different effects of AI industry agglomeration inthese contexts.First, we exclude four first-tier cities in China from the regression analysis. Wereport the empirical results in Column (2) of Table 5. Second, we exclude 15 sub-pro-vincial cities in China from the regression analysis, and the results are reported inColumn (3) of Table 5. Overall, the results show that the estimated coefficients on AIindustry agglomeration are positive and significant at 0.0442 and 0.0443, respectively,consistent with the benchmark regression results, further supporting H1.5.5. Mechanism testAccording to the above empirical results, DO significantly increases the ECI.However, the internal mechanism through which AI industry agglomeration pro-motes the ECI requires further investigation. Based on the industrial agglomerationexternality theory of (Marshall, 2009), we contend that AI industry agglomerationmay increase the ECI through people, goods, and knowledge.5.5.1. Mediating effect of the per capita human capital in the labour marketThe study’s results indicate that per capita human capital in the labour market medi-ates the relationship between AI industry agglomeration and the ECI.

In addition, the per capita human capital in the labour market is positivelyassociated with the ECI (see Model 3 in Table 6). The coefficient on AI industryagglomeration decreases when the per capita human capital in the labour market isconsidered in Model 3. Therefore, H2 is supported. The results show that the AIindustry clustering directly affects the ECI through per capita human capital in thelabour market. Increasing the degree of AI industry agglomeration promotes high-level talent gathering and low-end labour substitution (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019;Marshall, 2009), increasing the per capita human capital in the labour market.Clustering AI enterprises in certain cities may attract highly educated talent throughgreater economic development, higher salaries, and a better entrepreneurial environ-ment. As an agglomeration effect, gathering high-level talent may help enterprisesimprove their production capability and efficiency and develop new and high-techproducts. Moreover, cities with a more significant proportion of high-level labourersmay fully exploit the positive externalities of the AI industry agglomeration, thusdeveloping more products and producing more complex goods. Hence, the per capitahuman capital in the labour market is an essential path for AI industry agglomerationto increase the ECI.5.5.2. Mediating effect of intermediate input products qualityThe study’s results indicate that intermediate input product quality does not mediatethe relationship between AI industry agglomeration and the economic complexity ofthe city. AI industry agglomeration has no significant impact on intermediate inputproduct quality, as the coefficient on AI industry agglomeration is not statistically sig-nificant (see Model 2 in Table 7). However, the coefficient on AI industry agglomer-ation does not decrease (see Model 3 in Table 7). Thus, H3 is not supported. Thisresult contradicts Ellison et al. (2010).There may be several reasons why AI industry agglomeration does not affect inter-mediate input product quality. On the one hand, the clustering of AI companiescauses excessive competition in the intermediate product market. Enterprises squeezeTable 6.

SHOUFU ET AL.each other’s market space and potential and implement low-price competition strat-egies, significantly reducing their profit space. Hence, the R&D funds of enterpriseswill decrease due to fierce price competition. On the other hand, the agglomerationof AI companies may cause fierce competition in factors market. The agglomerationof AI companies has triggered a large-scale increase in demand for some productionfactors and a substantial increase in production factor costs, increasing the produc-tion costs. Thus, the enterprise’s production profit and funds for improving the qual-ity of the intermediate product are expected to decrease. Hence, the improvement inintermediate input product quality is not a channel for AI industry agglomeration topromote an increase in the ECI.5.5.3. Mediating effect of innovation and entrepreneurship qualityThe study’s results also show that innovation and entrepreneurship quality mediatethe relationship between AI industry agglomeration and the ECI. On the one hand,AI industry agglomeration is positively associated with innovation and entrepreneur-ship quality (see Model 2 in Table 8) and positively influences the ECI (see Model 1in Table 8). On the other hand, innovation and entrepreneurship quality are posi-tively associated with the economic complexity index (see Model 3 in Table 8). Thecoefficient on AI industry agglomeration decreases from 0.0442 to 0.0292 wheninnovation and entrepreneurship quality are included in Model 3. Thus, H4 is sup-ported. The results indicate that the AI industry clustering directly affects the ECI viainnovation and entrepreneurship quality. We contend that the clustering of AI enter-prises increases innovation and entrepreneurship quality for several reasons. First, theAI industry is knowledge- and technology-intensive, promoting local high-tech indus-tries’ development. Second, AI industry agglomeration generates knowledge and tech-nology spillover through information sharing and mutual learning. Finally, theclustering of AI enterprises may reduce R&D innovation costs. Hence, we suggestthat improving the agglomeration level of the AI industry enhances innovation andentrepreneurship quality. High-quality innovation allows enterprises to develop prod-ucts with unique, high value-added, and high technological complexity. This studyalso shows that AI industry agglomeration directly promotes the ECI (based on theTable 7.

Hence, improving innovation and entrepreneurship quality is a vitalchannel for AI industry agglomeration to promote the ECI.6. Discussion and conclusions6.1. ConclusionsThe integration of AI technology with other industries has deepened in China, recon-structing various economic activities such as production, distribution, exchange, andconsumption (Furman & Seamans, 2019; Martınez et al., 2022). Many studies haveanalysed the factors affecting the ECI from the perspectives of factor endowments (Z.Wang & Wei, 2010), FDI (Antonietti & Franco, 2021), the global value chain divis
