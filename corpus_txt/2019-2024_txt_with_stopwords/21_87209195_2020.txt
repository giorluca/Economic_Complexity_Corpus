RESEARCH ARTICLEEconomic complexity of prefectures in JapanAbhijit ChakrabortyID1,2,3*, Hiroyasu Inoue1, Yoshi Fujiwara11 Graduate School of Simulation Studies, The University of Hyogo, Kobe, Japan, 2 Advanced SystemsAnalysis, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Laxenburg, Austria, 3 ComplexityScience Hub Vienna, Vienna, Austria* abhiphyiitg@gmail.comAbstractEvery nation prioritizes the inclusive economic growth and development of all regions. How-ever, we observe that economic activities are clustered in space, which results in a disparityin per-capita income among different regions. A complexity-based method was proposed byHidalgo and Hausmann [PNAS 106, 10570-10575 (2009)] to explain the large gaps in per-capita income across countries. Although there have been extensive studies on countries’economic complexity using international export data, studies on economic complexity at theregional level are relatively less studied. Here, we study the industrial sector complexity ofprefectures in Japan based on the basic information of more than one million firms. Weaggregate the data as a bipartite network of prefectures and industrial sectors. We decom-pose the bipartite network as a prefecture-prefecture network and sector-sector network,which reveals the relationships among them. Similarities among the prefectures and amongthe sectors are measured using a metric. From these similarity matrices, we cluster the pre-fectures and sectors using the minimal spanning tree technique. The computed economiccomplexity index from the structure of the bipartite network shows a high correlation withmacroeconomic indicators, such as per-capita gross prefectural product and prefecturalincome per person. We argue that this index reflects the present economic performanceand hidden potential of the prefectures for future growth.IntroductionAn important characteristic of the economy is that economic activities are heterogeneouslydistributed over geographic locations. For example, the “blue banana” region, which stretchesfrom southeastern England through the Benelux countries, northern France and southwesternGermany to northeastern Italy, has a high level of income compared to other regions inEurope. Similar disparities in economic activity have also been observed at the national level.In Portugal, differences in development activities are observed between Lisbon and the northof the country and the center and the south of the country. Similar examples include Pariscompared to the rest of France, northeastern Spain and Madrid compare to the south and westparts of Spain, and the southern versus northern UK. Moreover, Japan also follows this trend.Japanese prefectures such as Tokyo and Osaka are much more developed than rural prefec-tures such as Akita and Kagoshima [1, 2].PLOS ONEPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017 August 27, 2020 1 / 13a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111OPEN ACCESSCitation: Chakraborty A, Inoue H, Fujiwara Y(2020) Economic complexity of prefectures inJapan.

The data are not inHidalgo and Hausmann proposed a complexity-based method to analyze the structuralproperties of bipartite world trade networks to explain large gaps in per-capita income acrosscountries [3, 4]. They quantitatively measured the complexity indices of the countries andtheir export products from the trade network, as these economic complexity indices are usefulfor explaining countries’ performance. In a recent work, Mealy et al. showed [5] that thecomplexity index is equivalent to a spectral clustering algorithm, which divides a similaritygraph into two parts. They have further shown that these indices are connected to variousdimensionality reduction methods. Subsequently, Tacchella et al. introduced the fitness-com-plexity algorithm [6] based on the conceptual framework of Hidalgo and Hausmann to calcu-late intangible properties such as the fitness of countries and the complexity of export productsfrom the structure of the world trade network. This method is very similar to the Google pagerank method for directed networks and applicable to bipartite networks. In this algorithm, thefixed point of coupled nonlinear maps provides the fitness of countries and the complexity ofproducts. The comparison of the complexity indices obtained by both methods [4, 6] withstandard monetary indices presents an indication for potential future growth.Economic complexity has traditionally been studied considering the structure of the bipar-tite world trade network [3, 4, 6–11]. Recently, economic complexity has been studied at theregional level for China [12], Brazil [10], Mexico [13], Italy [14], Spain [15], Australia [16], theUS and the UK [5]. Most of these regional complexity studies are done at very coarse grainlevel. In case of China, the analysis is performed for 31 provinces with 2690 firms, which is atiny fraction of all Chinese firms. The complexity analysis is performed at states level for Brazil,Mexico and Australia. The difference in our study is that it concerns supply-chain in whichprefectures and industrial sectors are studied. We are looking at process of value added startingfrom a giant network of firms and by aggregating as a binary bipartite network of prefecturesand industrial sectors. The investigation of the structure of bipartite networks of cities andtheir economic activities shows similarities with the nested ecological networks observed inmutualistic interactions between species [17]. These complexity methods have also been stud-ied in regard to ecological networks [18]. The quantification of complexity is found to be use-ful for ranking active and passive species in ecological networks.Japan has been one of the most diversified country in the sense of the products. Therefore,it is important to reveal that whether such diversity comes from regional structures. We useinformation about more than one million Japanese firms for this study. Similar Japanese firm-level data have been investigated in the past [19–25]. Past studies on these datasets mostlyaimed at uncovering the structure and dynamics of the supply chain network and bank-firmcredit network. However, the network that represents the interactions of firms with geographiclocations has not yet been holistically studied. Here, we uncover the industrial sector complex-ity of prefectures in Japan from the structure of the bipartite network of prefectures and theireconomic activities. The bipartite network is based on basic information of more than one mil-lion Japanese firms. Using the locations of the firms and Japan Standard Industrial Classifica-tion, we aggregate the data as a bipartite network of prefectures and industrial sectors. Themonopartite projection of the bipartite network presents a prefecture-prefecture network andsector-sector network. The similarities among prefectures and among industrial sectors aremeasured with these monopartite networks. Using the measured similarities, clusteringamong prefectures and sectors is shown with the minimal spanning trees (MSTs). By employ-ing the economic complexity framework, we calculate the economic complexity index (ECI)for the prefectures, which exhibit a high correlation with macroeconomic indicators, per-cap-ita gross prefectural product and prefectural income per person. Furthermore, we havechecked the robustness of the economic complexity results using the fitness complexitymethod [6].PLOS ONE Economic complexity of prefectures in JapanPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017 August 27, 2020 2 / 13the public domain, but are commercially available.Data access requests for the TSR Company ProfileData File can be directed to the Tokyo ShokoResearch, Ltd.

In the Data section, we provide the descrip-tions of the data. We explain the details of the methods in the Methods section. In the Resultssection, we present the results of our investigation, and in the Conclusions section, we presentour conclusions.DataOur data are based on a survey conducted by Tokyo Shoko Research (TSR), one of the leadingcredit research agencies in Tokyo, which was supplied to us by the Research Institute of Econ-omy, Trade and Industry (RIETI). We use “TSR Kigyo Jouhou” (firm information), whichcontains basic financial information on more than one million firms. The dataset was com-piled in July 2016. We only considered “active” firms that have information on employees andcurrent year sales. The dataset contains N = 1, 033, 518 firms. These firms constitute a giantweakly connected component in the Japanese production network [21]. The industrial sectorsare hierarchically categorized into 20 divisions, 99 major groups, 529 minor groups and 1, 455industries (Japan Standard Industrial Classification, November 2007, Revision 12). We aggre-gate the data as a bipartite network of prefectures (P = 47) and industrial sectors (S = 91). Weexclude some of the industrial sectors from the 99 major groups of the industrial sector classifi-cation, as these sectors skew the analysis in the following way: the excluded sectors are manu-facturers of petroleum and coal products, services incidental to the internet, financial producttransaction dealers and future commodity transaction dealers, professional services, advertis-ing services, and postal services. As these excluded sectors are only linked to Tokyo, the inclu-sion of these sectors in our analysis results in the largest value for the fitness of Tokyo, and thefitness of other prefectures become zero.The bipartite network is represented by the binary matrix Mps, where Mps = 1 if the indus-trial sector s has a significant amount of annual sales in prefecture p and 0 otherwise. TheRevealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) [26] is frequently used as a quantitative criterion toevaluate the relative dominance of a country, in the export of certain products by comparing itwith the average export of those products. Recently, RCA has been measured from the ratiobetween the actual number of firms from an industry in a province and the average number offirms from that industry in that province [12]. Mealy et al. constructed a binary region-indus-try matrix based on the number of people employed in an industry in a region [5]. Here, weuse annual sales of industrial sector s in prefecture p to measure the RCA, which is also a goodindicator of the performance of a industrial sector. An industrial sector s is said to have a sig-nificant amount of annual sales in prefecture p if its revealed comparative advantage (RCA) isgreater than or equal to unity.The RCA is defined asRCAps ¼wpsPswpsPpwpsPp;swps;where wps is the aggregated annual sales of industrial sector s in prefecture p.To explain the heterogeneity in prefectural economic activities, we have examined the rela-tionship between economic complexity and certain macroeconomic factors characterizing aprefectural economy. In particular, we find relationships between economic complexity andper-capita gross prefectural product and with prefectural income per person. The gross prefec-tural production is the total amount of value added produced in the prefecture and is calcu-lated by subtracting raw material costs and utility costs from the total amount of servicesPLOS ONE Economic complexity of prefectures in JapanPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017 August 27, 2020 3 / 13produced in the prefecture. Per-capita gross prefectural product is obtained by dividing theprefectural gross production by the prefectural population. Prefectural income is the sum ofemployee compensation, property income and business income. The prefectural income perperson is obtained by dividing the prefectural income by the prefectural population. We col-lected the gross prefectural product data, prefectural population data and prefectural incomeper person data for the year 2015 from the Japanese government statistical portal site (https://www.e-stat.go.jp).MethodsMethod for measuring economic complexityHidalgo and Hausmann introduced the idea of economic complexity for countries and prod-ucts that they export [3, 4]. Here, we apply the method to Japanese prefectures and their indus-trial sectors. The economic complexity index (ECI) of prefectures and product complexityindex (PCI) of industrial sectors can be calculated using the following iterative equation:kp;N ¼1kp;0XsMpsks;N 1 ð1Þks;N ¼1ks;0XpMpskp;N 1; ð2Þwhere kp,0 = ∑s Mps and ks,0 = ∑p Mps. In network terms, kp,1 and ks,1 are known as the averagenearest neighbor degree.Substituting Eq (2) into Eq (1) obtainskp;N ¼1kp;0XsMps1ks;0Xp0Mp0skp0 ;N 2 ð3Þkp;N ¼Xp0kp0 ;N 2XsMpsMp0skp;0ks;0¼Xp0gMpp0 kp0;N 2; ð4ÞwheregMpp0 ¼XsMpsMp0skp;0ks;0ð5ÞEq (4) is satisfied when kp,N = kp0, N−2 = 1, which is the eigenvector of gMpp0 associated withthe largest eigenvalue. Since this eigenvector is a vector with identical component values, it isnot informative. The eigenvector associated with the second largest eigenvalue captures thelargest amount of variance in the system. Therefore, we define the ECI as follows:ECI ¼~K  < ~K >stdevð~KÞ; ð6Þwhere ~K is the eigenvector of gMpp0 associated with the second largest eigenvalue. < ~K > andstdevð~KÞ indicate the mean and standard deviation of the components of the eigenvector ~K ,respectively.PLOS ONE Economic complexity of prefectures in JapanPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017 August 27, 2020 4 / 13To further understand the matrix elements gMpp0 , one can write Eq (5) in the following way:gMpp0 ¼XsMpskp;0Mp0sks;0¼XsPðsjpÞPðp0jsÞ ¼ Pðp0jpÞ; ð7Þwhere P(s|p) = Mps/kp,0 is the conditional probability that any industrial sector s is present in agiven prefecture p, and P(p0|s) = Mp0s/ks,0 is the conditional probability that a particular indus-trial sector s is present in any prefecture p0. From Eq (7), we can interpret gMpp0 as the condi-tional probability of reaching p0 from p through common industrial sectors.Similarly, one can calculate the product complexity index (PCI) from the eigenvector asso-ciated with the second largest eigenvalue of the matrix:gMss0 ¼XpMpsMps0kp;0ks;0: ð8ÞFitness-complexity algorithmBased on the conceptual framework of Hidalgo and Hausmann [3] and inspired by the Googlepage rank algorithm, Tacchella et al. introduced the fitness-complexity algorithm [6]. Thismethod has been studied extensively in regard to countries and their export products [9–11].Using this method, one can calculate the intangible properties such as the fitness of countriesand the complexity of products. Here, we use this method to study Japanese 
industrial sectorand prefecture relationships.This method is based on the following three ideas. (i) The fitness of a prefecture is measuredin terms of the diversity of the industrial sector set, weighted by the complexity of sectors. (ii)The more prefectures there are that have a particular industrial sector, the lower the complex-ity of the industrial sector. (iii) The upper bound of the complexity of an industrial sector mustbe dominated by the prefectures with the lowest fitness.The above facts are mathematically represented by the following self-consistent iterativecoupled equations with fitness Fp of prefectures and complexity Qs of industrial sectors:eF ðnÞp ¼XsMpsQðn 1Þs ;eQðnÞs ¼1PpMps1Fðn 1Þp;ð9Þwith normalization in each step: FðnÞp ¼~F ðnÞp<~F ðnÞp >; QðnÞs ¼~QðnÞs<~QðnÞs >: Here, n represents any arbitraryiteration step.The initial conditions are eQð0Þs ¼ eFð0Þp ¼ 1 for all p and s. The nature of the fixed point of theabove equations depends on the structure of Mps [27].We use the fitness-complexity method to check the robustness of the ECI for prefectures.ResultsBipartite network projection is a useful technique to compress information about bipartite net-works. The bipartite network of prefectures and industrial sectors can be decomposed into twonetworks, namely, the network of prefectures and the network of industrial sectors.PLOS ONE Economic complexity of prefectures in JapanPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017 August 27, 2020 5 / 13The network of prefecturesThe projection network of prefectures is represented by the (Np × Np) prefecture-prefecturematrix P = MMT. The nondiagonal element Ppp0 corresponds to the number of industrial sec-tors that prefecture p and p0 have in common. The diagonal element Ppp corresponds to thenumber of industrial sectors belonging to prefecture p and is a measure of the diversificationof prefecture p. To quantify the competition among two prefectures, we can define the similar-ity matrix among prefectures asYPpp0 ¼2� Ppp0Ppp þ Pp0p0;where 0 � YPpp0 � 1. The values of YPpp0 indicate a correlation between the industrial sectors ofprefectures p and p0.We have investigated the interrelation between the different prefectures by consideringhow similar they are in terms of their industrial sectors. The MST is a widely used method tovisualize the similarities between nodes. Given a set of nodes with a matrix specifying the simi-larity between them, the method of MST involves the following steps: (i) initially, an arbitrarynode is set as a tree; (ii) the tree is grown with a link that has maximum similarity; and (iii)step (ii) is repeated until all nodes are merged with the tree. We have shown the clustering ofprefectures by the MST in Fig 1. By visual inspection, we can observe that three different clus-ters on the tree consist of four prefectures of the Kanto, Chubu, and Kyushu regions. There isalso a cluster of four prefectures of the Tohoku region and Hokkaido. Moreover, we observevarious highly correlated pairs of geographically closely located prefectures, such as Ehime-Kochi, Niigata-Nagano, Okayama-Hiroshima, Mie-Wakayama, and Hyogo-Osaka. This find-ing indicates a strong similarity among the regional industries and also reflects the cooperativeand competitive nature of the regional industries in Japan.The network of industrial sectorsThe bipartite network can also be projected as a network of industrial sectors. Similar to theprefecture network, the industrial sector network is represented by the (Ns × Ns) sector-sectormatrix S = MTM. The nondiagonal element Sss0 corresponds to the number of prefectures hav-ing both sectors s and s0. The diagonal element Sss corresponds to the number of prefectureshaving sector s, which is a measure of the ubiquity of sector s. The similarity matrix among thesectors can be defined asYSss0 ¼2� Sss0Sss þ Ss0s0;where 0 � YSss0 � 1. YSss0 ¼ 1 indicates that whenever industrial sector s is present in a prefec-ture, industrial sector s0 is also present.Similar to prefectures, we show the clustering of industrial sectors using the MST in Fig 2.Most of the manufacturing industrial sectors, except for manufacturers of food, chemicalproducts, ceramic products, and information and communication electronics, form a singlecluster among themselves, which may indicate that one manufacturing industrial sectordepends on other manufacturing industrial sectors. We also observe a cluster of the construc-tion sector and a cluster consisting of agriculture, forestry, fisheries and manufacturers of foodindustrial sectors. However, other sectors are scattered on the tree, and clusters are formed bythe mixed composition of industrial sectors. For example, we observe that wholesale and retailtrade industrial divisions do not appear together; rather, they are scattered all over the tree.PLOS ONE Economic complexity of prefectures in JapanPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017 August 27, 2020 6 / 13This analysis shows how industrial sectors are geographically similar and also indicates whichindustrial sectors are complementary.Economic complexityWe quantitatively measure the economic complexity of prefectures in Japan using the methodof Hausmann and Hidalgo [3]. For the method details, see the Methods section. The industrialdiversification of a prefecture is represented by kp,0, and the ubiquity of its industrial sectors isindicated by kp,1. We show the location of the prefectures in the space defined by kp,0 and kp,1in Fig 3. kp,0 and kp,1 are slightly negatively correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r =−0.230 and p-value = 0.119), which indicate that many well diversified prefectures have ubiq-uitous industrial sectors. The two diversified prefectures, Tokyo and Osaka, have only lessubiquitous or highly specialized industrial sectors. Although Aichi is less diversified, it hashighly specialized industrial sectors. This result is in stark contrast to the results found in thebipartite trade network of countries and their export products [3] and in the regional eco-nomic complexity of China [12], where a strong negative correlation is observed betweenthese two quantities. The reported value of the Pearson correlation coefficient in the case ofChina’s regional complexity is r = −0.777, and the p-value is = 2.8 × 10−7 [12].The ECI is a quantitative measure of the complexity of a prefecture and a nonmonetary var-iable and can capture the economic development of a region [3, 4, 12]. For prefectures, we cancompare the ECI with macroeconomic variables such as per-capita gross prefectural productand prefectural income per person. We show the relationship between the ECI and per-capitagross prefectural product and prefectural income per person in Fig 4. The ECI has a strongpositive correlation with per-capita gross prefectural product (Pearson correlation coefficientr = 0.661 with a p-value = 4.2 × 10−7) and prefectural income per person (Pearson correlationFig 1. The MST for prefectures. The colors red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, orange, purple and light gray are used forthe Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kansai, Chugoku, Shikoku and Kyushu regions, respectively. The codes of theprefectures are listed in S1 Table of S1 Appendix. The eight regions of Japan are shown in a map using the same colorcode in S1 Fig of S1 Appendix.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017.g001PLOS ONE Economic complexity of prefectures in JapanPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017 August 27, 2020 7 / 13coefficient r = 0.668 with a p-value = 9.0 × 10−8). Following [28], we can argue that the correla-tion between the macroeconomic factors and the ECI is observed because income growth ratesare similar for prefectures with similar industrial sectors. An exponential fit to the data reflectsthe expected values of per-capita gross prefectural product and prefectural income per personat their level of economic complexity. The deviations in real per-capita gross prefectural prod-uct and prefectural income per person data from the expected values are informative and pro-vide an indication of the economic performance of the prefectures. Prefectures such as Osaka,Kanagawa, Hyogo, Fukuoka, and Okinawa, appearing below the expected values of per-capitagross prefectural product and prefectural income per person, may have the potential to morequickly grow in the future. An interpretation of the above results for the regions in Japan isgiven in the section “the average prefectural economic complexity of regions in Japan” of S1Appendix.Robustness of the ECI using the fitness-complexity algorithmTo check the robustness of the ECI, we compare it with the results obtained using the fitness-complexity method [6]. For detailed descriptions of the method, see the Methods section. Theconvergence properties of the algorithm depend on the structure of Mps [27]. We investigatethe triangular structure of binary matrix Mps by ordering the rows and columns according totheir fitness complexity rank. The structure of the ordered Mps in Fig 5(a) shows that the diag-onal line does not pass through the vacant region, which ensures that the fitness values of theFig 2. The MST for industrial sectors. Different colors represent nineteen divisions of industrial sectors. For example,red (ID: 9 to 31), light green (ID: 48 to 59), and brown (ID: 6 to 8) represent the manufacturing, wholesale and retail,and construction industrial sectors, respectively. The node IDs, sectors and divisions are given in S2 and S3 Tables ofS1 Appendix.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017.g002PLOS ONE Economic complexity of prefectures in JapanPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238017 August 27, 2020 8 / 13prefecture and complexity values of the industrial sectors will converge to nonzero fixed valueswith iterations [27]. We indeed observe that the evolution of the fitness values of the prefec-tures reaches fixed nonzero values with iterations, as shown in Fig 5(b).As seen from Fig 6, similar to the ECI, the fitness of the prefectures also shows a strong pos-itive correlation with the per-capita gross prefectural product (Pearson correlation coefficientr = 0.742 and a p-value = 2.3 × 10−9) and prefectural income per person (Pearson correlationcoefficient r = 0.746 and a p-value = 1.8 × 10−9). Here, we also observe that prefectures such asOsaka, Kanagawa, Hyogo, Fukuoka, and Okinawa appear below the expected values of theper-capita gross prefectural product and prefectural income per person. These prefectures mayhave the potential to more quickly grow in the future.The ECI method and fitness complexity method obtain quite similar results. Comparisonsof the ranking of the prefectures and industrial sectors by the two methods are listed in S2 andFig 3. Positions of the prefectures in the kp,0 − kp,1 plane.

The economic relation between prefectures shows that geograph-ically close prefectures are cooperative and competitive. The interrelationship betweenindustrial sectors shows the interdependence among them. The clustering of industrial sectorsFig 5. (a) Triangular structure of the ordered M matrix.

We have observed that most of the diversified Japanese prefec-tures have ubiquitous industrial sectors, which is very different from the case of China [12]and in the international trades of countries [3]. The economic complexity measured by thenonmonetary variables, ECI and fitness for the prefectures shows a high correlation with mac-roeconomic indicators, such as per-capita gross prefectural product and prefectural incomeper person. These nonmonetary variables are very useful for understanding the economicactivities in a prefecture. Our study will be helpful for understanding the economic health ofindustries in a region. We have studied economic complexity of prefectures in Japan based onthe binary bipartite matrix. In the future, it will be interesting to see if one gets more valuableinsights using a weighted matrix. Further studies on the dynamic evolution of economic com-plexity [29] in industrial sectors can predict the macroeconomic indicators for a prefecture.Supporting informationS1 Appendix.
