The model also incorporates other driversof CO2, such as technological innovation and economic growth. The current research utilizes datastretching from 1993 to 2018. The research employed Westerlund cointegration, fully modified OLS(FMOLS), dynamic OLS (DOLS), and method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) to evaluate theseinterconnections. The outcomes of the slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence affirmedthe use of second-generation techniques. The study confirmed the long-run association between CO2and the regressors. The results of the MMQR disclosed that in each quantile (0.1–0.90), renewableenergy enhances the quality of the environment, while economic complexity and nonrenewable energyintensify CO2. In addition, technological innovation enhances the quality of the environment from 0.1–0.70 quantiles, while from 0.80–90 quantiles, technological innovation intensifies CO2. The EKC is alsovalidated in each quantile (0.1–0.90). The DOLS, FE-OLS, and FMOLS outcomes also affirm the MMQRoutcomes. These outcomes encourage policymakers to implement holistic economic and environmentalpolicies that prioritize greener production processes for environmental reasons and meet the UnitedNations SDGs 7, 8, 13, and 17.© 2022 The Author(s).

IntroductionClimate change and global warming have been ongoing prob-lems facing governments, scholars, and policymakers since theearly 21st century (Vo and Vo, 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Yuanet al., 2020). Environmental contamination remains an imped-iment to the sustainable economic growth since it presents aplethora of environmental challenges, including energy depen-dence, deforestation, freshwater scarcity, climate change, and airpollution, all of which have been viewed as significant threats∗ Corresponding author at: Technological University Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.E-mail addresses: tadebayo@ciu.edu.tr (T.S.

As a result, the connection between the factorsthat are directly related to climate change must be re-examinedsince they can cause global devastation, endanger human exis-tence, and destroy the entire planet in various ways (Cao et al.,2019; Fan et al., 2020). Global warming is undoubtedly the mostdangerous externality ever seen in the history of mankind. Oneof the main factors causing pollution is greenhouse gas (GHGs)emissions (Ozturk and Acaravci, 2016). In this sense, CO2 emis-sions are regarded as the most significant source of GHGs, withCO2 accounting for roughly 76% GHGs emissions. Due to the sig-nificant expansion of the industrial sector in developed nations, itis reasonable to assume that ecological deterioration significantlyimpacts their economies (Shahzad et al., 2021).Increased worldwide awareness of ecological problems hasaided the coordination of international initiatives such as thehttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2022.09.1612352-4847/© 2022 The Author(s).

The main aims are to reduce globalemissions and provide countries with sustainable economic pros-perity. As a result, it is critical that immediate action is takenand effective remedies to minimize air pollution, avoid globalwarming, and combat climate variation are identified (Adebayoand Rjoub, 2021). Reducing the use of nonrenewable energy,which represents roughly 80% of global primary energy use andcontributes 75% of all GHG emissions with renewable, modern,and greener energy sources, such as tidal, geothermal, nuclear,biomass, solar, and the wind are the major aim of all countries(Acheampong et al., 2019; Doğan et al., 2021; Fatima et al., 2021).There is a consensus among the majority of researchers that usingrenewable energy resources significantly helps to reduce CO2emissions and safeguard the environment (Abbasi et al., 2021a;Adebayo, 2022a,b; Usman et al., 2020).The economic complexity index (ECI) measures how well acountry’s economy can export and create a diverse range ofgoods. It provides a structural assessment of interconnected net-work economies in relation to products, technology-intensiveexports, and the degree of productive consciousness embeddedin an economy (Abbasi et al., 2021b; Ahmed et al., 2021; Boletiet al., 2021). According to this viewpoint, contemporary economiccomplexity has increased the demand for energy sources, whichhas resulted in increased environmental pollution. On the onehand, increased ECI causes manufactured products to be morediversified and increases production levels, which contributesto global warming and climate change. On the other hand, ECIhas the potential to maintain ecological quality since it includesresearch and development (R&D) operations, as well as the ca-pacity to handle green technologies and environmentally-friendlyproducts (Shahzad et al., 2021).The EKC hypothesis serves as the theoretical framework forthis study. Economic growth can have three different conse-quences on the environment (Grossman and Krueger, 1991).Growth in the economy has three distinct impacts on CO2: thetechnique, composition, and scale effects. According to the scaleeffect, economic expansion causes ecological damage at firstbecause it obliges more resources and energy, leading to greaterpollution and waste. On the other hand, the amount of materi-als required and emissions generated in the production processare influenced by the nation’s structure (Hashmi et al., 2020).Furthermore, the composition effect implies that structural shiftsfrom the industrial to service sectors will curb the adverse ecolog-ical effects of growth. Finally, the technique effect suggests thatwhen there is an increase in a nation’s wealth, it clinches newand improved technology that increases output while curbingemissions.Apart from assessing the EKC theory, the interrelationshipsbetween disintegrated energy, economic complexity, technolog-ical innovation, and CO2 generated significant concern amongpolicymakers and central authorities when the sustainable de-velopment goals were publicized (SDGs) (Doğan et al., 2021). Inthis context, research on the energy-environment relationshipshows that energy use and economic expansion are two of themost important factors affecting CO2 emissions (Güngör et al.,2021). The UN’s position on energy management is stated in itsSustainable Development Goals; from its perspective, economiesthat are heavily dependent on nonrenewable energy sources arecausing serious climate change. As a result, increased investmentsin renewable energy sources such as wind, thermal power, andsolar are necessary to meet SDG 7 by 2030.The use of nonrenewables to meet energy demand is causingsubstantial problems in terms of regulating this situation. As aconsequence, the interrelationship between CO2 and GDP hasattracted significant attention in contemporary environmentaland energy economics (Adedapo et al., 2021; Shahbaz et al.,2015). More significantly, as stated by IEA, the energy sector isanticipated to produce over 68 percent of global GHG emissions,with fossil fuels accounting for approximately 44 percent of GHGemissions (IEA, 2022). This confirms that nonrenewable energysupplies are more likely to emit toxins into the ecosystem. Onthe flip side, renewable sources of energy, such as wind, hydro,tidal, and solar energy, can maintain the sustainability of theenvironment.Furthermore, some nations have undertaken well-known ini-tiatives to fight climate change and meet abatement objectives.Promoting technological innovation (TEC) has evolved as a com-monly acknowledged strategy for dealing with ecological chal-lenges, including CO2 in the chosen countries (Chen and Lee,2020; Khan et al., 2020). In reality, the number of patents issuedto the selected countries reflects an unprecedented increase inTEC. In light of the fast pace of technological advancement and itsconnected carbon reduction influence in the selected countries,scholars have assessed the TEC and CO2 emissions nexus forthe selected nations (Cheng et al., 2021; Rafique et al., 2021;Zhao et al., 2021b). With the help of TEC, renewable energysources can also be generated. REC capability is also being boostedthrough TEC, growing the likelihood that renewable energy willbe accessible to meet future energy demand. Due to the growingdemand for energy, it is widely assumed that REC will become themost significant energy in the future and will also be the mosteco-friendly. Based on the above discussion, the current paperassesses the effect of disintegrated energy (nonrenewable andrenewable energy) and technological innovation (TEC) on CO2 inthe top economic complexity nations.1The following are the study’s primary contributions: (1) In thisresearch, the association between TEC and CO2 in selected topeconomic complexity nations is systematically examined; this notonly presents a clear assessment of the effect of technological in-novation on CO2 in the selected top economic complexity nations,but it also provides additional facts for creating appropriate mea-sures to reduce CO2 and encourage TEC; (2) The present researchexamines whether EKC exists over the whole CO2 distribution;and (3) since adopting the right econometric technique is criti-cal for the outcomes’ credibility, this research assesses not onlyconditional means, but also controls distributional heterogeneityand uncovers the exogenous variables’ latent impacts across theconditional distribution of the endogenous variables. In doingso, we applied a novel method known as MMQR initiated by1 Japan, Switzerland, South Korea, Germany, Singapore, Austria and Czech.12833T.S. Adebayo, M. Altuntaş, S. Goyibnazarov et al. Energy Reports 8 (2022) 12832–12842Machado and Santos Silva (2019) to obtain more rigorous andrelevant heterogeneous panel outcomes. Since the distributionaleffect of the independent variables on the dependent variableis divided into multiple quantiles, the quantile regression makesmore sense. As a consequence, it is simpler to categorize the var-ious effects of diverse cross-sectional groupings. The informationprovided by conditional quantile estimations thus differs fromthat of conditional mean estimation. The findings of this researchwill thus aid decision-makers in developing practical strategiesto lessen the effects of economic complexity and disintegratedenergy on environmental deterioration.The subsequent sections are as follows: Sections 2 and 3present a summary of past studies and the methodology, respec-tively. Section 4 depicts the findings, while Section 5 presents theconclusion and policy suggestions.2. Literature reviewOver the years, significant studies have examined the fac-tors (economic growth, technological innovation, disintegratedenergy) influencing carbon emissions (CO2). Nevertheless, mixedfindings have been reported based on the technique(s) used,period of study, and countries/country of investigation (Donget al., 2021). For instance, Akadırı et al. (2021a), Akadiri et al.(2021b) explored the emissions-GDP interrelation using 28 Eu-ropean Union countries as a case study. The investigators utilizeda dataset from 1995–2015 and the DH causality approach and thestudy’s findings revealed that GDP triggers CO2 in the selected na-tions. Furthermore, Bekun and Agboola (2019) on the associationbetween GDP and CO2 using a dataset between 1990 and 2014uncovered that an expansion in GDP triggers CO2. Similarly, usingIndonesia and a dataset from 1965–2018, the study of Akinsolaet al. (2021) on the emissions-growth association reported apositive coherence between CO2 and real growth using the novelwavelet coherence. Similarly, He et al. (2021), in their researchusing Mexico and a dataset from 1990 to 2018, reported that anupsurge in GDP increased CO2. Likewise, the studies of Khan et al.(2021), Zhao et al. (2021a,b), and Dong et al. (2020) also reportedthat an increase in GDP causes a surge in CO2. Furthermore, theresearch of Kihombo et al. (2021a,b) on the drivers of CO2 inWEMA nations using a dataset between 1990 and 2018 disclosedthat an expansion in GDP causes an increase in CO2.Recently, economic complexity (ECI) has been found to have asubstantial 
effect on CO2. ECI is a broad measure of a nation’s size,structural changes, and technological advancement. The studyof Can and Gozgor (2016) on the effect of ECI on CO2 for thecase of France using a dataset from 1964–2011 reported thatan upsurge in ECI contributes to a decrease of CO2 in Franceusing ARDL. Similarly, Romero and Gramkow (2021) assessed theinterconnectedness between GHGs emission and ECI and theirresearch disclosed that an upsurge in ECI abate GHGs emissions.Similarly, Doğan et al. (2021), in their research on the driversof CO2 in 55 nations between 1971 and 2014, unveiled that ECIupsurges CO2 using the quantile regression technique. Likewise,using a dataset from 1995–2017 in 25 selected European Union,Neagu (2020) studied the influence of ECI on CO2 using CPRregression. The study finding disclosed that the decrease in CO2is caused by an upsurge in ECI in the nations selected. Moreover,Khezri et al. (2022) study on the ECI-emissions linkage in 29 Asia-Pacific nations using a dataset from 2000–2018 and their studyfinding disclosed that an upsurge in ECI causes increased CO2and economic expansion. Likewise, the research of Doğan et al.(2021) on the ECI-emissions nexus reported that lessening in CO2is caused by 1% intensification in ECI.Energy is the heartbeat of economic activities; however, itseffect may harm the environment if its consumption is not sus-tainable. Studies on the disintegration energy effect on CO2 arevast; however, the study’s outcomes are inconclusive. For in-stance, Oladipupo et al. (2021) assessed the effect of disintegra-tion energy on CO2 in Portugal using a quarterly dataset from1980–2018. The novel wavelet was used and the study findingsdisclosed that nonrenewable energy (NREC) triggers CO2 whilerenewable energy (REC) diminishes CO2. In the same vein, thework of Cheng et al. (2021) on the disintegrated energy and CO2in China using a dataset from 1980–2014 disclosed that NRECtriggers CO2 while REC abates CO2.Similarly, Inglesi-Lotz and Dogan (2018) assessed the driversof CO2 using a dataset from 1980–2011. The investigators’ utilizedpanel ARDL and the study findings unleashed that NREC causedan increase in CO2 while REC caused a decrease in CO2. Moreover,the research of Dogan and Ozturk (2017) reported that NREC andREC increase and decrease CO2 emissions, respectively using adataset from 1990 to 2014 and AMG estimator.Since ecological issues are so important, significant scholarshave assessed the consequences of technological innovation (TI)on CO2. TI is identified to have a significant impact on CO2mitigation. In host nations, TI has decreased CO2 and improvedthe quality of the environment by combining it with ecologicalprotection measures. Numerous research has looked at the rela-tionship between CO2 and TI; nonetheless, mixed results surfaced.For instance, Adebayo and Kirikkaleli (2021) examined the CO2-TIinterconnectedness for the global economy case using a datasetbetween 1990 and 2018. The authors’ used FMOLS and DOLS, andtheir findings disclosed that TI helps mitigate CO2. Similarly, theresearch of Kihombo et al. (2021b) also reported that TI aid indiminishing the level of CO2. Moreover, the research of Chenget al. (2021) in China testified that TI plays a significant role indwindling CO2 levels in China. Similarly, the research of Lin andZhu (2019) on the CO2-TI nexus unveiled that TI curbs CO2.In light of the investigations summarized above, the followingviewpoints came to light: The techniques commonly used inthe reviewed literature regarding the connection between dis-integrated energy consumption and economic complexity andenvironmental degradation are vector autoregressive (VAR), au-toregressive distributed lag (ARDL), Toda-Yamamoto causality,ordinary least squares, panel ARDL and vector error correctionmodel (Akadiri et al., 2022; Altarhouni et al., 2021; Kirikkaleliand Oyebanji, 2022; Olanrewaju et al., 2022; Samour et al., 2022;Shan et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022). More specifically, Adebayoet al. (2022) used the NICs to evaluate the effect of fossil fuel andrenewable energy on environmental degradation, while Awosusiet al. (2022) scrutinized the effect of energy (renewable and non-renewable) on environmental sustainability. Moreover, Alola et al.(2021) used a quantile approach to evaluate the nexus betweendisintegrated energy and environmental deterioration. In sum-mary, no empirical research has thus far been done utilizing thenovel MMQR in top-economic complexity countries to investigatethese relationships. As a result, this work is the first attemptto address research gaps using the MMQR technique to inves-tigate the correlation between disintegrated energy, economiccomplexity, and environmental deterioration.3. Theoretical underpinning, data, and methodology3.1. Theoretical underpinningThe EKC theory serves as the theoretical framework for thisstudy. Economic expansion can have three different consequenceson the environment. Growth in the economy has three dissimilarimpacts on CO2: the technique, composition, and scale effects.According to the scale effect, Growth in the economy causesecological damage at first since it obliges more resources andenergy, culminating in larger pollution and waste. On the flip side,12834T.S. Adebayo, M. Altuntaş, S. Goyibnazarov et al. Energy Reports 8 (2022) 12832–12842the amount of materials required and emissions generated in theproduction process are influenced by the structure of a country.Furthermore, the composition phase implies that shifts in theindustry to service sectors will abate the destructive ecologicaleffects of GDP growth. Finally, the technique suggests that an up-surge in a nation’s wealth enables it to adopt new and improvedtechnology that increases output while curbing emissions.Another critical aspect that may influence environmental qual-ity is economic complexity (ECI). ECI is a broad measurementof a nation’s size, structural changes, and technological advance-ment. Nonetheless, an economy’s complexity may aid govern-ments in managing skills, technological innovation, and knowl-edge, encouraging greener goods and eco-friendly technology,resulting in less environmental harm. On the other hand, sim-ple economies cannot manage efficient knowledge; as a result,commodities are created using nonrenewable energy sources andtraditional technology. As a result, nonrenewable energy andoutdated technologies have detrimental environmental effects.Renewable energy (REC) is the purest form of energy ac-cessible and produces no contamination or depletion of naturalresources; therefore, its usage reduces the environmental impact.Wind, hydro and solar power are the most environmentally-friendly energy sources. REC, contrary to fossil fuels, has no limit.On the flip side, nonrenewable energy sources are finite and un-maintainable, and their extensive use exacerbates global warmingand climate change by raising GHGs. This implies that utilizingNREC energy surges CO2, but utilizing REC decreases emissions.It is widely acknowledged that TEC has a significant influenceon CO2 mitigation. Due to the combination of TEC with envi-ronmental conservation measures, CO2 levels have been reduced.TEC is crucial in lowering CO2 while still helping to conserveenergy. Furthermore, TEC is essential for the most efficient usageof conventional and renewable energy sources. With the help ofTEC, renewable energy sources can also be generated. Renewableenergy capacity is also being boosted through TEC, increasingthe likelihood that renewable energy will be accessible to meetfuture energy demand. Due to the growing demand for energy,it is widely assumed that REC will become the most significantenergy source in the future and that it will also be the mostenvironmentally friendly. The current study is built on the studyof Rafique et al. (2021) by incorporating technological innovation.The economic model is illustrated as follows:C02i,t = α0 + θ1GDPi,t + θ2GDPSQi,t + θ3ECIi,t+ θ4RECi,t + θ5NRECi,t + θ6TIi,t + εi,t (1)where ‘‘i’’, and ‘‘t’’ signifies the cross-section and period of re-search (1993–2018). Also, θ ′s and ε denote parameters and errorterms. CO2, GDP, REC, ECI, NREC and TI stand for CO2 emis-sions, economic growth, renewable energy, economic complexity,nonrenewable energy, and technological innovation.3.2. DataThe current investigation used yearly data for the top eco-nomic complexity nation to evaluate the effect of disintegratedenergy and economic complexity on environmental degradation.The data set for this empirical investigation covers between 1993and 2018. The unavailability of data on economic complexitylimit this study to 2018. The dependent variable is CO2 emis-sions, while the exogenous variables are economic complexity,economic growth, technological innovation, renewable and non-renewable energy consumption. The variables utilized in thisanalysis are converted into natural logarithms to lessen skewnessand assure normal distribution. Table 1 presents informationregarding the variables used. The flow of analysis is depicted inFig. 1.3.3. Techniques employedThe FE-OLS is a modification over Driscoll and Kraay stan-dard errors initiated by Driscoll and Kraay (1998). Furthermore,heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependency, and autocorrelationare not a problem for this statistical procedure. To solve theheterogeneity dilemma, the mean difference within variations,cross-sections, and the panel structure of dynamic cointegra-tion is changed to cointegrate equilibrium. According to Pedroni(2004), the FM-OLS is sufficient to resolve these issues. Comparedto other estimation techniques, even with the sample population,it is evident that it is unbiased. Endogeneity may be managedusing D-OLS by using lead and lagged differences. At first, Bassettand Koenker (1978) suggested a panel quantile regression model.The dependent conditional and variance mean are calculatedusing this regression with respect to the values of the explanatorycomponents. Quantile regression offers more trustworthy resultseven when the data contains outliers. As a consequence, weapplied the MMQR technique Machado and Santos Silva (2019).This statistical technique was created to evaluate several quan-tiles’ heterogeneous and distributional effects. The scale-locationvariant conditional quantile estimates Qy(τ |X) are depicted inEq. (2).Yit = αi + X ′ itβ +(δi + Z ′ itΥ)Uit (2)where the probability and parameters P {δI + Z ′ itΥ > 0 = 1}. (α,β ′, δ, Υ ′) are to be estimated. Additionally, i illustrates fixed anddiscrete effects are shown by (αi, δi), i = 1, . . . , n, and k-vector ofrecognized portions of X is shown by Z which are differentiablechanges with part l depicted in Eq. (3):Zl = Zl (X) , l = 1, . . . , k (3)where; Xit is proportionately and independently dispersed acrosstime t and fixed I. Similarly, the distributed fixed cross-sectionsand across time is depicted by Uit , and it is orthogonal to Xit(Machado and Santos Silva, 2019). On the flip side, the remainingparts do not exhibit rigorous exogenous behavior as shown inEq. (4):Qy(τ |Xit ) = (αi + δiq(τ )) + X ′ itβ + Z ′ itΥ q(τ ) (4)Xit denotes the vectors of the regressors. The dependentvariable quantile distribution is shown by Yit (For instance CO2)is illustrated by Qy(τ |Xit ), which is shown as conditional on theexogenous variable location and X ′ it . –αi (τ ) ≡ αi + δiq(τ ) isthe scaler coefficient which denotes the quantile fixed effect τfor an individual i. Unlike other least-square fixed effects, theindividual effect does not have an intercept shift. Heterogeneousimpacts are susceptible to change and conditional distribution ineach quantile since the indicators are time invariant. q(τ ) showsthe τ − th sample quantiles that are examined by assessing thesubsequent optimization issue as shown in Eq.

Findings and discussionIn brief, this study’s assessment strategies are divided into fiveparts: (1) This research first establishes the slope heterogeneity12835T.S. Adebayo, M. Altuntaş, S.

Flow of the study.(SH) and presence of CD in the panel data; (2) the stationarityattributes of the study’s indicators are checked by utilizing theCIPS and CADF unit root tests. (3) We assess the influence ofdisintegrated energy use (renewable and nonrenewable), tech-nological innovation, economic complexity and economic growthon CO2 emissions using long-run estimators (DOLS, FE-OLS andFMOLS); (4) We assess the effect of the aforementioned indepen-dent variables on CO2 emissions using the novel MMQR; and (v)We assess the casual interconnection between CO2 and disinte-grated energy use (renewable and nonrenewable), technologicalinnovation, economic complexity and economic growth.4.1. Cross-sectional dependence (CD) and slope heterogeneity out-comesAs globalization progresses, considerable interconnectednessbetween nations have emerged as a result of their economiccooperation (Shahbaz et al., 2015). It is crucial to mention thatneglecting the CD might result in erratic and incorrect results.As a result, examining CD within the sample data is necessarybefore doing an econometric approximation. To measure CD,four-CD tests are performed. Table 2 summarizes the findings ofthe various CD tests. The tests’ p-values are significant at the1% level, indicating that the null hypothesis is firmly rejected(i.e., CD exists within the panel data). This necessitates consid-ering CD while further empirical analyse are conducted. We alsolook at the slope coefficient heterogeneity. The Hashem Pesaranand Yamagata (2008) slope coefficient heterogeneity test wasused in this case, with the estimated results shown in Table 3.The empirical findings show that the adjusted SH and SH aresignificant at the 1% level. As a result, the SH test estimatesreject the null hypothesis that the slopes are homogeneous. Asa result, the slope coefficients of the selected panel are found tobe heterogeneous. As previously noted, various factors (such asglobalization, trade, etc.) enhance the dependence of one nationon another. Globalization and Trade liberalization, on the otherhand, is critical to achieving a variety of economic, environmentaland financial goals.4.2. Unit root outcomesThe stationarity of data is vital in empirical research sinceit refers to using an efficient estimator for short-run/long-runanalysis. As a result, after examining the SH and CD, we soughtthe existence of a unit root in the data. The CIPS and CADF unitroot tests were used in this case, and the results are disclosedin Table 4. The outcomes uncovered that all the investigationindicators are I(1).4.3. Cointegration outcomesAfter establishing the stationarity properties of the variables,we examine the long-run interrelationship between CO2 and theexogenous variables (ECI, TEC, GDP, REC, and NREC). In doingso, it is necessary to use a cointegration test that considers SHand CD. Therefore, we used the Westerlund cointegration test.Table 5 reports the cointegration test outcomes. Based on theseoutcomes, the null hypothesis of ‘‘no cointegration’’ is refuted.Therefore, in the long run, there is an interrelationship betweenCO2 and the exogenous variables.12836T.S. Adebayo, M.

Long-run outcomesThe current paper proceeds by assessing the effect of GDP,ECI, TEC, REC and NREC on CO2 utilizing long-run estimators(FMOLS, DOLS and FE-OLS). Table 6 reports the DOLS, FE-OLS andFMOLS outcomes. The influence of GDP on CO2 is found to bepositive. This demonstrates that holding other factors constant,a 1% upsurge in GDP increases CO2 by 2.70% (FMOLS), 2.10%(DOLS) and 3.20% (FE-OLS),. Furthermore, we found a negativeeffect of GDPSQ on CO2. This demonstrates that a 1% upsurgein GDPSQ mitigates CO2 by 0.55% (FMOLS), 0.38% (DOLS) and0.78% (FE-OLS). Moreover, a negative association was observedregarding the connection between CO2 and NREC. This illustratesthat increases of 0.25% (FMOLS), 0.31% (DOLS) and 0.43% (FE-OLS) in CO2 are caused by a 1% upsurge in NREC, keeping otherfactors constant. Furthermore, we established a positive ECI andCO2 interconnection. This indicates that a 1% upsurge in ECIaccelerates CO2 by 0.10% (FMOLS), 0.20% (DOLS) and 0.14% (FE-OLS). Moreover, TEC impacts CO2 negatively, as disclosed by thelong-run estimators. This indicates that holding other indicatorsconstant, a 1% upsurge in TEC mitigates CO2 by 0.048% (FMOLS),0.05% (DOLS) and 0.03% (FE-OLS), respectively. Lastly, we uncov-ered a negative REC-CO2 interconnectedness. This implies that a1% upsurge in REC decreases CO2 by −0.04% (FMOLS), −0.05%(DOLS) and −0.03% (FE-OLS).4.5. MMQR outcomesWe explored the influence of ECI, GDP, TEC, NREC and NRECon CO2 in the top economic complex nations in each quantile.In doing so, the MMQR was applied to assess these interrela-tionships (See Table 7). In each quantile (0.1–0.90), we observedthat GDP impact CO2 emissions positively. This demonstratesthat GDP accelerates CO2 (0.1–0.90) across all quantiles. Primaryoutput rises slowly in the early stages of economic expansionand accelerates in the later stages. As a result, an increase inthese economic activities has a positive impact on CO2. For allquantiles, however, GDPSQ has an adverse impact on CO2. Like-wise, even if the turning point varies between quantiles, theEKC hypothesis can be confirmed for all quantiles (0.1–0.90). Inthe top economic complexity economies, the legitimacy of theEKC indicates that these nations have reached a specific degreeof economic expansion. Therefore, it is now necessary to shiftto more environmentally-friendly economic expansion (Apinranet al., 2021). Economic growth appears to increase CO2 at first,until it hits a peak, after which it begins to improve environ-mental quality. This is achievable thanks to strict environmentalregulations and consumer pressure from high-income customers.Furthermore, increased economic expansion encourages techno-logical advancements, supports alternative energy and renewableenergy sources for manufacturing, and develops the service andtertiary sectors, all of which contribute to reducing CO2. Thestudies of Kirikkaleli and Adebayo (2021), Shahzad et al. (2022),Akadırı et al. (2021a), Akadiri et al. (2021b) and Bekun et al.(2019) also reported similar findings.Moreover, we found a positive NREC-CO2 interconnectednessacross all quantiles (0.1–0.90). This establishes that in each quan-tile (0.1–0.90), NREC contributes to the CO2 upsurge in the se-lected nations. Furthermore, NREC increases as we move towardsthe higher quantiles. This means that the current energy poli-cies in the selected countries must be closely monitored. Thesecountries are significantly reliant on nonrenewable energy toattain faster economic expansion: to meet the increased energydemand, these countries use copious amounts of nonrenewableenergy and fossil fuels. This could be because present renewableenergy sources are not sufficiently strong to provide all of theenergy demands for economic activities (Oladipupo et al., 2021;Rafique et al., 2021; Soylu et al., 2021). In such circumstances, theresults of this study may be useful for policy initiatives, since theyassist in achieving several of the SDGs. Importantly, the govern-ments of these countries may aid organizations and businessesin their efforts to discover cleaner and renewable energy sources,as well as technological development, as an alternative to fossilfuel usage. Such initiatives may aid in the production of clean andaffordable energy, thus contributing to the attainment of SDG 7.We also found an adverse association between REC and CO2across all quantiles (0.1–0.90). This demonstrates that across allquantiles (0.1–0.90), REC abates CO2. In addition, as we movetowards the upper quantiles, the magnitude of reduction in CO2caused by REC increases. REC eliminates emissions and thus, hasthe power to benefit the environment by making it cleaner. Asa result, climate change mitigation efforts should prioritize REC,which is environmentally favorable. The studies of Adebayo andRjoub (2021) and Lin and Zhu (2019) on the renewable energy-emissions nexus in the global economy and Portugal reportedsimilar findings. Nonetheless, the research of Alola et al. (2021)in China on the renewable energy-emissions association reported12837T.S. Adebayo, M. Altuntaş, S. Goyibnazarov et al.

Though renewable energyis advantageous, its adverse effects must not be overlooked. Forexample, installing most renewable energy sources is expensive.The weather has a significant impact on sources like solar cellsand wind turbines as well. Wind turbines will not turn if there isno wind and Solar cells will not generate much electricity if it iscloudy. Furthermore, wind farms change the direction of windsand cause birds’ death. Moreover, hydro dams, if not properlymaintained, can cause floods. Therefore, strong policies must beput on the ground to curb such occurrences.Moreover, we established a positive ECI and CO2 interrelation-ship for the selected nations. In addition, we noticed a decreasein the magnitude of the coefficient as we moved towards theupper quantiles. More precisely, the results indicate that there isa necessity to move ECI to a level of resource utilization effec-tiveness and efficiency, where sophisticated goods use advancedand highly efficient technologies. This outcome complies withprior studies (Abbasi et al., 2021b; Akadırı et al., 2021a; Akadiriet al., 2021b; Khezri et al., 2022; Neagu, 2020). This finding alsolends credence to the notion that complex productive systemspotentially damage the environment’s quality. The outcomes ofECI for the selected countries are particularly interesting, sug-gesting that a productive structure influences energy use policiesand increased consumption of nonrenewables lead to increasedglobal emissions. Moreover, the positive ECI-CO2 interconnectionmay be ascribed to the fact that outmoded technologies influenceeconomic productivity, and thus, increase energy intensity anddemand.Also, we established a negative CO2-TEC association in eachquantile (0.1–0.90). This demonstrates that across quantile (0.1–0.90), TEC abate CO2. In addition, as we move towards the highertail, the TEC’s coefficient’s magnitude diminishes. This outcomealigns with the studies of Adebayo and Rjoub (2021) and Kihomboet al. (2021a,b), who reported a negative CO2-TEC interconnec-tion. In other words, encouraging TEC can help abate CO2. Boost-ing a nation’s level of TEC, in particular, will have considerablespillover and propelling impacts on its rapid development. Onthe other hand, TEC is probable to save a substantial amountof energy, minimize fossil energy use, and enhance the energyefficiency, therefore facilitating the goal of lowering CO2. Further-more, the comparison of the FE-OLS, FMOLS, DOLS and MMQR ispresented in Fig. 2. Lastly, the summary of findings from FE-OLS,FMOLS, DOLS and MMQR is shown in Fig. 3.Table 8DH causality tests.Causality path W-Stat.

Panel causality outcomesThe present research also assessed the causal effect of ECI,NREC, REC, TEC and GDP on CO2 in top economic complexity na-tions. Table 8 reports the causal associations’ outcomes. Findingsunveiled a one-way causal association from REC to CO2 at a 1%level of significance. Moreover, a unidirectional causal associationwas establised, running from TEC to CO2at a 1% significance level.Furthermore, a feedback causal association exists between GDPand CO2, suggesting that both REC and GDP can significantlypredict each other. In addition, feedback causality exists betweenNREC and CO2, demonstrating that both CO2 and NREC can sig-nificantly predict one another. Lastly, one-way causality existsfrom ECI to CO2, demonstrating that ECI can significantly predictCO2. The causality outcomes are of great importance to policy-makers in the selected nations as all the exogenous variables cansignificantly predict CO2 emissions.5. Conclusion5.1. ConclusionThe current paper assessed the effect of disintegrated en-ergy and economic complexity on carbon emissions in the topeconomic complexity economies. Other drivers of CO2, such astechnological innovation (TEC) and economic expansion (GDP)were incorporated into the model. The current research utilizeda dataset from 1993 to 2018. We utilized second-generationapproaches such as MMQR, Westerlund cointegration, CADF and12838T.S. Adebayo, M. Altuntaş, S. Goyibnazarov et al. Energy Reports 8 (2022) 12832–12842Fig. 2.

Summary of findings from FE-OLS, FMOLS, DOLS and MMQR.CIPS unit root, FMOLS, DOLS, FE-OLS, and DH causality to evaluatethese interconnections. The outcomes of the CD and SH affirmthe use of second-generation techniques. Furthermore, the CADFand CIPS unit root tests outcomes revealed that all the study’svariables are integrated of order I(1). In addition, the Westerlundcointegration confirmed the long-run association between CO2and the exogenous variables. The influence of GDP on CO2 isfound to be positive. This demonstrates that a 1% upsurge in GDPincreases CO2 by 2.70% (FMOLS), 2.10% (DOLS) and 3.20% (FE-OLS). Furthermore, we found a negative effect of GDPSQ on CO2.This demonstrates that a 1% upsurge in GDPSQ mitigates CO2by 0.55% (FMOLS), 0.38% (DOLS) and 0.78% (FE-OLS). Moreover,a negative association was observed regarding the connectionbetween CO2 and NREC. This illustrates that increases of 0.25%(FMOLS), 0.31% (DOLS) and 0.43% (FE-OLS) in CO2 are caused bya 1% upsurge in NREC. Furthermore, we established a positiveECI and CO2 interconnection. This indicates that a 1% upsurge inECI accelerates CO2 by 0.10% (FMOLS), 0.20% (DOLS) and 0.14%(FE-OLS). Moreover, TEC impacts CO2 negatively, as disclosed bythe long-run estimators. This indicates a 1% upsurge in TEC mit-igates CO2 by 0.048% (FMOLS), 0.05% (DOLS) and 0.03% (FE-OLS),respectively. Lastly, we uncovered a negative REC-CO2 intercon-nectedness. This implies that a 1% upsurge in REC decreases CO2by 0.04% (FMOLS), 0.05% (DOLS) and 0.03% (FE-OLS). We alsoutilized the novel MMQR, and the outcomes disclosed that in eachquantile (0.1–0.90), REC enhances the quality of the environment.At the same time, NREC and ECI deteriorate the quality of theenvironment. In addition, TEC curbs CO2 from 0.1–0.70 quantiles,while between 0.80–90 quantiles, TEC harms the quality of theenvironment. The EKC is also validated across all quantiles (0.1–0.90). Lastly, the outcomes of causality disclosed that all theinvestigation variables could strongly predict CO2 emissions.5.2. Policy directionEconomic complexity is linked to the host nation’s R&D andinnovative operations, which aid in producing advanced and so-phisticated products. Regarding policy consequences for a cleanerclimate and environment, the outcomes for economic complexityare highly novel and hopeful. This is explained by the fact thatincreasing economic complexity aids in the structural reorgani-zation of the economy: shifting away from resource extractionand agriculture towards more sophisticated products. Therefore,while formulating economic and energy strategies, policymakersin the top ECI nations must consider the product production com-plexity and structure. Such creative techniques may aid in meet-ing their policy commitments in terms of achieving a cleaner andgreener environment as well as their climate change objectives.12839T.S. Adebayo, M. Altuntaş, S. Goyibnazarov et al. Energy Reports 8 (2022) 12832–12842Likewise, energy use in the form of NREC sources impacts CO2emissions positively. This suggests that the existing energy poli-cies in the selected countries must be re-evaluated. These nationsprimarily depend on fossil fuel-based energy to achieve economicgrowth. This might be because current renewable energy sourcesare insufficient to meet all the energy demands for economicoperations. In this case, the findings of this research might bevaluable for policy measures since they help achieve SDGs 7. Theauthorities of these nations may assist organizations and enter-prises in their attempts to find renewable and cleaner energysources, as well as technology development, as a substitute forthe use of NREC. Such endeavors may contribute to generatingclean and inexpensive energy, hence assisting in achieving SDG7. Regulations at the national level may assist countries withachieving a range of goals, including cleaner and greener growthand job creation.Furthermore, since TEC can only reduce CO2 emissions in0.1–0.70 quantiles, governments should adopt suitable effectivepolicies to limit the impact of GHG emissions. Increased TEC,in particular, can aid in the reduction of CO2 in nations withlow carbon emissions. As a result, authorities should developappropriate policies and allocate adequate resources to encouragethe advancement of TEC. On the flip side, the positive TEC-CO2 connection in the 0.80–0.90 quantiles reveals that the re-duction of CO2 emissions caused by TEC cannot be realized inhigh-carbon-emission nations. As a result, high-carbon countriesshould concentrate their research and development efforts ongreen technologies and low-carbon initiatives.Selected NationsNumber Countries1 Japan2 Switzerland3 South Korea4 Germany5 Singapore6 Austria7
