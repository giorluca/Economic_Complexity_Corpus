We base our analysis on an innovative database that classifies 206,777 regulations by economic sector and region, which highlights the growing volume of regulation, as well as its diversity by sector, region and business cycle stage.This analysis first looks at the aggregate impacts of sectoral regulatory complexity on the employment-to-population ratio, total working hours, sectoral GDP shares, labour intensity and capital intensity. Secondly it delves into the heterogeneous impacts observed across firms of different sizes and ages, drawing on the MCVL (Continuous Work History Sample), a rich database at the enterprise level. On the first front, we estimate a set of multiple fixed-effects model specifications across 13 economic sectors, 23 regulatory sectors and 17 Spanish regions over the period 1995-2020. Our results suggest that greater regulatory complexity has a negative impact on the employment rate and on value added. The effect on employment is consistent with previous findings for the United States. In particular, ceteris paribus, each additional increase in the regulatory complexity index is associated with a 0.7 percent drop in the sector-level employment share. Furthermore, our findings suggest that several distortionary sector-level effects of increasing regulatory complexity are taking place. For instance, markedly lower labour intensity and decreased sector-level investment rates, which confirm that greater regulatory complexity entails non-trivial sector-level costs. Distortionary effects of regulatory complexity materialise through compositional differences, mainly in the form of reduced wages and a lower investment rate.On the second front, using data on employment by firms’ characteristics, we show that the negative impact of regulatory complexity is concentrated on smaller and younger firms. This finding supports the hypothesis that greater regulatory complexity imposes a burden that small and less experienced firms are less able to handle. At the sector level, the manufacturing sectors are the most negatively affected. This may be related to the higher investment required by these sectors.Keywords: sectoral regulation, regulatory complexity, economic sectors, structural policies, employment.JEL classification: K2, R11, J00, E02.ResumenEn este documento se estudia por primera vez el impacto de la complejidad regulatoria a escala sectorial en España en diversas medidas de eficiencia económica. El análisis se fundamenta en una innovadora base de datos que ha clasificado 206.777 normas españolas, tanto por sector de actividad como por comunidades autónomas, y que pone de manifiesto el creciente volumen de regulación, así como su diversidad por sector, a escala geográfica y por etapa del ciclo económico.Estudiamos en primer lugar los impactos económicos de la complejidad de la regulación sectorial de forma agregada en la relación empleo-población, las horas de trabajo totales, las participaciones sectoriales en el PIB, la intensidad de trabajo o la intensidad de capital. En segundo lugar, ahondamos en los impactos heterogéneos observados sobre las empresas con diferentes tamaños y edades, haciendo uso de una rica base de datos a escala empresarial: la Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales. En el primer caso, estimamos un conjunto de especificaciones con efectos fijos múltiples a través de 13 sectores económicos, 23 clasificaciones legales por sector y las 17 comunidades autónomas durante el período 1995-2020. La evidencia sugiere que una mayor complejidad regulatoria tiene un efecto negativo sobre la tasa de empleo y un impacto negativo sobre el valor añadido. El efecto sobre el empleo es coherente con los hallazgos previos para Estados Unidos. En concreto, cada aumento del índice de la complejidad de regulación adicional se asocia con una caída del 0,7% en la cuota de empleo a escala sectorial, ceteris paribus. Además, nuestros resultados sugieren que se están produciendo varios efectos distorsionadores a escala sectorial: la intensidad de la mano de obra es notablemente menor y las tasas de inversión disminuyen como respuesta al aumento de regulación. Estos efectos distorsionadores se materializan a través de las diferencias de composición, principalmente mediante la reducción de los salarios y de la tasa de inversión.En el segundo caso, utilizando datos desagregados de empleo según las características de las empresas, mostramos que el impacto negativo de la complejidad de la regulación se concentra en las empresas más pequeñas y jóvenes. Así pues, este hallazgo apoya la hipótesis de que una normativa más compleja impone una carga que las empresas pequeñas y con menos experiencia están menos capacitadas para manejar. A escala sectorial, el grupo de sectores más afectado es el manufacturero. Esto puede estar relacionado con la mayor inversión requerida en esos sectores.Palabras clave: regulación sectorial, complejidad de la regulación, sectores de actividad, políticas estructurales, empleo.Códigos JEL: K2, R11, J00, E02.BANCO DE ESPAÑA 7 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 23121 Introduction  1.1. Regulation and economic performance  It is now a well-established fact that the institutional framework affects long-term economic development (see, among others, Hall and Jones 1999, Henisz 2000, Rodrik 2000, Acemoglu et. al. 2005 or Fatás and Mihov 2013). In particular, regulation is one of the fundamental pillars of that institutional framework in a mature economy.2 Regulation indeed may be viewed as the vehicle through which structural policies are formulated and expressed (Jalilian et al. 2007, Mora-Sanguinetti and Soler, 2022). Therefore, it should perhaps come as no surprise to find general results such as Djankov et al. (2006), suggesting that improving regulatory performance from the worst quintile to the best quintile may increase the growth rate up to 2 percentage points.  Despite its importance, however, empirical studies on the design and complexity of regulation and its economic impacts, working with norms in a disaggregated way, collecting disaggregated information on their form characteristics or sectors affected, have so far been scarce. This is due in part to the difficulty of accessing and processing this information in order to construct useful and easily trackable quantitative indicators for statistical analysis with variation over time, sector and space. The body of regulation in a developed country can, in fact, have a very considerable volume. In the case of Spain, for example, the entire body of law is made up of hundreds of thousands of norms. Only in 2021, the Spanish administrations as a whole adopted 12,704 norms (Mora-Sanguinetti and Soler, 2022). In addition to the measurement problem, and related to it, it should also be noted that unfortunately there has been a lack of contact and interdisciplinary work in recent decades between economists and jurists, which has hindered the progress of both disciplines. Regulatory analysis seems, in fact, a particularly fertile field for interdisciplinary work (Doménech Pascual, 2014).   The first empirical analyses with these disaggregated characteristics are thus recent and can be found for the U.S. (Dawson and Seater, 2013; McLaughlin et al., 2019) apart from earlier suggestions made by Friedman (2004). In the case of Spain, the construction of quantitative indicators of regulation has also been more recent (Marcos et al., 2010; Econlaw Strategic Consulting, 2009; Mora-Sanguinetti, 2019).   Without the loss of generality, it is perhaps worth asking whether regulation generates positive or negative impacts on economic activity (Mora-Sanguinetti and Pérez-Valls, 2021). This is a question that lies at the forefront of the discussion on the optimal design of regulatory institutions and policies (Ogus, 2004). On the one hand, market regulation can be positive to the extent that it mitigates market failures, such as imperfect information. From the point of view of microeconomic theory, violating the First Welfare Theorem as a result of market failures would be a reason to resort to regulation. Alongside this, according to the Second Welfare Theorem, redistributive regulation could achieve an efficient allocation (Peltzman et al. 1989)                                                               2 We can certainly cite the more "classic" works in this regard such as North (1981, 1990a, 1999) but also more recent examples such as Afonso (2022) On the other hand, from a negative point of view, Laffont and Tirole (1993) point out that market failures are a necessary but not sufficient condition for regulation to exist, since regulation could have a restricted effect for informational, transactional or administrative-political reasons. At one extreme, p orly designed regulation could lead to an increase in transaction costs rather than to their reduction (Helpman 2008)  In summary, regulation would therefore be an instrument for either reducing (Wallis and North 1986, Yang and Borland 1991, Bischoff and Bohnet 2000, Kovac and Spruk 2016) or increasing transaction costs (North 1990b, Gratton et. al. 2021)3. However, beyond the overall and aggregated impacts of regulation on economic activity mentioned at the beginning, it should be noted that, so far, except for the case of the USA, analysis of the economic impacts of regulation, with disaggregated databases that can provide details of the sectoral distribution of regulation, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been addressed.   1.2. Objectives, structure of our paper and summary of the results    This paper aims to assess, in empirical terms, whether sectoral regulation and its complexity generate positive or negative impacts on economic activity. This analysis is carried out for the first time for the case of Spain. To perform the analysis, we rely on a novel database, the first for Spain and the second at the international level4 (to the best of our knowledge), that classifies 206,777 regulations by sector of activity and by Spanish region over the period 1995-2020 (Mora-Sanguinetti and Soler, 2022). The type of indicators constructed quantify the complexity of regulation as explained in section 2. A descriptive analysis of the database shows that regulation and its complexity has been increasing in recent decades but that it is diverse at the sector level, by region and appears to be sensitive to the economic cycle. The interest in the relationship between regulation and the economic cycle has also been analyzed for the case of Italy (Di Vita and Ferrante, 2021).5   Specifically, in economic terms, our analysis first looks at the aggregate impacts on the employment-to-population ratio, total working hours, sectoral GDP shares, labor intensity or capital intensity, but it also delves, in the second place, into the heterogeneous impacts observed over firms with different sizes and ages, making use of a rich database at the enterprise level, the MCVL - Continuous Work History Sample.  The preliminary evidence suggests that greater regulatory complexity has a negative effect on employment rate and has a negative impact on value added. In particular, we show that each additional regulatory case is associated with 0.7 percent drop in the sector-level employment                                                              3 These two references refer to political economy problems. North (1990b) shows that, under flexible budget constraints, politicians may have incentives to increase transaction costs through the overproduction of rules and laws. Gratton et al. (2021) discuss the relationship between the rise of regulation in Italy and the period of political instability in the 1990s. 4 See the references for the analysis of the US case mentioned throughout this article. 5 The authors consider both regulations (and Constitutional Court decisions) affecting Italy as a whole and regional regulations. According to these authors, regulation in Italy would have asymmetric effects on the growth rate of per capita income, in relation to the different phases of the business cycle. 1 Introduction  1.1.

Measuring regulation   2.1  The concept and measurement of regulatory "complexity"  As mentioned, this article makes use of a new set of regulatory indicators for each sector of activity and for each autonomous community of Spain. The aim of the regulatory indicators is to provide an approximation to the "complexity" of the regulatory framework. To clarify, "complexity" is a formal concept that may be measured in different ways: first, as the volume of regulation or, secondly, through its linguistic and relational dimensions. 6  The regulatory indicators studied in this article operationalize the first perspective -measuring the volume of regulation-, which is currently the most developed in the literature (with examples for the United States, Australia or Spain) and is easily quantifiable (Kirchner 2012, Dawson and Seater 2013, Mora-Sanguinetti and Soler 2022)7. For the Spanish case specifically, see also the articles by Econlaw                                                              6 This particular approach is the one developed in De Lucio and Mora-Sanguinetti (2022). 7 On a practical level, one can approximate the "volume" from different perspectives which includes, but is at the same time not limited to, counting the number of norms, the number of regulatory paragraphs or sentences [Waltl and Matthes (2014)], a ratio of the number of norms and pages [Kirchner (2012)] or even the number of words in BANCO DE ESPAÑA 9 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2312share, ceteris paribus. The effect on employment is consistent with the finding of Bailey and Thomas (2017) for the US, which showed that US industries that are more intensely regulated experienced lower employment growth.  Furthermore, our sector-level results uncover a series of distortionary sector-level effects of increasing regulatory complexity that are taking place. These include markedly lower labor intensity and decreased sector-level investment rates, which confirm that expansive regulatory complexity entails non-trivial sector-level costs.

For the Spanish case specifically, see also the articles by Econlaw                                                              6 This particular approach is the one developed in De Lucio and Mora-Sanguinetti (2022). 7 On a practical level, one can approximate the "volume" from different perspectives which includes, but is at the same time not limited to, counting the number of norms, the number of regulatory paragraphs or sentences [Waltl and Matthes (2014)], a ratio of the number of norms and pages [Kirchner (2012)] or even the number of words in Strategic Consulting (2009), Marcos et al. (2010) and Mora-Sanguinetti (2019), who worked on the analysis of regional regulation.  Our regulatory indicators approximate the "volume" by computing the number of new norms adopted each year by each autonomous community and for each sector. If administrations adopt more new regulations each year in a given sector, this will result in a higher indicator. An explicit advantage of such approach is that the overall trend of regulatory complexity is easily 
captured whilst the volume of regulation can be compared across space and time in a relatively straightforward manner.  As a result, we are able to exploit a rich and novel dataset with time series of the complexity of regulation that economic sectors face across different subnational units in Spain. Thus, even if we exploit changes in the volume of regulations, we can rely on the fact that the general legal framework is common across regions. Therefore, our setting provides a unique advantage with respect to cross-national analyses in terms of the comparability between different observations.  The measurement of the volume of regulation in Spain is consistent with respect to other possible measures of “complexity” (readability and number of links) as both this research and the results of De Lucio and Mora-Sanguinetti (2022) show their consistency in Spain. Over time, all measures of complexity have increased hand in hand: the volume of regulation has increased, while its readability has decreased and the number of links has increased.  1.2. The economic relevance of regulatory “complexity”  Measuring complexity is useful from an economic analysis point of view, because it is an approximation of the cost of accessing or understanding the regulatory framework. This cost is higher as the volume and diversity of regulatory administrations increases. More recently, economic theory suggests that firms are more likely to violate regulations that they are unaware of or about which they have doubts as to whether or not they are in force (Bardhan 2002, Di Vita 2018). Not to mention that an institutional framework in which different administrations publishing norms coexist may lead to some costs of coordination and understanding of which norm to apply (Ellingsen 1998, Di Vita 2018).  In practical terms, it is conceivable that complexity translates into the need to contract legal assistance to analyze which regulations are applicable to a given transaction and a greater likelihood of having to pay penalties to administrations for non-compliance, which tends to increase transaction costs. In addition, a complex regulatory framework, for the above reasons, can generate litigiousness and increase congestion of judicial bodies, which implies numerous economic inefficiencies (Palumbo et al., 2013). Consistently, there is evidence specifically for Italy that would link increased regulatory complexity with excessive length of civil court proceedings (Di Vita, 2010). An excessive volume of regulation invokes potential penalties, contracting of legal aid and judicial expedience which can promulgate legal uncertainty. As will be discussed later, the costs of regulation may be proportionally more or less important or burdensome depending on the size of the firms. For example, it is conceivable that a small company may not have its own legal department to advise it, whereas a large company, whether it has in-house legal services or resources to pay for external legal services, may be more certain to face any change in the regulatory environment.   The findings emanating from the existing literature, particularly for the U.S, highlight negative effects of overly complex regulation that translates into both "direct" and "indirect" costs for economic agents. The "direct" costs refer to undesired changes in the behavior of economic agents and the costs incurred in complying with the regulation, such as contacts with the administration or the completion of documentation. The latter have been referred to in some literature as "administrative burdens" or red tape (Kox 2005, López et al. 2008).                                                               different sets of regulations [Mora-Sanguinetti and Spruk (2018)]. For a review of different methodologies, an additional discussion is provided in Mora-Sanguinetti (2019). Strategic Consulting (2009), Marcos et al.

O r r gulatory indicators approximate the "v lume" by computing the umber of new norms adoptedeach year by each autono ous community and for each sector. If administrations adopt more new regulations each year in a given sector, this will result in a higher indicator. An explicit advantage of such approach is that the overall trend of regulatory complexity is easily captured whilst the volume of regulation can be compared across space and time in a relatively straightforward manner.  As a result, we are able to exploit a rich and novel dataset with time series of the complexity of regulation that economic sectors face across different subnational units in Spain. Thus, even if we exploit changes in the volume of regulations, we can rely on the fact that the general legal framework is common across regions. Therefore, our setting provides a unique advantage with respect to cross-national analyses in terms of the comparability between different observations.  The measurement of the volume of regulation in Spain is consistent with respect to other possible mea ures of “complexity” (readability and number of links) as both this rese rch and the results of DeLucio and Mora-Sanguinetti (2022) show their onsist ncy in Spain. Over time, all measures of complexity have increased hand in hand: the volume of regulation has increased, while its readability has decreased and the number of links has increased.  1.2. The economic relevance of regulatory “complexity”  Me suring complexity is useful from an economic analysis point of view, because it is an pproximation of the cost of accessing or understanding the r gulatory framework. This c st is higher as the volum  and diversity of regulatory administrations increases. More recently, economic theory suggests that firms are more likely to violate regulations that they are unaware of or about which they have doubts as to whether or not they are in force (Bardhan 2002, Di Vita 2018). Not to mention that an institutional framework in which different administrations publishing norms coexist may lead to some costs of coordination and understanding of which norm to apply (Ellingsen 1998, Di Vita 2018).  In practical terms, it is conceivable that complexity translates into the need to contract legal assistance to analyze which regulations are applicable to a given transaction and a greater likelihood of having to pay penalties to administrations for non-compliance, which tends to increase transaction costs.

The findings emanating from the existing literature, particularly for the U.S, highlight negative effects of ov rly complex regulation that tr nslat s into both "direct" and "indirect" costs for econo ic agents.The "direct" costs refer to undesired cha ges i  the behavior of economic agents a d the costs incurredin complying with the re ulation, such as contacts with the administration or the comple ion do umentation.

The effect on employment is consistent with the finding of Bailey and Thomas (2017) for the US, which showed that US industries that are more intensely regulated experienced lower employment growth.  Furthermore, our sector-level results uncover a series of distortionary sector-level effects of increasing regulatory complexity that are taking place. These include markedly lower labor intensity and decreased sector-level investment rates, which confirm that expansive regulatory complexity entails non-trivial sector-level costs. Distortionary effects of regulatory complexity materialize through compositional differences mainly through reduced wages and investment rate.  Secondly, when we make use of disaggregated data (MCVL), exploiting information on employment by firms’ characteristics, we show that the negative impact of the complexity of regulation conc ntrates on sm ller and y unger firms. A 10% of new r gulations is related to a 0.5% relative fall in the number of workers employed by firms with less than 10 employees. Thus, this finding supports the hypothesis that a more complex regulation imposes a burden than small and less experienced firms are less capable to handle. At the sector level, the group of sectors most affected is manufacturing. The magnitude of the effect is 50% greater than in the case of the services sector.  The rest of the article is structured as follows: section 2 presents more details on the regulatory database and defines the concept of “regulatory complexity” departing from Mora-Sanguinetti and Soler (2022). Section 3 describes our economic variables based on data provided by the Spanish National Statistics Institute – INE – and the MCVL. Section 3 describes our identification strategy and econometric results for the case of aggregated models. Section 4 describes our identification strategy and econometric results for the case of disaggregated models. Section 5 provides some general conclusions and further discussion of the results from our research.  1. Measuring regulation   2.1  The concept nd measurement of regulatory "complexity"  As mention d, this art cle makes use of a new set of r gulatory indica rs fo  each sector of activity and for each autonomous community of Spain. The aim of the regulatory indicators is to provid  anapproximati n to the "complexity" of the reg latory framework. To clarify, "complexity" is a formalc cept that may be measured in different ways: first, as the volume of regulation or, secondly, throughits linguistic and relational dimensions. 6  The egulatory indicators st die  in this article operation l ze the first perspective -measuring thevolume of reg lation-, which is curre tly the mos  developed in the literature (with examples for theUnited States, Australia or Spain) and is easily quantifiable (Kirchner 2012, Dawson and Seater 2013,Mora-Sanguinetti and S ler 2022)7. For the Spanish cas  specifically, see also the articles by Econlaw                                                              6 This particular approach is the one developed in De Lucio and Mora-Sanguinetti (2022). 7 On a practical level, one can approximate the "volu e" from different perspectives which includes, but is at the s me tim  not limi ed to, counting the nu ber of norms, th  numb r of egul tory paragraph or sentences [Waltland Matthes (2014)],  ratio of the numbe  of norms and pages [Kirchner (2012)]  even the number of w rds in2.BANCO DE ESPAÑA 10 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2312Strategic Consulting (2009), Marcos et al.

For a review of different methodologies, an additionaldiscussion is provided in Mora-Sanguinetti (2019). The "i direct" ones have to do with inefficiencies, which may be generated by the actions (or by undesired chang s in the functioning) of the public institutions thems l s when they operate in contextsof greater reg lat ry complexity: there could b  changes in the size of the public sector and the judicial system could see its congestion increase.  As for specific studies, Dawson and Seater (2013) found, for the case of the United States, that federal regulations added in the last 50 years would have reduced real GDP growth by about 2 percentage points on average in the period 1949-2005. In terms of further example, a study by Di Vita (2017) finds that regulatory complexity has a negative impact on GDP and regional GDP per capita in the case of Italy. More recently, Chambers et al. (2019) concluded that, in the case of the United States, a 10% increase in the effective federal regulatory burden increases the poverty rate by 2.5%.  From a sectoral point of view, which is the focus of this paper, it is worth noting that Bailey and Thomas (2017) showed that U.S. industries that are more intensely regulated experienced a lower rate of firm creation and lower employment growth. Also for the United States, Coffey et al. (2020) identified the sectors affected by regulations and concluded that economic growth in the United States has been held back by federal regulations by 0.8 % per year.  1.3. The intensity of regulatory complexity in Spain in focus   Our database contains 206,777 new norms enacted over the period 1995-2020. 8 Our set of regulatory indicators comes from Mora-Sanguinetti and Soler (2022).  The quantity of new norms increased over time (see Figure 1), this is also the case by sectors and by regions. The regulation variable had a countercyclical behavior, this can be appreciated in the crisis period of 2008-2010 when more laws than usual were enacted, and especially in the period of the COVID crises, the year 2020. 9   Figure 1: Evolution of the volume of total sector regulation (all Autonomous Communities)  Source: Mora-Sanguinetti and Soler (2022)                                                               8 By way of reference, during this period, the Autonomous Communities adopted 219,903 norms (and all the administrations as a whole adopted 300,769). For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the Autonomous Communities, in the entire democratic period (1979-2022) adopted 286,459 norms and the whole of all the administrations 414,272. See also Mora-Sanguinetti (2022).  9 Precisely, the most affected sectors by the COVID, like hospitality, recreational services or textiles, were the ones with the biggest increase in the volume of new laws. 0200040006000800010000120001400019951996199719981999200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017201820192020he "i direct" ones have to do ith ineffici ncies, hich ay be generated by the actions (or by undesired changes in the functioning) of the public institutions the selves hen they operate in contexts of greater regulatory co plexity: there could be changes in the size of the public sector and the judicial syste  could see its congestion increase.  s for specific studies, a son and Seater (2013) found, for the case of the nited States, that federal regulations added in the last 50 years ould have reduced real P gro th by about 2 percentage points on average in the period 1949-2005.

The findings e anating fro  the existing literature, particularly for the .S, highlight negative effects of overly co plex regulation that translates into both "direct" and "indirect" costs for econo ic agents. The "direct" costs refer to undesired changes in the behavior of econo ic agents and the costs incurred in co plying ith the regulation, such as contacts ith the ad inistration or the co pletion of docu entation. The latter have been referred to in so e literature as "ad inistrative burdens" or red tape ( ox 2005, López et al. 2008).                                                               different sets of regulations [ ora-Sanguinetti and Spruk (2018)]. For a revie  of different ethodologies, an additional discussion is provided in ora-Sanguinetti (2019). Strategic Consulting (2009), Marcos et al. (2010) and Mora-Sanguinetti (2019), who worked on the analysis of regional regulation.  Our regulatory indicators approximate the "volume" by computing the number of new norms adopted each year by each autonomous community and for each sector. If administratio s adopt more new regulations each ye r in a given sector, this will result in a higher indicator. An explicit advantage ofsuch pproach is th t the overall tr nd of regulato y complexity is easily captured wh lst the olum   regul tion can be compared across space and time in a relativel  tr ightforwa d manner.  As a result, we are able to exploit a rich and novel dataset with time series of the complexity of regulation that economic sectors fac  across d fferent subnational units in Spain. Thus, even if we exploit changesin th  volu e of regulations, we can r ly on the fact that the gener l legal framework is common cros  regions. Therefo , our setting provid s a unique advantag  with respect to cross-national analyses in t rms of the comparability between different observations.  The measurement of the volume of regulation in Spain is consistent with respect to other possible measures of “complexity” (readability and number of links) as both this research and the results of DLucio and Mora-Sanguinetti (2022) show their c nsistency in Spain. Ove  time, all measures of complexity have increased hand in hand: the volume of r gulation h s increased, while its readability has decreased and the number of links has increased.  1.2.

Not to mention t at an institution l framework in which different administrations publishing norms coexist ay lead to some costs of coordination and understandi g of which n rm to apply (Ellingsen 1998, Di Vita 2018).  In practical terms, it is conceivable that
