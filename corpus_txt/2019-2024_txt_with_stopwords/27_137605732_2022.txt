Here, we address theneed for new methods of "seeing" urban superdiversity in twoways. First, we highlight the need to understand urban contextsby examining new combinations and intersections of multiplesocial variables. Second, we demonstrate a suite of newinteractive tools. We attempt to enable users to picture, perceiveand apprehend complex analyses of multidimensional data onurban diversity in new, more intuitive ways. This visualizationdraws on multivariate geo-spatial data on different kinds ofdiversity, across three major destination cities: Sydney, Vancouver,and Auckland.

While the superdiversity concept has been variouslyinvoked and critiqued (see Creese & Blackledge, 2018; Vertovec, 2019; Meissner et al.,in press), many scholars find the concept useful because, similarly to the concept of inter-sectionality (Khazaei, 2018), it emphasizes the need to look beyond ethnicity as a primaryor sole marker and determinant of migrant trajectories of settlement, integration andsocial mobility (Piekut et al., 2012). In a condensed way, the concept of superdiversityseeks to emphasize the complex nature of these trajectories and their outcomes (Crul,2016). For example, it acknowledges that new configurations of recent migrants tendto inhabit those urban spaces that still host previous waves and generations of migrantsand their descendants – in many cases alongside Indigenous Peoples (Meissner et al.,2015).1 Despite the considerable interest in superdiversity from academics, policy-makers and NGO practitioners (e.g. Phillimore et al., 2020), such combinations of“old” and “new” diversities remain sorely under-researched by social scientists andunder-addressed by policymakers (Vertovec, 2015) – in part, because such complexityis literally difficult to visualize.In this article, we argue that visualizing urban superdiversity is important in in twoways. First, because social, cultural and economic characteristics are rapidly having com-pound effects in urban areas inhabited by old and new diversities, we highlight the needto understand urban contexts by examining new combinations and intersections of mul-tiple variables – including those variables that are neglected or entirely new. Second,because such multivariate explorations require better ways of “complex thinking” (cf.Walby, 2021), we advocate developing innovative data visualization tools that areequipped to handle analyses of multivariate data on urban diversity, while enabling awider range of audiences to picture and apprehend abstract information aboutdifferent combinations of social variables in more intuitive ways. In sum, we arguethat studies by urban geographers and migration researchers would benefit from recon-ceptualizing diversity in multidimensional ways, and developing compelling new ways of“seeing” this multidimensional superdiversity in the available data. This, we believe, canhelp to advance the methods and theories needed to study the unprecedented diversifica-tion occurring in contemporary cities, and to underpin more effective policies and morecomprehensive public understanding of urban superdiversity.To be clear, though, we believe that while our approach represents an important stepforward in visualizing and understanding contemporary diversity, we do not claim it tobe a panacea. Data, including the information collected by governments, both simplifiessocial reality and is predicated on the perceived need to govern and control. In usingthese data, we inevitably incorporate the limitations inherent in their collection, suchas the assignment of individuals to ethnic or religious categories based on theiranswers to a survey instrument, or the assumption that individuals spending, say, 40percent of their income on housing are facing equal financial pressure. Data andmaps, of course, emphasize certain phenomena and ignore others, and while they havebeen used to enlighten people they also subjugate and oppress populations. Further,2 S. VERTOVEC ET AL.our tools emphasize visual representations of data and cannot capture the sounds, smells,and sense of human life and interaction in cities.2 These are very real limitations and con-cerns, but we argue that our approach represents a useful addition in representing andcomprehending data, given these limitations.Social geographies of difference in the study of cities.Social scientists have been interested in urban diversity for more than a century and thistopic has been enmeshed with the development of sociology and geography as disci-plines. Georg Simmel wrote about “the stranger,” for example, in 1908 and some ofhis ideas were embraced by Robert Park and the Chicago School of urban sociology,which had an enormous impact on twentieth century understandings of the city. Theirarguments about residential segregation – together with their over-simplified maps ofthe socio-cultural spaces of Chicago, with concentric parts of the city designated as“ghetto”, “Deutschland”, “Chinatown” and “Little Sicily” – became iconic. This workset in motion several abiding assumptions about the supposedly natural and properincorporation of immigrants, and the resulting residential order of the city: that ethnicgroups are coherent “communities” sharing a range of socio-cultural and economictraits; that these communities occupy relatively homogenous spaces as “immigrant colo-nies” (Burgess, 1925, p. 56); that residential location is a proxy for socio-economic status;and that assimilation is an inevitable, even natural, process.Twentieth-century urban studies is therefore characterized by maps of cities thatreflect what we call “ghetto thinking”: the idea that the segregation of bounded andcoherent minority groups is an inherent urban condition that is deeply and pervasivelyintertwined with the “problem” of socio-economic deprivation (Wirth, 1928; Peach,2003, 2009; Collins, 2012). Early efforts to generate statistical indices of segregationand economic marginalization were products of this approach.This scholarly consensus was both reinforced and challenged by the quantitative revo-lution that brought digital analysis into urban studies during the 1960s. At the time, itwas considered revolutionary that researchers could acquire comprehensive data andfeed this information into mainframe computers to generate maps and statistics; thiswas heralded as a new field of study and dubbed “spatial science” (Billinge et al.,1984). This era also saw the application of multivariate statistics to urban analysis andthe development of the factorial ecology model, which involved subjecting a largematrix of socio-economic data to factor-analytic approaches in an effort to discern theunderlying structure of urban social geography (Berry, 1971). Typically, within the fac-torial ecology model, complex data were distilled into three core factors that werebelieved to shape the residential order: ethnic difference; socio-economic inequality;and family life cycle. Although later authors in this tradition acknowledged that thethree-factor model was insufficient, these techniques produced more nuanced modelsof cities than was previously possible; nonetheless, their problematic overall goal wasto “cut through” complexity and to simplify it (Davies & Murdie, 1993).Subsequently, the Chicago School and quantitative models of urban geography werepanned by various humanist, neo-Marxist, feminist, and post-colonial scholars(Plummer, 1997). During the late twentieth century, urban geography and sociologyfavored critical approaches stressing the nature and forms of urban inequality;URBAN GEOGRAPHY 3meanwhile, methods drifted from the quantitative to the qualitative. Post-modern urbantheorists pointed to the breakdown of the homogenous, concentric functional zonesmodelled by Burgess and others, and highlighted the emergence of more chaotic,multi-nodal urban structures (Ellin, 1996; Dear & Flusty, 1998). Significantly, all thisoccurred as the social geography of immigrant-destination cities was being profoundlytransformed by new and more complex global migration flows (Castles et al., 2013),and by gentrification (see Lees et al., 2013), often under the influence of neo-liberal pol-icies (Pinson and Journel, 2016). Together, these developments displaced whatever sal-ience the Chicago School model of inner-city ghettos and assimilated suburbs mighthave had – though perhaps more fully in scholarly circles than in the public imagination.However, the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have also seen the re-emergence of efforts to offer new insights about urban diversity. One key interventionhas been the concept of intersectionality, developed from within Black feminist scholar-ship to emphasize the mutually constitutive nature of social categories, particularly race,class, and gender (see Hill Collins & Bilge, 2016). Leslie McCall (2005, p. 1772), forexample, has called for extending the insights of intersectionality approaches to “thecomplexity that arises when the subject of analysis expands to include multiple dimen-sions of social life and categories of analysis.” Our interests in superdiversity aregrounded in the same mode of understanding: it is important to recognize the combinedeffects of multiple variables in producing socio-economic outcomes. Further, we shareMcCall’s (2001) concerns about the need for better methods and theories regardinghow new complexities, and new combinations of social variables, create and (re)produceforms of multi-layered inequalities.The term superdiversity, coined by Vertovec (2007), refers to the increasingly multi-dimensional effects of contemporary diversity. Rather than fixating on differences ofnationality and ethnicity when analysing diversity, it draws attention to variations in"language, and religion as well as the motives, patterns and itineraries of migration,and the processes of insertion into the labour and housing markets of destinationcities" (Blommaert & Rampton, 2011, p. 1). Scholars who work with the concept arethus interested in disaggregating the black boxes of conventional social categories, posit-ing “complexity” as the new baseline for social analysis (Meissner et al., 2015). Whereas –following a Chicago School perspective – places once deemed “multicultural” were per-ceived as containing large spatial concentrations of nominally homogenous and minorityethno-religious groups, places considered superdiverse are recognized as containing mul-tidimensional kaleidoscopes of smaller groupings, in which new and old forms of diver-sity interact to form new configurations and categories of social difference along withnew challenges for service providers (Vertovec, 2015; Phillimore, 2010; Berg et al., 2019).Crucially, the different phases in the understanding of cities that we have just outlinedare each associated with different ways of “seeing” urban life. The Chicago School, andthe decades of research it inspired, saw inner cities as patchwork quilts of areas eachdominated by particular, often immigrant, groups – all of which were in the processof ultimately achieving cultural assimilation and economic affluence, so that they even-tually moved “upward and outward” to leafy suburbs that exemplified the “Americandream”. Cities were not only widely understood in this way but also designed accordingly(e.g. through zoning regulations which stipulated building densities). Quantitativemodels of the 1960s and 1970s encouraged a view of urban complexity as superficial4 S. VERTOVEC ET AL.“noise”, distracting scholars and others from the impacts of diversification. Cities, andtheir neighbourhoods, were seen as variations on a limited number of themes. Ratherthan acknowledging and grasping the complexity of urban contexts, the views ofurban planners “seemed to be premised on (and… sought to impose) a homogeneityacross the diverse urban field” (Fincher & Iveson, 2008, p. 2).Conversely, intersectionality and superdiversity encourage us to see urban complexityas just that: complexity. We underscore complexity by drawing on several key notions incomplexity theory in both natural and social sciences and specifically: complexity ascharacterized by phenomena such as an increase in the number of variables or agentsin a system; an increase in the differentiation of characteristics; an increase in interdepen-dencies among agents and variables; and the highly contingent, unpredictable and non-linear emergence of new systems and effects (cf. Jörg, 
2011; Portugali et al., 2012; Byrne &Callaghan, 2013). Various forms of stratification are present because of factors associatedwith age, class relations, patriarchy, racialization, heteronormativity, and legal differen-tiation – but none of these is the single ordering principle of urban life. Rather, urbansociety is the product of all these forces – and more – operating simultaneously and inter-actively, with this complexity amplified by the arrival of migrants from diverse sourcecountries and regions, via varied legal or extra-legal pathways.To fully grasp the nature of superdiversity, we need new ways of unpacking conven-tional social science categories and new ways of seeing complex and evolving interactionsamong multiple forms of social difference. To address this challenge, at least in part, ourcentral aim in this paper is to demonstrate a new suite of interactive data visualizationtools that enable users to conduct intersectional analyses of multidimensional urbandatasets. Our demonstration draws on innovatively compiled new datasets on the popu-lations of three major immigrant-destination cities: Sydney, Vancouver, and Auckland.These tools adapt and update some established quantitative methods for analysing diver-sity, guided by new and more nuanced conceptual understandings of intersectionalityand superdiversity. In doing so, we aim to contribute to a new methodological andanalytical approach to exploring the nature and significance of urban superdiversity.Visualizing superdiversity on various scalesThe methodological field of multidimensional data visualization has mushroomed overthe last quarter century. During the 1990s, greatly decreasing data storage costs and expo-nentially increasingly network bandwidth were already enabling the construction ofenormous, fine-grained multidimensional datasets in many companies and governmentagencies. However, until the early 2000s, the tools and technologies for reporting, analyz-ing, distributing, and making decisions based on these data were rudimentary (Eick,2000, p. 61). A number of popular visualization methods did enable the presentationof two or three variables (dimensions) at the same time; standard techniques included“x-y (-z) plots, line graphs, bar and column charts, area, staked bar and columngraphs, histograms, pie charts, doughnut charts, box plots, radar graphs [and] Paretographs” (Marghescu, 2007a). But due to the dearth of tools for effectively displayingmore than three variables simultaneously, much of the new and bigger data remainedin raw relational tables that required extensive training to access, manipulate andreport. Over the past 15 years, however, the tools and techniques of multidimensionalURBAN GEOGRAPHY 5data visualization have expanded and improved significantly, driven both by the need toanalyze new “big data” produced by the contemporaneous worldwide expansion of hand-held internet devices, social media, and processes such as algorithmic financial trading.By the end of the 2000s, financial and other big-data researchers had added a range of4 + dimensional data visualization methods to their analytical toolkits, such as multipleline graphs, permutation matrices, survey plots, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinates,treemaps, Sammon mapping, self-organizing maps, star-glyphs, and dendrograms (seereviews by Marghescu, 2007a, 2007b). As the range of users demanding insights frombig data has expanded over the past decade from fields as wide-spread as healthcare ana-lytics, energy provision, entertainment, accounting, paralegal and marketing, the fields ofdata science and immersive data visualization have become more dynamic and a firmlyentrenched area of research at major research institutions around the world (Pezanowskiet al, 2022; Bergmann & Lally, 2021; Fernandez et al., 2021).Across a number of social science disciplines, a growing literature demonstrates thepower of the new class of multi-dimensional data visualization techniques for conductinganalyses of social difference (see, for instance, Dorling, 2012; Jung & Anderson, 2017;Healy, 2019). However, it is surprising how seldom such analytical approaches have beenapplied to the studyof intersectionality and superdiversity, even though these concepts expli-citly call for multivariate analyses of social difference. Below, we address this research gap,presenting a variety of data visualizations that allow the viewer to “see” superdiversity byway of different combinations of variables and their significance. We hope that by bringingtogether concepts, data, and techniques of visualization, we can encourage a re-imaginationof the complexity of contemporary cities. The visualizations depicted and described belowcan be accessed on a special website, where interactive elements can be found for each ofthe three cities and their respective data (https://superdiv.mmg.mpg.de/). On this website,the viewer can choose a range of variables, timeperiods andviews, and can also explore com-parative aspects of superdiversity across the cities.Our argument is that (1) many cities are becoming superdiverse, (2) superdiversity is amulti-dimensional concept and (3) contemporary data visualization approaches can helpus to perceive, picture and apprehend its multiple dimensions. The contribution of thisarticle is therefore methodological and analytical rather than empirical: we do examinesome specific multidimensional datasets on urban superdiversity, but we do so inorder to demonstrate the potential of these new interactive data visualization toolsrather than to present any specific new empirical findings from these data. Details onthe data sources, definitions of terms, statistical techniques, decision-making processesand other aspects surrounding the creation of the superdiversity data visualizationscan be found in a technical paper (Hiebert, 2019).3The cities we use to demonstrate our tools – Sydney, Vancouver, and Auckland –share several similarities and differences that make them excellent candidates for explor-ing new methods in urban superdiversity studies. They do not by any means representthe epitome or the entirety of urban diversity. There is much research on citiesoutside the so-called Angloworld, but we do not talk about them because we do notlive in them do not have anything to add directly to the excellent work being donethere. Instead, we write about the cities which we live in and know a lot about andwhich we think are important for a range of reasons. For example, the three citiesshare similar colonial and settler origins, and have all transitioned through the late6 S. VERTOVEC ET AL.twentieth century to become key migrant destinations and gateway cities within a globa-lized migration system (Freestone et al., 2006; Gilbertson & Meares, 2013; Good, 2009;Spoonley & Bedford, 2001). This has led to profound change whereby local historicalindustrial and urban landscapes have been transformed, especially those situated nearthe metropolitan cores. Gentrification has proceeded apace in centrally located neigh-bourhoods and new, highly diverse, migrant settlement has suburbanized, leading tohighly complex patterns of diversity across and within cities along with significant,and largely unprecedented, planning challenges (Burnley & Hiebert, 2001; Gurstein &Hutton, 2019). Also, while the profile of migrant groups varies between the cities, inall cases, there are complex relationships between migrant status, a variety of intersectingvariables, and inequality.In the sections below, we selectively report data and visualizations from these cities inorder to exemplify specific features of the visualization tools, and offer specific multi-variate relationships that allow us to see, and to illustrate, how these analyses cansupport more nuanced understandings of the nature and significance of urban superdi-versity. We provide a range of different visualization tools, from conventional displayssuch as line charts, treemaps, and Sankey diagrams with interactive components, to inno-vative “dials” for interacting with intersectional data, to immersive multidimensionalmaps that we consider prototypes for more advanced geostatistical tools. The idea isthat different user groups with different levels of expertise and different purposes(from exploration and analysis to communication) will find different tools useful.Data visualization tool #1: origin country and migration categoryThe point of our data visualization tools is to help audiences understand the presence andoutcomes of intersections of different types of social difference in cities. Our first visual-ization tool does this by contextualizing national-level migration data on a modifiedstacked area chart. Here, the x-axis shows the year of arrival, and the y-axis shows immi-grant numbers per year, by admission category. However, where a simple stacked areachart displays only these two variables, our visualization tool allows users to also disag-gregate the data by region and country of immigrant origin. The user does this by click-ing the stacked chart on their screen to select a given stream-year (e.g. economicmigration in 1996 or humanitarian migration in 2001), which generates and displays atreemap of the same data (Shneiderman & Wattenberg, 2001, P. 1). In this way, usersof our site can simultaneously picture and apprehend four key variables: origincountry, origin region, visa category, and arrival year.Multivariate analyses using this data visualization tool can reveal a range of importantpatterns. For example, Figure 1 is a screenshot showing how this data visualization toolcan be used to explore permanent immigration to Canada over time. It shows how per-manent immigration has grown, especially in the last decade, and has come from agrowing number of different source countries and regions. (Though not shown here,the tool reveals the same pattern in all three countries). The method can also reveal chan-ging relationships among the places where immigrants originate from on one hand, andthe visa categories on which they enter a country on the other – thus revealing howdifferent admission categories (humanitarian, family, etc.) draw immigrants fromdifferent places at different points in time. For example, the humanitarian treemaps inURBAN GEOGRAPHY 7Figure 1 show how the flow of refugees and other humanitarian immigrants to Canadawas dominated by people escaping Cold War conflicts such as Vietnam in the 1980s but,over time, other conflicts and places became important sources, notably those in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. By displaying four key variables on the samechart (origin country, origin region, visa category, and arrival year), the tools letviewers picture and apprehend how the changing flow volumes through differentmigration corridors between places, and different immigration channels defined byvisa category, have shaped elements of superdiversity in each city.Figure 1. Permanent immigration to Canada 1980–2017 and Countries of origin for immigrants toCanada, “Humanitarian” category, 1980 and 2017.8 S. VERTOVEC ET AL.Data visualization tool #2: ethnicity and religionOur modified stacked chart is useful for visualizing the changing size of simple categori-cal data over time, but less apt for visualizing more complex categorical social data. Ournext superdiversity visualization addresses this problem using a modified “Sankeydiagram” of diversity at the metropolitan scale (Figure 2). Named after the Irish engineer,Matthew H.R Sankey, who originally used it to map power flows in steam engines, suchdiagrams are often used to show the interaction between two highly complex variables(Schmidt, 2008). Figure 2 shows the intersection between two kinds of highly complexdiversity: ethnicity and religion, both of which break down into very large numbers ofdistinct categories.4 Both are also “nested” variables: “Lutherans” are nested in the cat-egory of “Protestant Christians”; Germans are nested in the larger group of “Europeans”.This nesting is shown on the left and right sides of the graphic. The specific relationshipbetween the most basic ethnic and religious categories is shown in the middle column,with lines connecting specific ethnic and religious categories. These lines are pro-portional in width to the number of people included in each ethnicity/religion intersec-tion (say, German Lutherans). They are also shaded so that the line begins with the colouron the opposite side of the diagram to enable viewers to quickly see the composition of agroup (e.g. those identifying as “Australians” are mainly affiliated with “Christianity”(purple) or “No religion” (yellow)). If the relationship between ethnicity and religiousaffiliation was simple, this part of the diagram would be dominated by single, non-inter-secting lines – for example, between Swedes or Germans and the Lutheran faith, Italiansand Catholicism, or between Indians and Hinduism.What the Sankey diagram reveals is that the social worlds of these cities are anythingbut simple. For example, in the Sydney chart shown in Figure 2, there are 6,433 lines,Figure 2. Linkage of ethnic and religious identities in Sydney, 2016.URBAN GEOGRAPHY 9each representing a distinct pairing of ethnicity and religion. We see familiar associations(e.g. Indians and Hinduism, Greeks and Orthodox Christianity), but also a myriad offiner details that, upon close examination on the website, reveal unexpected combi-nations, an example being those individuals who choose to portray themselves asJewish when asked about their ethnicity, and Muslims when answering the census ques-tion on their religious identification.5Such analyses allow us to better comprehend one of the central conceptual pointsabout superdiversity, which is that it involves increasing diversity within conventionalcategories of social difference. The members of nearly every ethnic group follow amixture of religions, just as nearly every religion has adherents from many ethnic back-grounds. Muslims in Sydney, for example, indicate 228 ethnic or ancestral origins,including many Middle Eastern groups but also dozens that might surprise many,such as Irish and Brazilian. There are also 150 ethnicities associated with Buddhism,194 with the Pentecostal faith, and 145 associated with Greek-Orthodox Christianity.Switching perspective, Australians of English ancestry are fragmented into 124 religiousaffiliations (including non-believers). Significantly, Arab-Australians subscribe to 41different faiths and Australians who identified as Māori indicated 54 religious affiliations.Australia’s growing religious diversity has been highlighted before (e.g. Bouma, 2012:2016; Bouma & Hughes, 2014; Bouma et al., 2022) but never visualized in such kaleido-scopic detail. As mentioned previously, this intra-category complexity not only hasimplications for the labels we use in social research, but also for social policy and practice,in which individuals have heretofore often been selected to “represent” the interests of apurportedly homogenous “community” (see Phillimore et al., 2020). In line with themore abstract descriptions of the previous superdiversity literature, what our visual ana-lyses suggest is not just that the number of communities in cities has increased throughsuccessive waves of immigration, but that we need to fundamentally rethink the cat-egories of social analysis that we use to classify and measure social difference and solidar-ity in twenty-first Century cities.Data visualization tool #3: income diversity and ethnic diversitySankey diagrams can cope with two variables, but superdiversity involves multiple variablessuch as arrival time, admission category, residential mobility, educational achievement, andincome level. Moreover, Sankey diagrams cannot reveal the spatial distribution of diversityin cities. We have therefore developed two further superdiversity data visualization toolswhich process Census data collected at the fine-grained scale of lived spaces in cities,thereby providing insights into the social composition of neighbourhoods.6Our tools are deliberately innovative and to some extent experimental, and their visualoutputs (shown in Figures 3 and 4) are unconventional. Traditional maps of urban diver-sity typically show the location of ethnic or income groups, using colour ramps 
that pullthe eye toward areas where specific groups are concentrated, giving the impression thatthe city is made up of a patchwork of relatively discrete social areas with each group occu-pying a distinct space – a way of seeing that reflects what we referred to at the outset ofthis paper as outdated “ghetto thinking”. To address this traditional cartographic limit-ation, we took an alternative approach: instead of mapping different types of social group,we created a new geospatial tool for mapping different types of diversity. Our maps10 S. VERTOVEC ET AL.contrast areas of social simplicity (low diversity) with areas of social complexity (highdiversity), highlighting where people frommany different backgrounds mix. We envisionsuperdiverse places as those containing many different types of diversity, where everydayencounters routinely involve multiple forms of social difference, and where residents atleast have the potential to engage with newcomers on a regular basis.7We focus on several key types of diversity: Ethnic Diversity, Income Diversity, Edu-cational Diversity, Generational Diversity, Admission-category Diversity, and Degreeof Mobility. We calculated an index for different types of diversity, giving each city neigh-bourhood a score for each type of diversity. To simplify the user learning curve with these“multi-dimensional” maps, we developed two visualization tools: one designed to revealcomplexity through a relatively simple approach based on traditional cartographicmethods (Tool #3, shown in Figure 3); and the other deploying a more complex andinteractive set of options which will appeal to readers comfortable with the use of multi-variate statistics (Tool #4, shown in Figure 4).The simpler tool (Tool #3) is shown in Figure 3: a bivariate choropleth map of Van-couver showing the degree of ethnic and income diversity simultaneously. A bivariatechoropleth map is a traditional cartographic technique that shows two different charac-teristics of the same geographical area simultaneously. Figure 3 does this by using twocolor scales. The pink scale shows ethnic diversity while the green scale shows incomediversity. In this scheme, pink + green = blue: that is, blue neighbourhoods have highdegrees of both ethnic and income diversity. The central business district, just northof the “Vancouver” label, is light colored, indicating that the population living in theCBD is comparatively homogeneous in terms of ethnic origin and income – inkeeping with an area dominated by loft conversions and recently-built condominiumtowers that appeal to a quite specific and narrow demographic. However, inner-cityneighbourhoods surrounding the CBD contain either people from different ethnicFigure 3. Ethnic and income diversity in metropolitan Vancouver, 2016.URBAN GEOGRAPHY 11backgrounds but similar income levels (pink), or from both diverse ethnic and diverseincome groups (blue). In other words, people likely encounter socio-economic differencein these areas on a regular basis – a finding which naturally raises questions for migrationand diversity researchers about whether such encounters lead to mutual respect (Valen-tine, 2008). Further out from the urban core, the map shows patches of pink (indicatinghigh ethnic diversity coupled with low levels of income diversity), and patches of green(indicating high income diversity coupled with low ethnic diversity) – moving us to askhow and why specific types and configurations of diversity gravitate towards specificlocations. Thus, the key benefits of the visual analyses facilitated by our new tools is tosuggest new and important questions for further research.Figure 4. Inner Vancouver, population size, ethnic diversity, and admission category diversity, 2016and Wider Metropolitan Vancouver, population size, ethnic diversity, admission category diversity,and income diversity, 2016.12 S. VERTOVEC ET AL.Data visualization tool #4: diversity of income, ethnicity, and admission-categoryOur maps reveal an urban landscape of many different types of diversity and their myriadcombinations, inviting viewers to pay attention to more complex juxtapositions andlayers of difference and belonging. Rather than stopping at two kinds of social difference,our more complex maps show many different types of diversity simultaneously. Eachdifferent diversity index is displayed as a map color or as a superimposed column thatmay vary in color, opacity, height, and width. These graphics are hard to display on aprinted page; they work better on screen, and best through virtual reality goggles or inan immersive visualization Cave (Cruz-Neira et al., 1992). But as with our other visual-izations, the core aim of the tool is to enable viewers – in this case viewers with some levelof expertise – to see urban superdiversity in complex, multivariate data.Figure 4 is an illustration of how this tool can be used to picture, perceive, and appre-hend the intersection of many different types of diversity. The top of the figure zooms inon ethnic diversity (depicted by map background color, from low-yellow to high-purple)in central metropolitan Vancouver. Population size has been added to the graphic, indi-cated by the height of a column atop each neighborhood, as well as an index of admissioncategory diversity (depicted by column color). That is, most of the immigrants living inareas with yellow columns were admitted to Canada through a single category, whileareas with purple columns have received immigrants from multiple categories where,for example, refugees and economic immigrants mix with those who came to Canadathrough family reunification provisions or other means. A clear east/west divideappears. In the affluent west, most immigrants were admitted through economic chan-nels, particularly as skilled workers, entrepreneurs, or investors. In the east, a greater pro-portion of immigrants came as family or humanitarian entrants. Interestingly, manyethnically diverse neighbourhoods (purple backgrounds) have low admission categorydiversity (yellow columns), suggesting a complex relationship between ethnic diversityand legal status that, once again, invites further research (e.g. Meissner et al., 2017).The complexity becomes visually overwhelming in the lower part of Figure 4, whichzooms out to the wider metropolitan region, while adding yet another dimension:income diversity, shown by wider columns. Now, differing levels of ethnic, categoryand income diversity are splashed haphazardly across all metropolitan areas. Almostno neighbourhoods have narrow, yellow bars on yellow backgrounds, which would indi-cate inhabitants with similar ethnic, admission category and income backgrounds. Muchmore common are neighbourhoods with wide purple bars on purple backgrounds, indi-cating the presence of ethnic, admission and income diversity all at once. The onlyobviously discernable pattern is one of complex diversity, though additional researchmight identify important, previously unexplored factors.These maps generate many questions that deserve more research, for example, con-cerning the relationship between diversity and affluence, between diversity and transpor-tation accessibility, and between diversity and “urbanity” in major twenty-first centurycities. Gone entirely are the traditionally expected concentric zones, and even thesimple east/west pattern of immigration category diversity breaks down at this scale.What emerges is a chaotic, multi-nodal layout of social complexity (see Piekut et al.,2012).URBAN GEOGRAPHY 13Data visualization tool #5: multiple characteristics by multiple outcomesOur maps operate at the scale of urban neighbourhoods, but an important point aboutsuperdiversity is that individuals simultaneously fall into multiple social categories,specific intersections of which may have significance to social life in each city. Thenext visualization, Figure 5, therefore enables users to explore superdiversity and inter-sectionality at the level of the individual person, studying the interaction of ethnicity,immigration arrival, age, and gender with five or six socio-economic characteristics.This set of “dashboard” visualizations enables viewers to consider the socio-economicoutcomes associated with an imaginary individual, once they select that person’s age,gender, ethnicity, and immigration history (again, on our website, the viewer can interactwith the visualization tools to do this).Once these controls are set, the visualization shows the statistical likelihoods that theperson will: have a university education; be employed; speak English (or, for Vancouver,French) at home; have at least a modest income (i.e. not be experiencing low income);live in affordable housing; and own a home. For each of these variables, a dial indicatestheir propensity to have the attribute in question relative to that of the entire working-agepopulation, which is set to the top of the dial. Therefore, the indicator would be to the leftof the dial for employment, for example, if the selected individual is less likely thanaverage to be employed, and to the right if they are more likely to be employed.Figure 5. Characteristics of selected Auckland residents, 2013.14 S. VERTOVEC ET AL.These kinds of data have been analysed, and presented by researchers for decades,either in tabular form or via regression models. However, relatively few people havethe capacity to absorb information from highly detailed tables and fewer still understandeconometric interpretations of data. We argue that audiences, by interacting with dataand seeing outcomes change with each different combination of selection variable cat-egories, will instantly gain a deeper appreciation of both the complexity of society andthe degree of contingency of socio-economic outcomes. The power of this visualizationcan be seen by maintaining as many choices constant as possible and just changing one ortwo elements at a time.We turn to Auckland to illustrate how the dashboard visualization can be used tocompare the characteristics and outcomes for both migrants and the locally born, andhow this process underscores the importance of both intra-ethnic and as well as inter-ethnic differences and dynamics. We focus on one aspect here for the case of Auckland:migrants and their descendants versus the Indigenous Māori. To demonstrate the pointthat immigrants themselves typically experience a socio-economic trajectory as theysettle and come to terms with the host society, we compare one immigrant group,Indians, at two different age points. The first concerns those Indians 18–24 years ofage, who might be undertaking post-secondary education or have entered the workforce(the left-most panel of Figure 5). The second concerns those Indians who are older (35-44), and clearly shows the high number in this cohort who have now obtained a univer-sity degree, and the fact that many earn a high income (the second panel of Figure 5).These Indian migrants were likely admitted under the Skilled Migrant [Visa] Categoryand the favorable economic results can be seen in post-arrival socio-economic outcomes.Nevertheless, despite this upward mobility, the homeownership rate for this cohort isonly slightly above average, perhaps not so surprising given that the cost of housing inAuckland is so high (Auckland Council, 2018).A very different set of outcomes is apparent if the comparison is made with the Indi-genous Māori population (middle panel, Figure 5). Māori from the same age group (35-44 years old) are much less likely than the Indian migrants to have a degree, to beemployed or to own a home. In settler cities like the three we focus on, this dimensionof migrant socio-economic mobility, when compared with apparently fewer opportu-nities for Indigenous Peoples, is a sensitive and challenging concern. To pursue thisfurther, we compare migrant and New Zealand-born Pasifika communities (theseinclude migrants and their descendants who originate in a range of Pacific states suchas Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Cook Islands, Tokelau, and Niue), again concentrating on thesame age group. The final two panels of Figure 5 provide dashboard stories forPasifika peoples who have been born in New Zealand and for Pasifika who are immi-grants to New Zealand.The socio-economic indicators for Māori and New-Zealand-born individuals whoidentify as Pasifika are roughly similar but differ sharply from other groups. Both, asnoted, are less affluent than their India-born counterparts in the same age cohort. Buton all five indicators the situation is particularly bleak for relatively new immigrantswho identify as Pasifika in origin. This reinforces the point that there are some immigrantcommunities, or parts of those communities, that experience socio-economic poverty,labor or housing market deprivation and disengagement, and educational outcomesURBAN GEOGRAPHY 15that are similar to those of a marginalized and impoverished Indigenous community.Why?This is a modest interrogation of the material that is available for Auckland, but ithighlights the sharply differing stories of migration, diversity and diversification, bothin relation to ethnicity/indigeneity and the intersection of ethnic diversity with a rangeof socio-economic factors. There are multiple ways of exploring and “seeing” thesestories of diversity but there are two elements that deserve to be emphasized: one isthe complexity that results from the intersection of ethnicity with other forms of diversity(particularly socio-economic profiles), both between groups and within groups. And theother is the layering of migration as recent groups join those from earlier migrationswhile, as settler cities, all three are host to Indigenous populations. The nuances ofthese complex intersections and configurations of social variables are difficult toconvey using conventional social science methods such as bivariate tabulation, staticcharts, and abstract statistical models. By contrast, the contribution of our dashboardand other visualizations is to enable viewers to picture, perceive and apprehendcomplex, multivariate, intersectional social information.We also note that in numerous public presentations of the dashboard tool, partici-pants have been struck by the technique of holding everything but one variable constantand cycling through the categories of the variable of interest. For example, in Vancouver,for individuals aged 25–34 who were born in Canada to immigrant parents, the ratio ofthose with a completed university degree varies widely between groups, with the corre-sponding dial at a low position on the left side for those identifying as Black or LatinAmerican, and at the opposite extreme for those identifying as Korean, Indian, orChinese. For those who are already engaged in these issues, the visualization confirmswhat they know and can be used to illustrate their requests for additional resources;for those just exploring these issues for the first time, the results are often registered asshocking.ConclusionIn this paper we seek to add our voice to those of others working in the innovative field ofmultidimensional urban data visualization, by developing new tools and applying exist-ing ones to the topic of urban superdiversity. Our paper does not advance the idea thatcurrent-day diversity is unprecedented and everywhere. Instead, we note that more andmore people are becoming interested in superdiversity as a concept, and that empiricalwork needs to catch up with theoretical speculation. To address this, the paper introducesa set of new visual analytic tools designed to test whether superdiversification is actuallyhappening in specific places. Our tools show how four specific cities of interest are gettingmore superdiverse, and we suggest that similar tools may be useful for exploring whethersimilar trends are happening in other cities.This paper is not intended as an empirical contribution to the study of migrant-drivendiversity in Sydney, Vancouver, and Auckland. Instead, the contribution is methodologi-cal and analytical: it demonstrates a suite of five new data visualization tools developed bythe authors to enable various users to comprehend multidimensional urban superdiver-sity in innovative ways. As we noted at the outset of this article, earlier approaches to thegeography of cities explained the city in terms of discrete 
ethnic minority socio-spatial16 S. VERTOVEC ET AL.zones and assumed an inevitable endpoint of “assimilation”. While these perspectiveshave been criticized for half a century and have been shown to be outmoded, they never-theless continue to influence scholarly thinking about diversity in urban settings, charac-terized by a view of ethnicity as a primary determining characteristic, ethnic groups asrelatively homogeneous “communities”, and enclaves as monopolized by particulargroups. Academics may have come to eschew the ideas of the Chicago School, butmany still think of “Chinatowns” or “Little Italy’s” in ways that are often not farremoved from those original caricatures. Many still tend to “see” the city as a patchworkof neighbourhoods defined by their ethnicity.We offer an alternative to much of the earlier work on urban complexity and theunderpinning assumptions by stressing the need to re-conceptualize the nature of thecontemporary immigrant-destination city and by providing a means of understandingthe resulting configurations of complexity. It is not enough to focus just on the ethnicityof those involved as agents. Intersectionality requires that there be a recognition of age,gender, legal status, religion, and class as an important step in acknowledging categoricaldiversity that, in turn, highlights the need for much deeper intersectional analysis thatrecognizes and explains intra-category diversity.To underscore this, we have discussed selected ways of visualizing superdiversity andthe kinds of things that it is possible to “see” and understand as a result. The main advan-tage of such superdiversity visualizations, as we have demonstrated through the selectedexamples, is the ability to observe the combined effects or intersections of multiple vari-ables and the outcomes they produce. But we would also invite readers to note that theseare our visualization selections and interpretations. The information that has becomeaccessible can be used in different ways and for different purposes by others. In thespirit of this paper, which stresses the complex nature of urban diversity, there areendless options in visualizing that diversity available from the data that we offer – anda similar opportunity to interpret the data. Subsequently, there are at least threebenefits such combined-variable visualizations afford by way of our understanding ofurban complexity.1. “Seeing” the combined and differential effects of variables raises a range of criticalresearch questions, including: why do particular outcomes occur, over what period?What social, historical, or policy-based condition(s) is(are) responsible for such out-comes (especially ones relating to specific modes of inequality such as employment oreducation)? Addressing the questions raised by new visualizations in turn encouragesthe development of theory surrounding migration and urban diversification.2. Placing such visualizations side-by-side enables new methods for understandingthrough comparison. For instance, significant similarities and differences betweengroups in corresponding cities –Vancouver, Auckland, and Sydney – are immediatelyapparent in ways that were largely unrecognized previously. Better comparisons, ofcourse, lead both to a better understanding of each place and to overarching insightsand theory.3. By rendering detailed and multifaceted data into quickly grasped formats, a wider,non-academic audience can gain a better appreciation of a range of diversification out-comes – especially modes of inequality. As we have already found in presenting thesesuperdiversity visualizations to politicians, policymakers, NGOs and members of theURBAN GEOGRAPHY 17public, compelling graphics offer a successful way for non-specialists to comprehendcomplicated data. In this way, we hope that a more nuanced understanding ofcomplex inequalities might occur and that a more effective use of targeted resourcesresults. Further, these can help generate evidence-based discussions about criticalpolicy and political concerns. The political tendency in some quarters to simplifyreality represents an important obstacle to debates about such matters as social cohe-sion or representation in diverse cities. As Peach (2009) warned, debates about segre-gation have mis-characterized the data on residential diversity and therefore, thepolitical response.It is anticipated that the increasing complexity of global migration will continue tochange cities and add to their already existing complexity (IOM, 2018). The dynamicsinvolved and the resulting outcomes entail a range of processes and factors. As research-ers, we need to ensure that we are successfully adapting our methods and conceptualunderstanding to engage with these emergent complexities of intersections, divergences,and outcomes. New datasets, new software programmes and – as we have argued here –new ways of visualizing data have crucial roles to play in fostering complex thinking andmore comprehensive understandings of the ways that global migration is shaping citiesand influencing (or more actively, structuring) the lives of the people who dwell in them.Notes1. In this context, where the three cities that we are using to illustrate how we visualize super-diversity are all located in settler-colonial states, “Indigenous” refers to those who occupiedthe territory prior to European colonization and who remain as tribes/nations, albeit asimpacted negatively by that colonization and who remain marginalized and impoverishedin several ways.2. A reviewer of this paper made the point that, in so doing, we are “ocularcentric”, which is avalid assessment. However, we note that journal articles and websites, by their very nature,privilege visual information. The lead author of this paper has also constructed a "Datarama"installation, into which users enter and see 360 degree views of urban street life, and can hearthe sounds of urban life as well as observe recorded interpersonal interaction – but this is atopic for another paper.3. The technical paper solely describes how we collected the data, defined our indicators andvariables, and how we prepared the data for visualization. The current paper focuses on theoverall analytical approach, particularly it’s multidimensional character and its visualcharacter.4. For example, Statistics Canada recognized 256 ethnic categories in the last Canadian Censusin 2016, and is considering recognizing over 600 categories for the 2021 Census (personalcommunication with Daniel Hiebert).5. We are aware, as one of the reviewers of this paper noted, that “Jewish” can be seen as areligious and/or ethnic category. However, in this case we are reporting that a smallgroup of individuals (without prompting) identify themselves using this combination of cat-egories and, in so doing, indicate that they believe that being Jewish and Muslim are notmutually exclusive forms of identity. We believe that this example illustrates the complexityof urban social life through the formation of unexpected hybridities.6. The three censuses differ in the granularity of data they release to the public. All our sources,definitions and data matters are covered in an associated technical paper (Hiebert, 2019).7. Full details of our index definitions and data can be found in Hiebert (2019). Our diversityindices were defined as follows: Ethnic Diversity = number of ethnic group identities per18 S. VERTOVEC ET AL.area, divided by area population; Income Diversity = a Simpson’s Entropy Index [SI] basedon income deciles; Educational Diversity = SI calculated using broad census-based cat-egories of educational attainment; Generational Diversity = SI based using the following cat-egories: third-generation residents of the country, second-generation residents, long-settledforeign-born residents, recent foreign-born residents, and non-permanent residents;Admission-category Diversity = SI calculated using admission categories of Economic;Family, Humanitarian, and Other; Degree of Mobility = the percentage of residents whodid not live in their current geographical area five years earlier. For mapping purposes,we examined both raw index values and simplified each index into an ordinal scale oflow, medium, and high diversity.AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to the following for technical assistance: David Barnes, Stamen Design,Vinay Dixit, Robert Didham, Andreas Hamacher, Ernest Healy, Toan Nguyen, Aateka Shashank.We are grateful for feedback on drafts from: Gary Bouma, Francis Collins, Darshan Vigneswaran,Brenda Yeoh.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).ORCIDSteven Vertovec http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0177-9194Paul Spoonley http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8487-5717Alan Gamlen http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1432-0526ReferencesAbel, G.
