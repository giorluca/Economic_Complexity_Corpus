 1  Multidimensional Economic Complexity: How the Geography of Trade, Technology, and Research Explain Inclusive Green Growth  Viktor Stojkoski, Philipp Koch, César A. Hidalgo1 Center for Collective Learning, ANITI, TSE-R, IAST, IRIT, Université de Toulouse, 31000 Toulouse, France  Abstract To achieve inclusive green growth, countries need to consider a multiplicity of economic, social, and environmental factors. These are often captured by metrics of economic complexity derived from the geography of trade, thus missing key information on innovative activities. To bridge this gap, we combine trade data with data on patent applications and research publications to build models that significantly and robustly improve the ability of economic complexity metrics to explain international variations in inclusive green growth. We show that measures of complexity built on trade and patent data combine to explain future economic growth and income inequality and that countries that score high in all three metrics tend to exhibit lower emission intensities. These findings illustrate how the geography of trade, technology, and research combine to explain inclusive green growth.  Introduction  Sustainable development is often defined as the process of meeting human development goals while simultaneously sustaining the natural environment1–4. This approach implies that development and environment are interdependent, and that economic growth can be sustained only if it is inclusive and green5,6.   To achieve sustainable development, countries need to consider the interconnections between economic, social, and environmental factors7–12 . This multiplicity of factors, however, can be hard to quantify and compare. Economic complexity methods provide a solution to this problem13,14. By leveraging data on the geographic distribution of economic activities, these methods can be used to  1 Corresponding author, e-mail: cesar.hidalgo@univ-toulouse.fr  2  estimate the implicit presence of multiple economic factors, and consequently, to explain international variations in economic growth15–24, income inequality25–27, and emissions28–31.   Today, the most commonly used metrics of complexity are based on trade data23,30,32. Trade data, however, can miss key information about innovative activities, such as patent applications and research publications that could be relevant for the geography of inclusive green growth. For example, research and technology can shape production processes, affecting the skills and compensation of workers and the emission intensity of industrial activities. Moreover, trade-based metrics of complexity can systematically underestimate the complexity of economies that are distant from global markets, which in turn might distort predictions about their inclusive green growth33,34. That is, the complexity of some economies that are rich in natural resource exports, but distant to markets, such as Australia, Chile, and New Zealand, might be better reflected in their ability to produce outputs such as scientific research and patentable innovations than sophisticated exports. The same may be true, but in reverse, for manufacturing heavy economies that are deeply integrated into their neighbors’ value chains, such as Mexico or Czechia. These are countries with a complex tradeable product sector, but as we will show, with comparatively less sophisticated research and innovation sectors.   That is why the recent literature in economic complexity has begun using data on patents35, employment36,37, and research papers38, to estimate the complexity of countries, cities, and regions. But these metrics are rarely combined in work using complexity methods to explain the geography of inclusive green growth39,40.  To bridge this gap, we introduce a multidimensional approach to economic complexity that combines data on the geography of exports by product, patents by technology, and scientific publications by field of research. We use this approach to explain variations in economic growth, income inequality, and greenhouse emissions.   But why would the complexity of economies explain the geographic variation of inclusive green growth? Economic complexity metrics capture information about productive structures that escapes simple aggregate, such as GDP. Unlike GDP, which sums value added regardless of the activities involved, economic complexity metrics capture information about the sophistication of these activities. Consider the exports of X-rays and iron ore. The contribution of these exports to GDP is equal to their  3  export value, but their contribution to economic complexity is quite different, since X-rays are a high complexity product (pushing the complexity of an economy up) while iron ore is not. In fact, according to data on the Observatory of Economic Complexity41, X-rays have a product complexity of 1.46 whereas iron ore has a product complexity of -1.84. Since complexity metrics are related to the knowledge intensity of economic activities, a unit of GDP generated through the production of X-rays should be cleaner and more inclusive than a unit of GDP generated through iron ore mining.  This is an opportunity cost argument. Consider the economies of Switzerland, Singapore, or Sweden. These economies engage an important part of their population in relatively sophisticated activities (they are high complexity economies). While these activities have an associated level of emissions, an ability to contribute to economic growth, and affect the way in which income is distributed, complexity metrics do not capture their contribution to these outcomes in absolute terms. Instead, they capture their contribution relative to other activities. In simple terms, they capture the idea that, in the absence of X-ray equipment production, some of these engineers would be involved in mining.  Thus, we expect measures of economic complexity to help us explain variations in macroeconomic outcomes if they are effective at capturing information about economic structures. Also, we expect these methods to benefit from data about multiple activities (e.g. trade, patents, and research).   In fact, we find that the combination of trade, patent, and research publication data significantly and robustly improves the ability of economic complexity methods to explain inclusive green growth. In particular, metrics of trade and technology complexity—but not of research complexity—combine to explain international differences in economic growth and income inequality. In addition, countries that score high in all three metrics tend to have lower emission intensities. We also find that there is a negative interaction between trade and technology complexity when explaining growth, indicating that some of the information captured by these two metrics is redundant (and hence the metrics are partly substitutes). However, we find no negative interaction when explaining income inequality. Finally, when it comes to emissions, we find that interaction terms dominate the models, meaning that countries with lower emissions tend to score high in all complexity metrics. These results are robust to a variety of controls (total exports, number of patents, number of publications, GDP per capita, etc.) and are confirmed by an instrumental variable robustness check where the complexity of each country is replaced by the average of its most structurally similar neighbors.   4   These findings expand the knowledge about the role of economic complexity in inclusive green growth and help open a new avenue of research that explores the combination of multiple sources of data to create improved policies for achieving sustainable development.   Methods   Economic complexity metrics are derived from specialization matrices, summarizing the geography of multiple economic activities (using dimensionality reduction techniques akin to Singular Value Decomposition or Principal Component Analysis)28,42. In particular, given an output matrix 𝑋!", summarizing the exports, patents, or publications of an economy c in an activity p, we can estimate the economic complexity index 𝐸𝐶𝐼!  of an economy and the product complexity index 𝑃𝐶𝐼"	of an activity, by first normalizing and binarizing this matrix:   𝑅!" =𝑋!"𝑋𝑋"𝑋!) , (1)  𝑀!" = +1					𝑖𝑓	𝑅!" ≥ 10					𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒	,  where muted indexes have been added over (e.g., 𝑋" = ∑ 𝑋!"! ) and 𝑅!" stands for the revealed comparative advantage of economy c in activity p.  And then defining the iterative mapping:   𝐸𝐶𝐼! =#$!∑ 𝑀!"𝑃𝐶𝐼"" , (2)  𝑃𝐶𝐼" =#$"∑ 𝑀!"𝐸𝐶𝐼!! 	.  That is, according to (2), the complexity of an economy c is defined as the average complexity of the activities p present in it (and vice-versa). The normalization steps in (1) and (2) are required to make the units of observation comparable (e.g. China and Uruguay are very different in terms of size). The solution of (2) can be obtained by calculating the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue of the matrix:   5   𝑀!!% =9𝑀!"𝑀!%"𝑀!𝑀""!% (3)    Which is a matrix of similarity between economic c and c’ normalized by the sum of the rows and columns of the binary specialization matrix 𝑀!" (it considers similarity among economies counting more strongly rare coincidences).    To obtain 𝐸𝐶𝐼!, the values of the eigenvector are normalized using a z-score transformation (meaning that the average complexity is 0). In regression analyzes we further normalize the values of 𝐸𝐶𝐼! to be non-negative using a max-min technique (i.e., they are between 0 and 1).   We use this method to estimate three separate metrics of economic complexity: 1) trade complexity (ECI (trade)), using export data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity41, 2) technology complexity (ECI (technology)), using patent applications data from World Intellectual Property Organization's International Patent System; and 3) research complexity (ECI (research)), using published documents data from SCImago Journal & Country Rank portal42. We investigate their individual and combined contribution to explaining international variations in economic growth, income inequality, and emissions intensity. The economic growth and emissions intensity of a country are estimated using GDP and emissions data from the World Development Indicators43, whereas the income inequality data are taken from the Estimated Household Income Inequality44,45. See Supplementary Information (SI) for a detailed description of the data.  Results  International differences in Multidimensional Economic Complexity  Figure 1a presents three binary specialization matrices (𝑀!") for countries’ exports by product, patents by technology, and publications by research area for the year 2014. Colored dots indicate that a country is specialized in an activity, i.e., that its exports, patent applications, or number of papers are larger than what is expected from that country’s or that activity’s output (𝑀!" = 1).    6  Figs. 1b and c compare the three ECI rankings and Fig. 2 compares the ECI values. These show that, while these metrics are correlated, they recover the qualitative behavior motivating this research: that trade-based measures of complexity tend to underestimate the complexity of some countries that are far from global markets (e.g., Australia and New Zealand) and overestimate the complexity of some manufacturing economies (e.g., Mexico and Czechia).   For example, consider Mexico (MEX), Czechia (CZE), Australia (AUS), and New Zealand (NZL). Mexico and Czechia rank high in trade complexity (MEX is #24 and CZE is #6) but lower in technology and research complexity. Mexico drops to #26 in the technology rankings and to #44 in the research rankings, whereas Czechia ranks #22 in technology and #34 in research. This could be explained in part by the fact that Mexico’s and Czechia’s exports do not serve global markets, but the value chains of their neighbors. In fact, over the last decade, 76% of Mexico’s exports went to the United States (ranked #12 in trade complexity) and 31% of Czechia’s exports went to Germany (ranked #3 in trade complexity)41. For comparison, the number one export destination of the median country represents 21% of its total exports, meaning that the United States and Germany are, respectively, heavily overrepresented in Mexico and Czechia’s exports.   Australia and New Zealand show the opposite pattern. Both countries rank relatively low in trade complexity (AUS is #76 and NZL is #47) but are global leaders in technology and research rankings. Australia ranks #8 in technology complexity and #3 in research complexity, while New Zealand ranks respectively #12 and #10. This is explained in part by the fact that Australia and New Zealand are far from global markets and export commodities to China, a country that is over 7,000 kilometers away from their capitals. Thus, trade data misses key aspects of the complexity of these economies that is recovered using data on patents and research.  7   Fig. 1.

Multidimensional Economic Complexity and Inclusive Green Growth  Next, we explore how the information provided by technology and research complexity combines with trade complexity to explain international variations in future economic growth, income inequality, and greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate this question piecemeal, first by employing models that include each variable separately, then, by including variables together, and finally, by using interaction terms. In addition, we test for robustness by using an instrumental variable approach and several controls.  We follow the literature15,30,32 and set up panel regressions of the form  𝑦!& = 𝑓;𝐸𝐶𝐼!&' 	< + 𝑎(𝑋!& + 𝜇& + 𝑏) + 𝑒!& ,	 where 𝑦!& is the dependent variable for country 𝑐 in year 𝑡	 (economic growth, income inequality, emission intensity), 𝑓;𝐸𝐶𝐼!&' 	< is a function of the three complexity indices (d = trade, technology, or research), 𝑋!& is a vector of control variables that account for other key factors (e.g. population, GDP per capita, etc.), 𝜇& describes time-fixed effects to account for any unobserved period-specific factors, 𝑏) is the intercept, and 𝑒!& is the error term, (see Supplementary Information (SI) Section 1 for more information about the data and SI Section 2 about the regression specification).   We then validate and select a separate “multidimensional model” for growth, inequality, and emission intensity using the following criteria. First, the multidimensional model must lead to the largest  9  significant increase in explanatory power over the baseline model (given by the coefficient of determination 𝑅* and validated by a Wald F-test). The baseline model includes GDP per capita (and its square in the case of inequality) and time-fixed effects. Second, in the multidimensional model all included complexity coefficients (individual and interaction terms) must be statistically significant. Finally, we require the model to pass two types of robustness checks. First, we check for robustness by exploring whether the effects hold after including additional explanatory variables. These are measures of size (population), human capital (years of education), dependence on natural resources (natural resource exports per capita), and metrics of the intensity of each respective output (exports per capita, patent applications per capita, and number of research documents per capita). We also try alternative definitions of complexity46,47  and check whether the results hold for non-complexity metrics, such as measures of market 
concentration (Shannon information entropy and the Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI)) (see SI Sections 3.1 and 3.2). We call the model with all significant and robust explanatory variables the “final model.” This is the best model at explaining variations in economic growth, income inequality, and emission intensity.  Second, we also use an instrumental variable approach, where complexity values are replaced by the average complexities of three similarly specialized countries. This is designed to address the possibility that the relationship inferred in the multidimensional and final models between economic complexity and the studied macroeconomic outcomes may be endogenous when local conditions lead to both higher complexity and better outcomes. By replacing complexity estimates with the average of countries with similar specialization patterns, we decouple complexity estimates from other local conditions.   Economic growth: Economies with high levels of complexity relative to their GDP per capita are known to experience faster long-term economic growth15–18,21,24,48–51. The idea is that higher complexity economies can participate in sophisticated sectors that support higher wages. But while this relationship has been repeatedly validated using trade15–17,51 and employment data21,37, there is a lack of research exploring whether technology and research complexity play a similar role.  Here we test the effect of trade, technology, and research complexity on economic growth by looking at the 10-year annualized GDP per capita growth (in constant PPP dollars) using two periods 1999-2009 and 2009-2019. The baseline model includes the log of the initial GDP per capita (in constant  10  PPP dollars) and time fixed-effects (see SI Section 4.1). This captures Solow’s idea of economic convergence52 (baseline model is presented in column 1 of table 1, 𝑅* = 0.26).  Table 1 shows the effect of the three complexity metrics and their interactions. We find that trade complexity is a significant and positive predictor of economic growth (column 2, 𝑅* = 0.36) and that technological complexity has a similar explanatory power (column 3, 𝑅* = 0.34). Research complexity, however, is not significantly related to future economic growth (column 4, 𝑅* = 0.26) (see SI Section 4.2). We also find that technological complexity significantly enhances the ability of trade complexity to explain future economic growth (columns 5-7 of table 1). This effect increases when we interact them (columns 8-11 of table 1), leading to our multidimensional model (column 9). The multidimensional model leads to an improvement in explanatory power over the trade complexity regression of 7 percentage points (𝑅* = 0.43). In this regression, both trade and technology complexities have a positive impact on growth, but their interaction term is negative and significant, suggesting a strong substitute relationship. In general, countries with larger trade ECI than technology ECI experience higher growth, but countries that score poorly in both dimensions experience lower growth. Also, the F-statistics imply that the coefficients of the trade and technology ECI remain significant even when including the log of population and the log of human capital. In addition, the multidimensional model clearly outperforms similar models based on production intensity, measures of diversification, and other measures of complexity. Trade and technology ECIs also outperform measures of concentration (entropy and Herfindahl-Hirschman). The final model includes the multidimensional ECI (trade, technology, and their interaction), the Solow term (GDP per capita), the log of the human capital, and the log of natural resource exports per capita (see SI Section 4.3).             11  Table 1.

The F-statistics for the model in column 9 were estimated using models estimated in tables S4-S8.       12  Income inequality: Economies with less complex trade structures are also known to exhibit higher levels of income inequality25–27. The idea is that firms operating in knowledge intense activities promote inclusive institutions because of their need to attract and retain talent. Firms in less complex activities, do not face this constraint, and benefit from a more extractive institutional environment. Thus, we should expect higher levels of economic complexity to be associated with lower levels of inequality.  To explore the ability of multidimensional complexity to explain variations in income inequality we model an economy’s Gini coefficient, a standard measure of inequality. Larger values for the Gini coefficient indicate larger income inequality. We divide the data into four four-year panels: 1996-1999, 2000-2003, 2004-2007, 2008-2011, and 2012-2015 and set up a baseline model given by the Kuznets curve: the idea that as an economy develops market forces first increase and then decrease income inequality53 (Gini ~ GDP per capita, its square, and time fixed-effects, see SI Section 5.1).   We find that trade and technology ECIs are significant and negative predictors of income inequality with, respectively, 𝑅* = 0.55  (column 2 of table 2) and 𝑅* = 0.50 (column 3 of table 2). Trade and technology ECIs also outperform measures of concentration (entropy and Herfindahl-Hirschman, see SI Section 5.2). Moreover, they provide an important improvement over the baseline model, which has an 𝑅* = 0.35 (column 1 of table 2). Research ECI, however, is only a minor predictor of income inequality providing little improvement to the explanatory power (𝑅* = 0.37, column 4 of table 2).  Again, the model combining trade and technology provides the best explanatory power (columns 5-11 of table 2). However, the interaction term between trade and technology is not significant, meaning that the two complexities do not behave as substitutes or complements. The multidimensional model is given by column 5 of table 2 (𝑅* = 0.57). This model is also robust when including the log of population and log of human capital and outperforms similar models based on production intensity, measures of diversification, and other measures of complexity. The final model—the one that best explains international variations in income inequality—includes the log of population and human capital in addition to the multidimensional ECI and the Kuznets term, (see SI Section 5.3).      13  Table 2.

Emission intensity: Trade complexity is known to be associated with lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of output30 and better environmental performance54,55. The idea is that the emissions required to, for instance, produce a unit of GDP by extracting tin ore are larger than the emissions required to produce a unit of GDP by manufacturing metal cutting machines. Here, we explore whether the technology and research dimensions add to the ability of trade complexity to explain emission intensity by modelling the logarithm of a country’s yearly greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP (in kilotons  14  of CO2 equivalent per dollar of GDP). Larger values represent larger emission intensity. We divide our analysis into five panels: 1996-1999, 2000-2003, 2004-2007, 2008-2011, 2012-2015, and 2016-2018 (the last panel is three years due to limited emissions data). The baseline model includes the log of the GDP per capita (constant PPP dollars), capturing the idea that more developed economies should have lower emission intensities30, and time fixed-effects (see SI Section 6.1).   Unlike in the previous two cases, here we find that individual ECI measures do not perform better than metrics of concentration (Entropy, Herfindahl-Hirschman index) and other complexity measures (Fitness) (see SI Section 6.2). Nevertheless, the best multidimensional complexity model is robust and includes the three-way interaction between trade, technology, and research complexity (𝑅* = 0.30, column 11 of table 3, Fig. 3 c). This implies that countries that score high in all dimensions (e.g., Sweden, France, Austria) have the lowest emission intensities (see SI Section 6.3). The final model includes also measures of population size, human capital, natural resource exports per capita and production intensity: the logarithms of exports per capita, patents per capita, and publications per capita (𝑅* = 0.45, column (14) of Table S21 in SI Section 6.3). This means that the measures of complexity explain variation in emission intensities that go beyond the variation accounted for by the natural resource export intensity of an economy.                 15   Table 3.

The F-statistics for the model in column 9 were estimated using models estimated in tables S20-S24.    In Fig. 3 we summarize our empirical findings. Adding complexity metrics for technology and research can improve the ability of the regression models to explain variations in economic growth, income inequality, and emission intensity. In fact, our final models explain more than 50% of cross-country variation in economic growth, income inequality, and emission intensity (Figs. 3a-c), a drastic increase compared to including only trade metrics. Technology complexity adds to the ability of trade complexity to explain economic growth and income inequality, and trade, technology, and research  16  complexity complement each other in their ability to explain greenhouse gas emissions (Figs. 3d-f). We also calculate the overall marginal effect of the different ECI coefficients by creating a multidimensional ECI by weighting each ECI coefficient according to the size of the regression coefficient in the final model, and re-estimating the final model of economic growth, income inequality and emissions intensity.  The multidimensional ECI is correlated with increases in economic growth and decreases in income inequality and emissions intensity (Figs. 3g-i).   Nevertheless, we find that the individual effect of different dimensions of complexity is not always linear since complexity estimates interact. In the case of economic growth, the negative interaction suggests a mild substitution between these two variables (high 
complexity in exports and technology help explain growth, but there is no additional effect of scoring high on both). In the case of inequality, the effects seem to be linear and additive since the interaction term here is not significant. Finally, for emission intensities, we find significance across all interaction terms, meaning that we expect to observe lower emissions in economies that score high in the three complexity metrics. This validates the idea that complexities in different forms of activities combine to explain inclusive green growth. But are these results robust to possible omitted variables?   To further validate these results, we pursue an instrumental variable approach where we replace a country’s complexity values with those of its three most similar neighbors. The idea is that there might be factors that are either local (e.g., culture, geography) or relevant only to certain dependent variables (e.g., country-specific environmental policies for GHG emission intensity) that could drive both complexity and macroeconomic outcomes. To decouple local factors and conditions from our complexity estimates, we replace the complexity values of each country with the average of the three countries with the most similar specialization pattern (based on the conditional probability that two countries are specialized in the same vector of activities56 (exports, technologies, research areas), see SI Section 7.1). For example, in 2014 Japan’s export structure was similar to that of Germany, South Korea, and Great Britain whereas Australia’s technological structure was similar to Great Britain, Spain, and Canada. In SI Section 7.1 we provide a full list of the three most similar economies in 2014 for every country and dimension used in our analysis. We find the results remain virtually unchanged, reducing the risk that the explanatory value of these complexity metrics comes from an omitted local factor (F-statistics for the Wald restriction tests are given in Tables 1-3, see also SI Section 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4).    17    Fig. 3.

Conditional correlations are obtained by controlling for all other factors included in the final models.   Discussion  Economic complexity methods have become important tools to explain regional and international variations in inclusive green growth57–64. Yet, most applied work on economic complexity relies on metrics derived from trade data that are limited in their ability to capture information from non-trade activities. This can lead to distorted estimates for the complexity of certain countries and limited  18  information about how different types of activities combine to explain variations in inclusive green growth.   Here, we combined trade, technology, and research data, to explore the role of complexity metrics in inclusive green growth. We found that technology complexity adds to the ability of trade complexity to explain economic growth and income inequality, and that trade, technology, and research complexity complement each other in their ability to explain greenhouse gas emissions. We also found that complexities expressed in different forms of activities sometimes interact. Trade and technology complexities are partly substitutes in the growth regression, but not in the inequality model. Moreover, in the emission intensities model the highest predictive power was obtained by the model with the triple interaction, meaning that lower emission intensities correlate with countries that score high in all three metrics of complexity.  But what do these results mean?   On the one hand, product exports and patent applications can be easily tied to monetary outcomes such as economic growth or income inequality (e.g., product exports generate revenues, whereas patents generate royalties). Thus, the structure of these activities should contribute directly to monetary outcomes, unlike the geography of research papers which may have a more indirect effect. Emission intensities, on the other hand, seem to correlate negatively with the presence of complexity in trade, technology, and research, suggesting that countries with lower emissions are sophisticated across these three dimensions. For instance, Australia’s high emission intensity can be explained by its lack of sophistication in exports65. Yet, we should also expect Australia’s emission intensity to be relatively low compared to countries with a similar export structure, because of Australia’s high complexity in technology and research.  These results are relevant for identifying strategic areas for economic diversification and development, as they provide a more holistic target than the one provided by metrics of trade complexity alone30,32. This should be of interest to policy makers using complexity metrics for inclusive green development and reinforce the idea that metrics of economic complexity go beyond measures of trade sophistication33,34,62,66,67. In fact, our results show that the combination of multiple metrics of  19  complexity is key to extract information about the role of economic structures in inclusive green growth.  Yet, this approach is not without limitations.   First, patent application and research publication data also have limitations. For instance, since patent applications and research documents are usually written in English, these datasets can favor both, English speaking countries (e.g., USA, Australia) and countries with high proficiency in English (e.g., Netherlands, Sweden).   Second, there are plenty of activities that are not captured in either trade, patent, or research publication data—such as services, digital products, and cultural activities. These may capture additional aspects of the complexity of economies that would need to be included in a more comprehensive multidimensional framework16,68,69. Unfortunately, the current state of the art does not include internationally comparable fine-grained datasets for these additional activities (e.g. service trade data is too aggregate to approximate the productive structure of an economy, see Ref.70 and SI Section 8).   Third, our research is also limited by differences in the granularity of the three datasets: trade data is the most granular, with about 1,200 unique products, while research publication data involves only about 300 subject categories. This may be one of the reasons why we do not see strong effects from research complexity in economic growth and income inequality, and one of the reasons why combining these datasets into a unified matrix (e.g., by concatenating or multiplying these matrices) is non-trivial.   Fourth, these results cannot be readily generalized to other geographic scales, such as states and provinces. For instance, while future economic growth has been shown to correlate with the complexity of countries15,17,20,51,64 and regions70, the relationship between complexity and inequality is known to reverse at the regional scale21,71–74. Thus, this approach cannot tell us much about regional effects, which could be different from those observed at the international scale21,72–75.   Yet, despite these limitations, multidimensional complexity improves upon the state-of-the-art when explaining international differences in economic growth, income inequality, and greenhouse gas emissions. These findings advance our understanding of the role of economic complexity in inclusive  20  green growth and should motivate new research on comprehensive metrics of complexity and sustainable development.

For each country and a given year, we approximate the magnitude of trade in a particular product category through the export value, the level of activity in a research area through the number of published articles in that field, and the number of innovations in a technological class via the number of patent applications in the class. In each year, we restrict our analysis to countries which: • had population above 1 million; • had a total product export value of more than 1 billion USD; • had more than 4 patent applications; • had more than 30 scientific publications.  Adding a threshold for the minimum intensity in trade, patent applications or scientific publications is a standard in the economic complexity literature. It helps reduce the noise in the data arising from small economies whose specialization structure greatly varies over the years1–3.    1.1. Product exports data We look at country-goods associations by using international trade data with goods disaggregated into categories according to the HS4 classification. With this classification we end up with 1241 product categories. More detailed classifications which disaggregate the goods into more categories, such as the HS6, can also be used. However, then the number of categories is not comparable to the number of scientific fields and patent classes, thus making distortions in the  2 level of the disaggregation of the different dimensions. For each year, we remove from the analysis the products whose total world exports were less than 500 000 USD. The data are taken from the Observatory of Economic Complexity 4. Figure S1 gives the histogram for the distribution of the share of exports to the main export partner for each country (for the period 2010-2019), which was used to argue that Mexico and Czechia are integrated into their neighbors’ value chains.

The patent data in this system are based on the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).  3 Each patent application under the PCT simultaneously seeks protection for an invention in many countries. This reduces the potential home bias which may arise when using patent data that come from a single Patent Office. We classify the patents by residence of inventors according to the Cooperative Patent Classification, disaggregated to a 4-digit level, and in each year include only patent classes for which there were more than 5 applications. After clearing the data, we end up with 668 distinct technological classes.   1.3.Research publications data The research article data come from the SCImago Journal & Country Rank portal5. The portal contains information on data available in the Scopus database and disaggregates the scientific fields into 313 specific categories according to Scopus Classification. For a given year, we set each country-research category pair to be equal to 0 if there were less than 3 documents, or if the number of citations of the documents published in the past four years was less than 400 (average of 100 citations per year). Also, each year we remove from the analysis each research category which had less than 30 publications.            4 2. Regression analysis setup 2.1. Individual regressions setup In order to assess the ability of each dimension to explain variations in economic growth, income inequality and greenhouse gas emissions, we estimate period fixed effects panel regression models of the form 𝑦!" = 𝑏# + 𝒂𝑻𝑋!" + 𝑏𝐸𝐶𝐼!"% + 𝜇" + 𝑒!" , where 𝑦!"  is the dependent variable (economic growth, income inequality or extent of greenhouse gas emissions) for country 𝑐  in year 𝑡 , 𝑏#  is the intercept term, 𝑋!"  is a vector of control independent variables that account for observed factors that are not related with the economic complexity. The coefficient 𝑏 is of particular interest to us as it is an estimate of the marginal effect of the economic complexity of the country in dimension 𝑑. The 𝜇" coefficient are period fixed effects that help to control for any unobserved factors that are period-specific and apply to all countries, and 𝑒!" is the error term.  2.2.Interactions regressions setup To infer how different forms of output (trade, technology, and research) combine to help explain geographic variations in economic growth, income inequality, and greenhouse gas emissions, we resort to three different specifications of interaction regression analyses. In the first specification, we assume that there is no interaction between the dimensions and that they share an additive relationship in explaining the economic outcome. The regression form of this specification is 𝑦!" = 𝑏# + 𝒂𝑻𝑋!" +0𝑏%𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%%+	𝜇" + 𝑒!" , Where 𝑑 is a superscript used to differentiate between trade ECI, technology ECI, and research ECI. We conduct four different no-interaction regressions, depending on which dimensions are  5 included in the analysis. They are 1) trade and technology, 2) trade and research, 3) technology and research, and 4) trade, technology, and research. In the second setup, we study the pairwise relationship between two dimensions 𝑑&and 𝑑'. This specification includes the interaction term between the two dimensions and is formally written as 𝑦!" = 𝑏# + 𝒂𝑻𝑋!" + 𝑏&𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%! +	𝑏'𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%" +	𝑏&'𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%! × 𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%" + 𝜇" + 𝑒!" . The interaction coefficient 𝑏&' allows us to infer how the two dimensions combine in explaining the variations of growth, inequality, or emission intensity.  Specifically, if 𝑏&' is significant and has the same sign as 𝑏&  and 𝑏' , then it is said that the two dimensions are complements in explaining the economic outcome (economic growth, income inequality, or greenhouse gas emissions). If 𝑏&'  is significant and negative then the dimensions are substitutes, and if it is insignificant then there is no relationship between the dimensions. Given that we investigate the performance of three dimensions of economic complexity, we end up doing three pairwise regressions: 1) trade and technology, 2) trade and research, and 3) technology and research interactions. In the third specification, we study the three-way interaction between every dimension. In this case, the regression is specified as 𝑦!" = 𝑏# + 𝒂𝑻𝑋!" + 𝑏&𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%! +	𝑏'𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%" +	𝑏(𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%! 																																															+ 	𝑏&'𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%! × 𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%" 	+ 	𝑏&(𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%! × 𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%# 	+ 	𝑏'(𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%" × 𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%#+	𝑏&'(𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%! × 𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%" × 𝐸𝐶𝐼!"%# + 𝜇" + 𝑒!" . In this specification if 𝑏)* and 𝑏)*+ are significant and have the same sign as 𝑏) and 𝑏*, then it is said that dimensions 𝑘 and 𝑙 are complements in explaining the economic outcome (economic growth, income inequality, or greenhouse gas emissions). Otherwise, their relationship is dependent on the third dimension 𝑚  and may range from complementary to substitute or no relationship.  6 To compare the performances of different models, we use the coefficient of determination 𝑅', a standard measure for the explanatory power of a model. It’s magnitude ranges between 0 and 1, with higher values implying that one can predict a higher amount of the variation in the dependent variable from the independent variables. We select the model that has the highest 𝑅' and in which every included complexity metric is significant as the multidimensional ECI model.                     7 3. Robustness check setup We check the robustness of the multidimensional economic complexity regression model in explaining variations in two different ways.  First, we add 1) the log of the population and 2) the log of the initial human capital to the regressions. These variables may affect the dependent variable but are not related with the complexity of the economy. Second, we compare the multidimensional economic complexity regression model to alternate models that account for the intensity and concentration of production, and to alternate models for economic complexity.  3.1. Additional explanatory variables robustness check setup We add three possible additional explanatory variables to the regression specification (separately and together): 1) the log of the population, 2) the log of the initial human capital, and 3) the log of natural resource exports per capita to the regressions.  The first variable, the log of the initial population is our measure for the “size” of the economy. The data for this variable are taken from
