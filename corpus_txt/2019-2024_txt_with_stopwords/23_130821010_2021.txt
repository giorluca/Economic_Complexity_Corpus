Inoua Chapman University inoua@chapman.edu This version: 20211  Abstract. The conventional view on economic development simplifies a country’s production to one aggregate variable, GDP. Yet product diversification matters for economic development, as recent, data-driven, “economic complexity” research suggests. A country’s product diversity reflects the country’s diversity of productive knowhow, or “capabilities”. Researchers derive from algorithms (inspired by network theory) measures of the number of capabilities in an economy, notably the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), argued to predict economic growth better than traditional variables such as human capital; and the country Fitness index, argued to remedy limitations of the ECI. This paper offers an alternative economic complexity measure (founded on information theory) that derives from a simple model of production as a combinatorial process whereby a set of capabilities combine with some probability to transform raw materials into a product. A country’s number of capabilities is given by the logarithm of its product diversity, as predicts the model, which also predicts a linear dependence between log-diversity, ECI, and log-fitness. The model’s predictions fit the empirical data well; its informational formulation, we argue, is a natural, unifying, theoretical framework for the complexity view on economic development. Keywords: economic growth, economic development, product diversification, economic complexity metrics. 1 Thoroughly updated version, using more recent data and containing a comment (Subsection 2.3) on the orthogonality between economic complexity and product diversity, as discussed in the recent literature. 2  1 Background 1.1 Product Diversification Matters for Economic Development  Contrary to a long tradition in economics according to which international prosperity is achieved when national economies specialize, product diversity is strongly correlated with economic development [1-6]. The “richest” countries make almost all types of products, from the most rudimentary to the most sophisticated ones; while the “poorest” countries make comparatively fewer and more rudimentary products (Table 1).2    Table 1. The World’s Most and Least Diversified Economies (2018, 4-digit HS).3 Country Diversification Rank Country Diversification RankUnited States 1224 1 Gambia 180 162China   1221 2 Maldives 178 163India 1219 3 Saint Lucia 169 164Japan   1211 3 Equat.

More generally, natural resources (or naturally occurring goods or raw materials) will play a special  2 Small-population Islands tend to have the lowest product diversification; so, we regroup them in Table 1 (otherwise, the bottom 10 will mostly include island countries). 3 See data description and source in Subsection 4.1. The number of products a country makes depends of course on the product nomenclature used (usually 2, 4, or 5-digit product codes), notably the SITC (Standard International Trade Classification) and the HS (Harmonized System). The results from the two product nomenclatures and at different aggregation levels are very similar; hence we present no systematic comparison of the results based on product nomenclature. 3      role throughout the analysis: they are the main source of bias in this purely qualitative view on production.   Figure 1. Countries’ GDP versus Diversification ranking (4-digit HS). Red countries are countries with exporters with natural-resource rents (averaged across years) at least 10% of their GDP.4   These associations are not just correlations and can be explained from a basic combinatorial model of production.5 The complexity of a country’s production (the diversity and sophistication of its products) reveals a diversity of productive knowledge in that economy that combine to make various products. Qualitatively, products differ precisely by the amount of knowledge involved in their production, the spectrum of which runs from zero, for naturally occurring goods (a natural  4 Throughout the straight lines are OLS (ordinary least square) fits.  5 The model is based entirely on the basic intuition that knowledge comes in discrete units, and it expands combinatorially. Other, more sophisticated, combinatorial models of production have been offered in the literature [7-9].  4      resource sold in the raw, for example), to a maximum value when all the available knowhows are involved in the making of the product (consider an aircraft, for example). A product’s (technological) sophistication or complexity can be defined by the amount of knowledge its production requires; and the (technological) complexity of an economy, by the total amount of knowledge involved in its output. But what precisely is an “amount of productive knowledge”, and how can we measure it?                         1.2 Productive Knowledge in Conventional Growth Models In conventional economic theory, a country’s productive knowledge is summarized by an aggregate production function GDP=Y=F(C, L), or the aggregate output Y (or income) that can be produced from any combination of aggregate labor and capital (C, L), where the function F is homogenous of degree 1, so that income per capita is a function of the stock of capital per worker: Y/L=F(C/L, 1).6 But as Solow’s seminal contribution established [10, 11], capital and labor accumulation cannot account for much of economic growth, which Solow explains in terms of exogenous shifts of the production function F through a multiplicative factor A (later named “Total Factor Productivity”), whose growth rate is interpreted as technological progress. Much of later development in conventional growth development theory is to give theoretical substance and identity to this “Solow residual” (in other words, to endogenize the part of economic development not explained by the level of physical capital per worker, C/L), the consensus being that A somehow captures productive knowledge or “technology”, often identified with human capital (years of schooling), innovation, or research and development [12-15]. 1.3 The Complexity View on Economic Development In contrast to the aggregate production function approach is the above-mentioned, data-driven, “complexity” approach to economic development inspired by the  6 Capital is traditionally denoted in economic theory as K, which we reserve for “knowledge”. 5      empirical correlation between economic development and product diversification. The diversity of a country’s production, as noted above, reflects the diversity of its capabilities (elemental units of productive knowhows), which combine to make more and more sophisticated products.  Figure 2. Network Model of Production. Countries make products using capabilities: (A) The country-capability-product network. (B) The country-product network. Capabilities are not directly observable: How to count them?  Thus, it should be possible to infer the amount of productive knowledge involved in an economy from its product diversification data. Researchers framed this problem in terms of network theory, modeling countries’ productions as a tripartite network connecting countries to the products they make, products to the capabilities they production requires, and countries to the capabilities they possess (Figure 2). Thus, the core problem of the network approach to production was conceived as one of reconstructing the partly unobservable country-product-capability network from its empirically observed bipartite country-product projection [16, 17]. Researchers conceived algorithms to that effect, notably the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), which, as the authors argue, predict economic growth better than traditional variables such as human capital [16, 17]. The ECI is jointly computed with the Product Complexity Index (PCI) by an algorithm akin to 6      that which the web search engine Google uses to rank webpages.7Another algorithm produces alternative country and product complexity measures [20], named country Fitness (F) and product Quality (Q). Both algorithms will be presented shortly. (Section 4 offers a step-by-step derivation od the metrics and the basic logic underlying them, for the reader not familiar with this literature.)8  The primary data of the network view on production is formally, the country-product binary matrix [ ]cpMM  connecting countries to the products they make: 1cpM  if country c  makes product ,p  and 0,cpM otherwise; this simple product list data is not available, however; thus, one takes as proxy for countries’ product lists, the countries’ export lists. (More on the data description in Subsection 4.1.) Given the matrix M , the product diversity of country c (the number of its products) and the ubiquity of product p  (the number of its producers):9    c cppD M  (1)  .p cpcU M  (2) The complexity metrics are (up to scaling) the solutions to the equations:  ,c c cp ppD ECI M PCI  (3)  .p p cp ccU PCI M ECI  (4)  .c cp pcF M Q  (5)  1 1[ ] .c cp ccQ M F  (6)  7 More precisely the ECI-PCI algorithm is more similar in spirit to an algorithm developed by J. Kleinberg [18, 19] and used by Ask.com. 8 The complexity metrics are analyzed in various studies, some of which offer critiques, alternatives, or refinements of the metrics, including the one presented here, in an earlier draft [21-26].  9 The natural concept is not ubiquity per se, but its inverse, which can be called product rarity. 7  2 Results and Discussions 2.1 Measuring How Smart an Economy Is by Counting Its Products The basic idea behind the combinatorial model of production is very simple. First, a product is some transformed natural resources, some raw materials to which is applied a set of knowhows to turn them into an economically valuable outcome. Second, and more fundamentally, knowledge comes in discrete elementary units, or bits or capabilities, that combine to make more and more sophisticated knowledge. Therefore, a country possessing K  capabilities can make potentially up to 2KD  products, whose sophistications range from zero for natural resources (sold in the raw) to K. Thus, the total amount of knowhow K involved in a country’s production is given by the country’s log-diversification (up to a scaling constant). However, not any random combination of capabilities makes sense as a coherent set of productive knowledge; yet it is easy to show (Subsection 4.4) that the basic conclusion still holds if we assume more realistically that a set of S  capabilities combine only with probability S  to transform a raw material into a valuable product: thus, a product’s technological sophistication is measured by the product’s probability of occurrence, or log-ubiquity. Moreover, one can show (Subsection 4.2) that the number of capabilities in an economy that makes D  product is    log( ),log(1 )DK  (7) The combinatorial model predicts the following relationships between the three country’s output complexity measures that fit the data well (Figure 3-Figure 4):10  log mean(log ).std(log )D DECID (8)  log log.mean(log ) mean(log )F DF D (9)  10 “Std” stands for standard deviation. The metrics are systematically compared in standardized form (namely their z-scores) in the figures below, unless otherwise indicated by the scale of the plot.  8        Figure 3. The Three Complexity Measures Related: Data vs Model Prediction. (Top panel: 4-digit SITC; Bottom Panel: 2-digit HS.)  9       Figure 4. LogDiversity vs ECI (top) vs LogFitness (bottom). (2-digit HS) 10      The fit is better for log-fitness, due to a few outliers of the ECI versus log-diversity: these outliers are island countries [iso codes marked in Figure 3, bottom panel, (a)], exporting mostly raw products (naturally occurring goods). More specifically (Subsection 4.5), the model predicts the following relationships between knowhow, diversity, complexity, sophistication, fitness, and quality, assuming the two algorithms (3)-(6) accurately measure these variables (where  is a positive constant,  being the model’s core parameter introduced earlier):   (1 ) ,KD  (10)  (1 ) ,KF  (11)  ,SQ  (12)  mean( ),std( )K KECIK (13)  mean( ).std( )S SPCIS (14)  2.2 Informational Interpretation of the Model The model has a natural informational interpretation, which seems to be the natural language for the complexity view on economic development more generally. In the language of information theory [27], a country’s log-diversification measures the knowledge content of its output (that is, the total amount of nonredundant information needed to encode all the knowledge required to make its products). In other words, log-diversity as a measure of knowhow can also be derived from a purely probabilistic, informational, argument.  Think of a country’s product as an event (or message) revealing information about the country’s (unobserved) productive knowledge endowment. As suggests Shannon’s theory, the amount of information thus revealed is given (up to a 11      norming constant) by the log-probability of the event (here, the realization of a product with unknown knowledge sophistication):                                   Information Log .Probability1  If we think of a country as the message source and assume the events (products) are equally likely, then the knowledge (or information) content of a country’s output is simply measured by the logarithm of the number of messages (products) it sends (namely, its log-product-diversity). If, on the other hand, we think of the world as the message source, and still assume uniform probability, then the relevant probability of an event (product) is the product’s ubiquity divided by the total number of countries, denoted C below: hence a product’s knowledge content (or sophistication) is given by its log-inverse-ubiquity, or log-rarity. The assumption of uniform probability is clearly a simplification; and so is also the implicit assumption that a product likelihood of occurrence is a function solely of the technology its production requires, which is not always the case, particularly for natural resources, whose rarity (the inverse of ubiquity) has more to do with exogenous, geological reasons, than knowhow. One can show that the bias of log-diversity due to raw materials is relatively small, since a country can buy from other countries the raw materials it needs (Subsection 4.4); but the correction of log-rarity for the bias due to raw materials can be more significant, as we now emphasize more explicitly. The probability of a country’s making a product of technological sophistication S  (or S-product for short) is more precisely, the probability that 
the country possesses all the required skillset, multiplied by the probability that the country possesses (or can acquire) the natural resources required as raw material:  prob( -product) prob(raw materials).SS  (15) Thus, a product’s sophistication is given (up to a multiplicative constant fixing the unit of measurement of product sophistication) by the formula: 12       logprob( -product) logprob(raw materials).S S  (16) If we assume homogeneity of the world economy as regards production (that is, countries differ only by their technologies and natural-resource endowments), then the same probabilities extend to the world economy viewed as sample space. Thus, the probability of making a product can be estimated by its log-inverse-ubiquity corrected by the log-likelihood of finding the needed raw materials: thus, according to the model, the sophistication of a product can be empirically measured as follows:   Sophistication(Product) logUbiquity(Product) logUbiquity(Raw Materials). The needed data for the raw-material correction is the input-output binary matrix   '1, '  is input to ,0, otherwise.ppp pA  (17) Then an empirical measure of product sophistication is  ' ''''log log ,p pp pp ppppU A USC A C (18) where C  is the number of countries. We could not implement and assess at this point this adjustment for the bias related to raw materials, lacking the input-output data at a sufficiently detailed level.  The complexity algorithms (3)-(6), on the other hand, can be viewed as alternative ways of correcting diversity and ubiquity for the just-mentioned bias, as suggested by the intuition that a country’s knowhow is reflected in the products it makes, and, vice versa, a product reflects the knowhow of the countries making it.  13       Figure 5. The three product sophistication measures related. (Top panel: 2-digit HS; bottom panel: 4-digit HS: outlier Products are mostly raw products.)  As anticipated, log-product-rarity is a biased estimate of product sophistication as regards natural resources or raw products (Figure 5). A closer look (in terms of more detailed product level, say 5-digit code) reveals the following rudimentary goods, 14      which tend to top the sophistication ranking nonetheless: meat of animals such as cetaceans, primates and reptiles; chemicals like thallium, aldrin, and chlordane; cotton yarn; etc. Disregarding these, we get to warships, vessels, spacecrafts (including satellites), nuclear reactors, rail locomotives, tramways, machines for making optical fibers, aircrafts, etc. These are most likely among the most sophisticated products. To some extent, the bias exists also for PCI and Q, though it is reduced, if, as is common in the literature, we include in a country’s product list only those products of which the country is a significant exporter (in the sense of having in these products a high ‘revealed comparative advantage’: see Subsection 4.1). In contrast, we choose in this paper to center entirely on the qualitative dimension of production, and avoid the greater bias of treating a country as a nonproducer of a product just because it does not export a large quantity of it. 2.3 Diversity and Complexity are Orthogonal, but Not Independent Diversity and complexity are intuitively dependent notions.11 The model predicts that product diversity is an exponential function of economic complexity. One can show mathematically that the dependence cannot be a linear one anyway, at least if complexity is measured by the ECI, or more precisely its non-standardized version (an eigenvector associated with the country-product network: see Subsection 4.2), which we denote 2k . This follows from a basic yet elegant mathematical result [22], establishing orthogonality of 2k  and the product diversity vector, which we denote [ ]cDd . By symmetry one can similarly establish orthogonality between product ubiquity [ ]pUu  and the non-standardized PCI, which we denote 2s .  Contrary to a spreading interpretation [22, 23, 26], however, orthogonality between the two vectors, be it reminded, merely implies that the two vectors are not linearly dependent (where linearity is to be taken in the strict mathematical sense, which  11 This subsection is an interlude suggested by a growing, yet erroneous, interpretation of the orthogonality between complexity and diversity that seems to call into question their very dependence, and is therefore likely to slightly misdirect research in this field.  15      excludes affine dependence, or inclusion of an intercept). Orthogonality of complexity and diversity is not incompatible with positive dependence between the two vectors: to the contrary, the orthogonality combined with the positive dependence merely put a constraint on average complexity. Thus 20k d  and 20s u  combined with 2cov( , ) 0k d  and 2cov( , ) 0s u  (which by now should be taken as well-established both empirically and theoretically) simply imply that  2mean( ) 0.k  (19)  2mean( ) 0.s  (20) Since the orthogonality is true mathematically, the sign condition (19)-(20) simply reflects the dependence between complexity and diversity, which is strong as we already know, and which the sign conditions singly confirm (Figure 6). 16       Figure 6. Distribution of the (non-standardized) ECI and PCI. Top: Country Complexity. Bottom: Product Complexity. (2-digit HS). 17      2.4 World Distribution of Knowhow and Product Sophistication  One can show both theoretically and empirically (Figure 7) that the world distribution of knowhow is Beta-distributed (up to discreteness).12     Figure 7. World Distribution of Knowhow as Measured by the Three (Standardized) Complexity Metrics (HS-2 level). The shape of this distribution has a series of important implications for economic development that we only sketch in this paper (see Summary, Section 3). But as regards the world distribution of product sophistication, one can show that combinatorial nature of knowhow expansion in each country is more important than the shape of the distribution of knowhow across countries. Thus, for mathematical simplicity and for easy implementation, we will simplify the world distribution of knowhow to a uniform distribution (an extreme, degenerate, case of a Beta distribution):  12 Theoretically, the intuition is that knowledge expands in a self-reinforcing manner (a “rich get richer” effect, which is not strong enough, however, to induce extreme variability of knowhow, as would exhibit a Pareto distribution, for example). Technically, knowhow expansion can be modeled as a Polya urn process.  18       maxmax1prob( |World) , 0,1,...., .1K K KK (21) Under this simplification, the model predicts the following world distribution of product sophistication (the probability of producing a product with sophistication ,S  all countries combined):                                max1ma1x1prob( |World) , 0,1,..., ,( )KSSS C S K  (22) (See Subsection 4.5.3 below for the mathematical derivation and the procedure adopted in the next figure to fit the theoretical distribution to the data.) This distribution fits the data quite well (Figure 8).       19       Figure 8. World Distribution of Product Sophistication: Data versus Model Fit.    20  3 Summary: What Have We Learned? A country is rich either by its product diversity (or its sum of productive knowhow), or by the intensity of its production (the purely quantitative aspect of production not treated in this paper). A country’s productive knowhow can be simply measured by the country’s log-product-diversification. This purely qualitative view on production derives from the basic intuition that knowledge comes discretely and expands combinatorially. And its predictions match the data well.  However, it is a curious fact that the world distribution of knowhow has the shape it has (an increasing probability function), which suggests a relatively mild cross-country variation of productive knowhow: higher levels of productive knowhow tend to be more frequent. This suggests that a non-neglectable portion of the cross-country income disparity cannot be accounted for in terms of a similarly large disparities of productive knowhow: there is at least a threshold beyond which economic development involves other determinants than knowhow.13        13 This important point, and more generally the economic implications of the model, is postponed to a follow-up paper, which contains a growth accounting in terms of the two dimensions of production (diversity and intensity of output), sketched in an earlier draft of this paper, but that expanded in subtlety. 21  4 Method: Data and Model  4.1 Data In principle, the complexity view on growth requires very simple and accessible data (for each country, the list of products it makes), which are not yet available, however; thus, researchers take as proxy for countries’ product lists, the countries’ export lists. While there will inevitably be some error in centering the analysis on export data (for lack of detailed data on production), the bias has proved minor a posteriori, given the accuracy of the results: apparently, a country’s export mix is representative of its total output’s composition. The results presented throughout this paper are based on the proxy matrix:  1 if 0,0 if X 0,cpcpcpXM   (23) where cpX  is the amount country c  exported in product ,p  using the Comtrade data in HS (revision 2007), available for the years 1995-2018 [28].14 We also use for comparison the Comtrade data in SITC (revision 2) as compiled and corrected for mistakes by Feenstra et al. and available for the years 1962-2000 [29].  Unlike in this paper, the standard practice in the economic complexity literature is to define the matrix M  more restrictively as    1, 1,0, 1,cpcpcpRCAMRCA (24)  14 The trade data is accessible, e.g., through the CEPII (Centre d’études prospectives et d’informations internationales): http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=37; or the Atlas of Economic Complexity Dataverse (Harvard University): https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/atlas. The income data are countries’ GDP in PPP (purchasing power parity) from the Penn World Table (PWT8); we use the RGDPO variable (an output-oriented GDP estimate), though the other measures give very similar results). The PWT is accessible through the GGDC (Groningen Growth and Development Centre, University of Groningen): https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/.  22      where cpRCA is the revealed comparative advantage of a country c in product p and is defined as  ( / ) / ( / ).cp cp cp cp cpp c cpX X XRCA X  (25) 4.2 The ECI-PCI Algorithm The ECI-PCI algorithm [16, 17] assumes that an economy’s (technological) complexity is proportional to the average complexity of its products, and, vice versa, the complexity of a product is proportional to the average complexity of its producers. Thus, if cK  is the complexity of country c, and ,pS  the complexity of product p, then    ,c cp ppK W S   (26)    * ,p pc cpS W K  (27) where  and  are positive normalizing constants, and the weights   ,cpcpcppMWM (28)  * .pcpcpccMWM (29) Collecting the variables and weights into the vectors and matrices [ ],cKk [ ],pSsW [ ],cpW and *[ ]pcWW , (26) and (27) become k Ws  and * .s W k  So we get  1*( ) ( ) .WW k k  (30)  1*( ) ( ) .W W s s  (31) That is, the complexities of countries and products are given by eigenvectors of *WW and * ,W W respectively, associated with the eigenvalue 1( ) .  Because the averaging weights sum to 1, it is easy to see that any (positive) uniform vectors 23      [ ,..., ]TK Kk and s [ ,..., ]TS S are solutions to this eigenvector problem; these are the eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalue, which is 1 (by a known linear algebra result, the Perron-Frobenius theorem). Thus, the authors of this algorithm choose the eigenvectors associated with the second largest eigenvalue. Let 2k and2s be the second eigenvectors. Then ECI and PCI are (up to the sign) the elements of the chosen eigenvectors given in standardized form:   2 222mean( )ECI sign[corr( , )] ,std( )k kk dk (32)  2 222mean( )PCI sign[corr( , )] .std( )s ss us (33) We multiply by the signed correlation of the eigenvectors with country diversification vector d  and product ubiquity vector ,u  respectively, to ensure the signs are correct; this is simply because the sense of an eigenvector being arbitrary, the standardization specifies the metrics only up to the sign: for example, any chosen eigenvector k  is equivalent to any nonzero multiples ,k  so that  mean( ) mean( ).std( ) | | std( )k k k kk k  (34) 4.3 The Fitness-Quality Algorithm In essence, this algorithm [20] measures the complexity of an economy by the total complexity of its products; and the complexity of a product, by the product’s inverse ubiquity, multiplied by the harmonic mean of the complexities of the producers. That is, the two metrics are jointly computed recursively as follows:       ( )( 1)( )1,mean( )nnpn cpc ppQMFQ  (35)     ( 1)( )( )1 1.1mean( )nnpccp nccQF MF  (36) 24      The means are averages across all countries and all products, respectively, and the initial conditions are unit complexities for all countries and all products. The algorithm converges to a fix-point ( ) ( )( , )F Q , which, in normalized form, define the country Fitness and product Quality indices:   ( )( ),mean( )FFF (37)  ( )( ).mean( )QQQ  (38) The crucial novelty of this algorithm is the following ingenious observation: if a low-complexity country is among the producers of a product, this product is necessarily a low-sophistication product; but to know that a highly complex economy is among the producers of a product barely reveals any information about the product’s complexity (since such country makes almost all product types). Thus, highly complex economies should be discounted in the measure of product complexity, dominated by the more informative, lowest-complexity, producer: this is precisely what a harmonic mean does.  It is easy to show that [up to the final normalization in (37) and (38)]:  mean( | ),mean( )c cQ cF DQ (39)  mean ( | ) 1,mean( )HppF pQF U (40) where the mean in the numerator of (39) is country c’s (arithmetic) average product quality; and that in the numerator of (40), the harmonic-average fitness of product p’s producers. (The means in the denominators are the unconditional counterparts, the averages across all countries and all products.) We will use similar notations below. Thus, F and Q are generalized diversity and inverse-ubiquity measures 25      corrected for potential biases, notably that related to raw materials.15 As mentioned above (Subsection 4.3), the crucial adjustment pertains to Q and was made possible by use of the harmonic mean, whose following bounds are known:16                               min{ | } mean ( | ) min{ | }.H p cF p F p U F p   4.4 Model Assume, to begin with, the following two assumptions:  1. There is no shortage of raw materials in any country (knowhow, in other words, is the only constraint on production).   2. The probability that some unit of knowhow applies to some raw material is a constant ,  anything considered.  By the first assumption (relaxed below), the probability of making an S-sophistication product (or S-product for short) is the same as the probability that S units of knowhow make sense as a coherent productive skillset that can be used to transform raw materials into a product. By the second assumption, this is:  prob( -Product) .SS   (41) For a country that possesses K capabilities (K-country for short), there are ( )KS possible S-collections of skillsets, among which only a proportion given by S  can be used to make products. Therefore, a K-country can make a total number of products   0(1 ) .( )KSSK S KD   (42) The model’s first assumption comes down to assuming that natural resources are infinitely abundant, and uniformly so, across the Earth, which is clearly not the case.  15 For example if ,pQ Q for every ,p then ;c cF D and if ,cF F for every ,c  then pQ 1 / .pU  16 See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean.  26      Throughout, therefore, the results were biased owing to natural resources. The natural-resource constraint on production can be included as follows. The probability of making an S-product is the probability thatS 
knowhows make sense as a product in a given country multiplied by the probability that the country possesses the needed raw materials to transform with the knowhow, which we assumed equals 1 previously, but which we now assume to be more realistically some function ( ) 1.S  So now we have   prob( -Product) ( ) .SS S  (43) In other words, we have (up to norming):  logprob( -Product) log ( ).S S S  (44) As for diversification adjusted for natural-resource constraint, it is now  ( ).( ) sSKSD S  (45) Define the average probability to which a country finds the needed raw materials for its technology as  ( ).( )( )SSSSKSKSS (46) Then the country’s product diversification is  (1 ) .KD  (47)  In other words,  log log.log(1 )DK  (48) Correcting log-diversity for natural resource constraint is therefore straightforward in principle. In the sequel, D  stands for the unadjusted diversity.  27      4.5 Model’s Predictions about the Complexity Algorithms  4.5.1 Model’s Prediction about ECI  As usual we index an empirical country and product by c and p, and we index the theoretical counterparts by K and S, respectively, and refer to them as K-country and S-product. A K-country makes (1 )K  products among which ( )KsS  are S-products; so the distribution of product sophistication in a K-country is   prob( | ) ,(1 )( )KK SSS K 0,..., .S K  (49) The average product sophistication in a K-country is                                                     0( | )           (by definition)prob( | ) KSS K S S K                                                           1(1(1))K SSKKSS                                                           1111     (by a known identity)1(( ))K SSKKSKSS                                                          11 111( )( )KSK SSKK                                                   101           (by setting 1))(1 )(  KK XXK XK X S                                                           1(1 ) .(1 )KKK That is,   | )( .1S K K  (50) This theoretical result justifies the measurement of a country’s output complexity by its average product complexity (up to a scaling constant): it explains why ECI works as a measure of knowhow. We can check the extent to which the ECI-PCI algorithm does effectively estimate a country’s knowhow as follows. Let the estimated country’s complexity as measured by the ECI-PCI algorithm be written as   (2) (2)mean( | ),cK S c  (51) 28      where (2)cK  is thc  entry of the country complexity eigenvector 2k  and (2) |S c  is the restriction of the product sophistication eigenvector 2s to products made by country .c  If product complexity S is accurately measured by 2s  (which it can do only up to the scale of measurement of sophistication, and an error term that should average out), then there is a constant  0  such that  (2) error.S S  (52) And if in addition the combinatorial model of production is accurate, then the ECI-PCI algorithm yields ancECI that is as an estimate of the theoretical counterpart  log (log )( ).std( ) std(log )D DK KECIK D (53)  4.5.2 Model’s Prediction about Fitness  It follows from (39) and (40) that F and Q are generalized diversity and inverse-ubiquity measures, correcting for the potential bias related to raw materials (or natural resources).17 Thus, according to the model’s informational interpretation (Subsection 2.2), the complexity measures are more precisely log(F) and log(Q), as confirm the Results throughout (Section 2).  More specifically, if the F-Q algorithm is accurate, then logQ  is a good measure of product sophistication S  (up to scaling); that is, there is 0  such that  .SQ  (54) Moreover, the model predicts that the average product quality in a K-country is                                  0( | ) prob( | )K SSQ K S K    17 For example if ,pQ Q for every ,p then ;c cF D and if ,cF F for every ,c  then pQ 1 / .pU  29                                                           0((1 ) .)K SSSKKS                            That is,  (1 ) 1( | ) ( ) .1KKQ KD (55) Therefore, the F-Q algorithm produces a fitness index, namely (up to scaling)                                            mean( | ) ,c cF Q c D  which is an estimate of the theoretical counterpart:  (1 ) .KF    (56) 4.5.3 Predicted Distribution of Product Sophistication The model, recall, represents countries theoretically as indexed by their amount of knowhow, K. Let prob( |World)K  be the theoretical distribution of productive knowhow across countries, and denote its support as max{0,1,..., }.K  All K-countries combined make a total number of products given by                                     max0(1 ) ( 1)prob( |World)K kkK K ,  among which                                         maxmax0( 1)prob( |World)( )KKK SS K K  are S-products. Thus, the theoretical world distribution of product sophistication is   maxmax0max0prob( |World)prob( |World) , 0,..., .prob( |World)(1( ))K SKKKKSKKS S KK (57) Under a uniform knowhow distribution, (57) simplifies to  maxmax0max0prob( |World) , 0,..., .(1( ))KKSK SK KKS S K  (58) This formula simplifies further by the known identity:                                                    maxmax011( ) ( ).KKKSKS  30      Thus we get (up to norming):                                           max11max1prob( |World) 0,..., .( ),KSSS S K   (59) where the omitted norming constant is the denominator in (57), max 1 1[(1 ) 1] .K   If we treat the world economy, consisting of C countries and P products (according to a given nomenclature), as a sample realization of the theoretical sample space, and denote the estimation operator by a hat, then we have:  maxmean( ) ,2KK  (60)  maxmaxlog,log(1 )DK  (61)  maxmaxˆlogˆ 1.ˆ1 log(1 )DCKC (62) Only the last expression, equation (62), is new, given what was said so far: the correction is suggested by the minimum-variance unbiased estimation of the maximum of a (discrete) uniform distribution. 18 We fitted the theoretical distribution (59) to the empirical data (Figure 10 and Figure 11) by first estimating the model’s core parameter ,  taking into consideration the fact that K is an integer: thus an estimate of  is obtained as solution to the problem:  20 1log logmin mean round .log(1 ) log(1 )D D (63) Then, given the numerically found solution ˆ ,  we estimate maxK̂ from (62).19   18 This is more famously referred to as “German tank problem”. Wikipedia offers a nice introduction on this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution.  19 We did not carry further the analysis of the fit, because the uniform distribution is just a simplification, and one can show that only the product is truly determinate: various choices of   that preserve this product yield essentially the same fit.  31  References  [1] F.
