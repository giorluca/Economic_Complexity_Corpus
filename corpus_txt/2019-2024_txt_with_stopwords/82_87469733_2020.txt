Alessandro Ceccarelli, University of Cambridge  Abstract This thesis explores the technological choices made by rural communities of the Indus Civilisation (c.2600-1900BC) by analysing ceramic materials from three villages in north-west India. The Indus Civilisation has typically been characterised as a society that underwent a broadly homogeneous development, and continuity and transformations of ceramic industries have previously been studied through the use of relatively simplified models of diffusion. The small number of large-scale settlements that are referred to as cities have typically been used to characterise the technological, social and cultural behaviours across the vast zone occupied by Indus Civilisation populations. Within this region, the processes of urbanisation and deurbanisation are much debated, and it has been suggested that climate change played a role in socio-cultural transformations. However, rural dynamics, including lifestyles, craft production and knowledge-scapes are often perceived as being marginal.  The rural settlements that have been studied are located at varying distances from large-scale sites, each showing a range of phases of occupation chronologically spanning from the early phases of Indus urban development, to the late urban and post-urban phases. The diversity of settlements has made it possible to explore the impact of societal and climatic changes on ceramic industries, and to assess how communities interacted with variable environments, as well as their technological transformations over time. Through the use of macroscopic and archaeometric analyses of pottery, integrated with ethno-archaeological observations, Indus ceramic traditions have been identified within the rural context. Here craft traditions are presented as a medium for understanding the functional variability of ceramics, as well as the variability of associated socio-cultural groups characterising each site. This approach has made it possible to reconstruct more diverse industries than previously thought, and offered a glimpse into synchronic Indus social networks among villages, as well as their diachronic transformations. The resulting picture suggests that rural social complexity and interactions facilitated the reproduction of a resilient, adaptable, yet mutating system of ceramic traditions. These traditions partially transformed during the Indus Civilisation’s phases of urbanisation and deurbanisation. Rural ceramic landscapes adapted to, and were enriched by broader variable social and physical environments, yet maintained their own characteristics and identities.       iii Acknowledgements   Guru Kumhar Sikh Kumbh Hai, Gadh Gadh Kadhe Khot Antar Hath Sahar De, Bahar Bahe Chot  The mentor is the potter, the student is the (unfired) pot, the mentor gives shape and cures the flaws with care,  always protecting with the palm from inside,  while beating the pot from outside.   Kabir, 15th century, Varanasi, India.   This thesis is part of a broader story of promises, passion and sacrifice. I lived, worked and travelled in India for many years, almost for a decade, which shaped most of my current life. The first time I visited India, I was a young man and I was seeking a new life, having overcome a series of personal difficulties, and was searching for meaning and discovery. I became a disciple of a Himalayan yogi, who for many years provided me with a quiet place to live, a method for healing my mind, a journey towards a new self, and a large family of volunteers and meditation practitioners. I made a constant effort to construct a happier, stronger and better version of myself, while he provided me with the methods to unpack, sharpen and calm my mind. During those beautiful years, I served others in a forest ashram near Pune, and I travelled across the subcontinent, assisting his charitable work, while working on myself.  India gave me so much, including a new, extended family, a healed mind, self-confidence, and a range of new skills. I wanted to give back, after all that had been given to me. Eventually, I promised myself I would reciprocate the countless gifts that India gave to me. I moved to London for my Master's on South Asian Archaeology, started and relinquished a first PhD at UCL, and then finally landed at University of Cambridge, where I started and completed this project. This was my own way of showing gratitude to the Hamsa Yoga Sangh charity, the Himalayan yogi Yogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath and Guruma Shivangini, and my friends in India, to whom this thesis is dedicated.  Second, I would like to thank my mentors, who managed to transform my passion for archaeology, material culture and South Asia into a professional asset. Figuratively, in Kabir’s words, they have shaped me from a raw lump of clay into a nicely-formed vessel over the course of this project. In particular, I am very grateful to Dr Cameron A. Petrie, my first supervisor, for two reasons. First of all, he trained and coped with an overly enthusiastic, stubborn and energetic Italian researcher for years, which is a complex task in itself. Secondly, he gave me the unique opportunity to join the ERC TwoRains team, which had a major impact on my personal life and career development. Similarly, I am extremely   iv grateful to Prof Charles A. I. French (University of Cambridge) and Dr Patrick S. Quinn (UCL IoA). Charly, my second supervisor, has been my main point of contact for broader conceptual questions and personal advice, but also for the daily work in the McBurney Geoarchaeology Laboratory. The same is true for Dr Tonko Rajkovaca, one of the pillars of the McBurney Laboratory and more broadly of the Department of Archaeology in Cambridge. Patrick, my external advisor, helped me become a specialist of material culture and ceramic studies, since the very early stages at UCL IoA. He provided me with the essential tools to secure a PhD position at Cambridge, but he has also constantly passed on cutting-edge analytical techniques to his students, as well as world-class knowledge that helped complete this journey.  I am deeply thankful to the Indian team of scholars and researchers at BHU, Banaras Hindu University, for their support and friendship. Prof. Ravindra Nath Singh, Dr. Dheerendra Pratap Singh and the whole team of PhD students and members of staff at BHU, including Dr Pushp Lata Singh, Dr Vikas Kumar Singh, Arun Kumar Pandey, Swtantra Singh, Sunil Singh, Sagorika Chakraborty, Aftab Alam, Neelam Singh, Arti Chowdhary, Amit Ranjan, Urvashi Singh, and Brij Mohan Yadav. Special thanks go to Dr Sudarshan Singh, a genuine friend and a great colleague at BHU.  I am also grateful to archaeologists Appu Singh Sharan (ASI and MDU, Rohtak) and Vikas Pawar (MDU, Rohtak) for their help, and to my Hindi teacher Virendra Singh-ji, who was one of the key figures that contributed the most to the success of my fieldwork in Varanasi. He welcomed me in his house for many months, I became close to his family, to the extent that I truly felt at home in Varanasi, between Assi Ghat and Nagwa oad.  There would be a long list of people and institutions that have significantly helped me in the past years during this journey. For instance, the support of the Nehru Trust at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Fitch Laboratory at the British School at Athens, Greece, and in particular the support of Dr Evangelia Kiriatzi, was essential. Evangelia showed me a different way of doing research when I got disillusioned with academia. Similarly, the encouragement and support of a number of people helped me reach this point, including Dr Silvia Amicone (Tubingen, Germany), Dr Carlotta Gardner, Dr Natalia Lozada Mendieta, Dr Gabriella Manna (MNAO 'Giuseppe Tucci’, Rome, Italy), Dr Robert Harding (UCL and University of Cambridge), Dr Daniela De Simone (British Museum, London), and Dr Julia Shaw (UCL). I am also grateful that the ethnographic research project submitted for assessment was approved by the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee, School of the Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Cambridge, School Research Ethics Committee, and the Department of Archaeology Ethics Committee, Cambridge. Similarly, the team at the Faculty of Earth Sciences and Geography was particularly kind and permitted the use of their kilns and Petro-Thin machine. In terms of politics and activism for social justice and minorities, which I undertook alongside my PhD, there are few people and charities that I would like to thank in particular. Professor Paul Dupree (Magdalene College, Cambridge) was an essential ally in fighting cases of misogyny, racism and homophobia in Cambridge. Similarly, the University of   v Cambridge Graduate Union and CUSU played a pivotal role over the past few years. Eventually, I found even more allies in Cambridge when I started my work as President of the Students' Union, which resulted in an even larger degree of support by a number of passionate students. Finally, as mentioned above, this was also a story of sacrifice. I am grateful to my families in Italy and Spain, to my father’s family and to my mother’s family, brothers and sisters, for their constant support. I love each of them every day, and I miss each of them every day. They have all played a role in this project at different stages, and their support was essential. In particular, I am grateful to my best friends, who are like my brothers, who have kept walking with me in the past 14 years, and keep supporting my crazy ideas: if I made it to the end of this journey, it is because of the constant help and support of Francesco Mangoni and Alberto Casu.   To all of them, my sincere gratitude.       vi Contents Preface declaration i Abstract   ii Acknowledgements   iiii Contents   vi Index of Figures  xv Index of Tables  xix Part One: Rationale, methods and materials 1 Chapter 1.

Wittgenstein 1953, §570     2 Chapter 1. One hundred years of Indus paradigm: thesis groundwork, aims and structure   1.1  Introduction  Technology and ceramic materials have been an essential part of societies for millennia. As part of daily life, crafts and technologies shape and are shaped by social identities, and are entangled with vital processes of resilience and cultural transformations. The actions of obtaining, reproducing and using crafts go beyond simple utilitarian or economic considerations, and allow humans to explore identities and interactions within and among communities. This is especially important during periods of transformation, when environmental and social changes endanger the sustainability of complex societies. The rediscovery of ancient crafts and technologies allows us to observe how communities organised their systems of production, transmitted their knowledge and skills through generations, organised their lives, and perceived themselves and others.  South Asia’s Indus Civilisation (c.3200-1300BC) has been often presented as one of the largest Bronze Age civilisations and a major Old World civilization (Childe 1950; Kenoyer 1998; Possehl 1999a; Wright 2010). Chronologically, it was broadly contemporaneous with the late Early Dynastic, Akkadian, and Ur III periods in Mesopotamia and the Old Kingdom and First Intermediate period in Egypt (Petrie 2019). Geographically, the area covered by Indus Civilisation settlements and material culture includes modern day Pakistan, northern India and Afghanistan, being a vast zone of c. a million square kilometres (Possehl 1997; 1999a). Since the rediscovery of Indus settlements almost one hundred years ago in 1920s (Marshall 1931; Piggott 1950; Wheeler 1950; 1968) and until recent times, the Indus Civilisation has been typically described as a vast, culturally homogeneous complex society dominated by five large-scale settlements. However, this small number of Indus large-scale settlements (c. 80+ ha), typically regarded as urban centres or cities, seem to have been the “exception rather than the norm” within the Indus zone, as the majority of identified settlements were smaller rural communities (Petrie 2019: 109). Within the vast Indus zone, settlements formed in diverse ecological niches, and under a wide variety of environmental   3 conditions, hydrological systems, and rainfall systems (Dixit et al. 2018; Orengo and Petrie 2017a; see Figure 1.1).  In the past few decades, there has been a gradual shift in the perception of the Indus social, cultural and economic organisation, where more regional variability and the role of rural communities have now taken a more pivotal role (Fairservis 1986; Petrie 2013; Petrie et al. 2017b; Possehl 2002; Weber 2003; Weber et al. 2010). However, little data is currently available to better characterise the rural systems of production in 
the Indus zone, including ceramic industries, the variability of associated socio-cultural groups, their regional expressions, and how they adapted and reacted to the many environmental and socio-political changes which occurred across the Indus Civilisation development trajectories.  This thesis aims to explore this issue by looking at rural crafts and technologies, and how ceramic traditions, producers and their associated social units transformed, interacted and adapted to local environmental and cultural changes during the expansion, pinnacle, and de-urbanisation processes of the Indus Civilisation (2500-1900BC). By using a multi-site dataset and a holistic approach, this thesis explores the diversity of ceramic traditions, the multi-layered identities of rural communities, and how the rural systems of production were organised and sustained. This project exists in its own, but it is also part of the current TwoRains project (see Figure 1.2), and indirectly contributes to the previous Land, Water, Settlement project, which investigate the impact of climate and environmental changes at the end of the Indus Civilisation urban period (Singh et al. 2010; 2011; 2018a; 2018b; Singh and Petrie 2009). The predominant focus of this project is devoted to materials from transitional phases identified at northwest Indian archaeological sites, more specifically from periods which took different names at different times of the archaeological research in the region. A consistent nomenclature has been adopted here, which follows (see Table 1.1):  - A Pre-Urban (c.3200-2600BC) to Early Urban transition, characterised by the early development of large-size settlements or Urban settlements;  - The Early-Urban and Late Urban phases (c.2600-1900BC), or Mature Harappan period, marked by the pinnacle of the first South Asian urban centres in modern Pakistan and India (e.g. Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, Rakhigarhi, Dholavira and Ganweriwala), and associated with the gradual aridification process and the weakening of the ISM in its Late Urban phase (Dixit et al. 2014; 2015; 2018b);   4  - The Late-Urban to Post-Urban period of the Indus Civilisation (c. 1900-1400 BCE), frequently associated with ceramic industries produced during the middle stage of the so-called Late Harappan in North-Western India, when urban centres are believed to have ‘collapsed’ or transformed, the monsoons aligned with modern patterns, and occupational strategies seem to have shifted towards exclusive rural, small-size settlements.   1.2 Research aims and methods  This thesis explores technological choices and ceramic traditions of people living at the study sites and how the urbanisation and deurbanisation processes of the Indus Figure 1.1 Indus and Painted Grey Ware sites. The red square indicates the interested region for the project (Bates et al. 2017a; 2017b; Possehl 1999a).    5 Civilisation affected them. As part of the broader ERC TwoRains project, the present project aims to the understand crafts and technologies at NW Indian sites which fall under the umbrella of the Indus Civilisation using ceramic materials as the main proxy. Pottery is particularly useful for archaeologists, not only due to the durability and abundance of ceramic artefacts in the archaeological record, but also for the vast range of approaches that can be applied to its study. For instance, technological ceramic analysis allows to explore both diachronic and synchronic variability of pottery assemblages taking into account ethno-archaeological and anthropological perspectives (Costin 2001; Dobres and Hoffman 1994, 200; Dobres and Robb 2000, 200; Sofaer 2015; Tite 1999). Such analysis is mainly based on a classification procedure known as the chaîne opératoire approach (see Martinón-Torres 2002), which helps to address questions about social choices related to variability of pottery production. On a synchronic level, technological and stylistic variability amongst sites in specific periods can be used for identifying villages’ and regional traditions, social relationships, and settlement functions (Roux 2011: 85; 2016); on a diachronic level, besides providing a broad chronological classification of traditions and wares, it can be useful for tracing phenomena of continuity and transformations of the chaînes opératoires. Such a vertical perspective may also provide details on how ancient communities transmitted their knowledge and on agencies which contributed to reproducing and innovating ceramic industries over time.  Issues regarding theoretical frameworks and interpretation schemes employed in archaeological ceramic analyses in South Asia will be addressed in detail in Chapters 2 and 3. For instance, observations on regional diversity and variability will be used to counter the widespread idea of homogeneous ceramic production across the Indus zone (see Chapter 2). This thesis aims to move away from the tendency to present narratives based on cultural histories and cultural evolutionary approaches (see Chapter 3.2); and the effects of simplistic evolutionary approches and demic diffusionism to rationalise changes and continuity of ceramic industries (see Chapter 3.2.2). Besides archaeological interpretation schemes, ethnographic observations on modern communities of craftspeople in South Asia have also been affected by old-fashioned approaches (see Chapter 3). For instance, the effects of the direct historical approach and of the tendencies to present parallel histories will be summarised, as well as their impact on our current understanding of ancient Indus tools, techniques and technologies (see Chapter 3.4.1).    6  Pre-urban period, Early Harappan, Regionalisation Era Kot Diji, Sothi-Siswal, Damb Sadaat, Tochi-Gomal phase, Amri-Nal 3200-2600BC Harappa Period 1;  Harappa Period 2 Pre -Early Urban transition,  Early-Mature Harappan Transition  2600-2500BC Harappa Phase A (3A) c.2600-2450BC Early Urban period, Late Urban period, Mature Harappan, Integration Era Kulli Harappan, Sindhi Harappan, Sorath Harappan, Punjabi Harappan Eastern Harappan Quetta, Late Kot Diji 2500-1900BC Harappa Phase B (3B) c.2450-2200; Harappa Phase C (3C) c.2200-1900BC Late-Post Urban transition, Harappan-Late Harappan, Transition  1900-1800BC Harappa Period 4 Post-Urban period, Late Harappan, Localization Era Early Pirak (1800-1700BC), Late Sorath Harappan (1900-1600BC), Cemetary H (1900-1500BC), Swat Late Harappan in Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh (1900-1300BC), Jhukar (1900-1700BC). 1900-1300BC Harappa Period 5  A systematic study of rural ceramics offer the fresh opportunity to follow a bottom-up approach, and to explore questions of transformation, resilience and transmission beyond the urban sphere. There is much to be learned from the adoption of a comprehensive, integrated and systematic method for the study of rural ceramics that incorporates a range of quantitative and qualitative data. A combined approach is proposed as a feasible and replicable method for studying chaînes opératoires, technological choices and ceramic Figure 1.2. The present PhD project is part of the Work-package 3, ERC TwoRains project.   Table 1.1 Chronology of the Indus Civilisation (Kenoyer 1998; Possehl 2002).   7 traditions, i.e. a holistic strategy gives the opportunity to understand social dynamics within community dimensions and at a regional level. This requires the integrated use of various techniques, including technological and morphological study of vessels, scientific archaeometric analyses (i.e. thin-section ceramic petrography and geochemistry), data from multiple sites, an understanding of the palaeo-landscape, and comparative experimental and ethno-archaeological studies (see Chapter 4). Such a bottom-up approach will offer an empirically grounded opportunity to explore questions of about the transmission, transformation, and resilience of ceramic traditions. When accompanied by an interpretative shift away from cultural evolutionary paradigms towards nuanced theoretical frameworks, it will be possible to better define the nature of traditions in order to characterise communities of practice, social units, variability of social units and ceramic landscapes, which may have ‘overlapped’ rather than replaced each other in both a synchronic and diachronic perspective.  In order to answer the central research question of this project - Can a compositional and technological study of rural Indus Civilisation ceramic industries be used to explore communities’ identities and relations, and to trace evidence for continuity and changes in Bronze Age northwest Indian societies? – three sub-questions were developed:  What ceramic technological choices and traditions characterised the Indus rural context? This question aims to explore the variability of technological choices, chaînes opératoires and ceramic traditions at each study site. This will consider both synchronic and diachronic variability within each given assemblage.  Did ceramic industries develop or collapse during the Indus early Urban and late Urban periods? This question aims to explore the impact of major socio-political and environmental changes on rural systems of productions and ceramic industries, including the urbanisation and deurbanisation processes and significant climatic changes. The transformations and continuity of systems of production at each major transitional phase will be observed and discussed.  Were ceramic industries in the Urban period sustained by a centralised system of production, or by multi-layered self-sustained horizons of traditional practices? This question aims to understand how systems of productions were organised and expressed in the rural context, exploring the possible scenarios of controlled centralised industries, and the self-sustained   8 landscapes of rural traditional practices. Thus, this will explore how systems of production were organised and sustained within and among rural communities.   1.3 Structure of the thesis The thesis is organised in three main parts. Part one will describe the rationale, archaeological issues, methods and materials of the project. Following this introduction, Chapter 2 explores traditionally used theoretical frameworks often used in the study of Indus ceramic materials, such as culture historic interpretations, simplistic evolutionary approaches and demic diffusionism (also see Chapter 3.2). This will also propose to adopt a nuanced theoretical framework concerning making and learning to identify ceramic traditions by means of the chaînes opératoire approach, and to explore the variability in social complexity at the studied sites, as well as the related landscapes of craftpeople and traditions. Chapter 3 represents the backbone of this study, presenting the current knowledge of ceramic technologies and industries of the Indus Civilisation, as a result of the past century of archaeological investigation in South Asia. This will highlight the major issues in our understanding of ceramic craft and technologies, as well as certain simplistic interpretations of systems of production in the vast Indus zone. The study site will also be presented there. Chapter 4 will offer a detailed description of the adopted methods as well as the studied assemblages and samples. This will highlight the importance of a nuanced approach for the study of ceramic artefacts for better characterising raw material sources, recipes and manufacturing techniques.  The second part of this thesis will present data and results, and their interpretations. Chapter 5 will present observations sprung from ethnographic work with local communities of potters, especially concerning a better understanding of ceramic manufacturing techniques and raw material sourcing. This will emphases the importance of combining multiple methods to explore the palaeo-landscapes and the variability of clay sources, as well as presenting samples of clay-rich sediments used to characterised the chemical composition of possible sources. Chapters 6, 7 and 8 will present data and results gathered from the study of archaeological assemblages at three settlements, respectively Lohari Ragho (LHR) I and Masudpur (MSD) I in Haryana, and Alamgipur (ALM) in Uttar Pradesh, northwest India. The first part of each chapter will be dedicated to the macroscopic assessment of sherds and vessels. Fabrics, manufacturing techniques and surface treatments   9 will be broken down and assessed in order to identify the technical actions employed in the production of ceramics. In keeping with the chaîne opératoire approach, and by using a visual assessment of sherds, the narrative will follow observations on clay pastes and recipes, moving to the description of primary and secondary forming techniques, and eventually culminating with finishing techniques, surface treatments and decorations of vessels. Afterward, within each chapter the above-mentioned technical observations will be combined to reconstruct ceramic traditions. Techno-groups will be presented in a meaningful and comprehensive fashion, describing in detail their characteristics and cross-referencing the technical actions portrayed in the first part of each chapter. Each tradition will resemble an identity card, discussing its manufacturing techniques, decoration and morphologies, and including references to similar synchronic traditions in the region. Petrographic classes identified within each site’s assemblage will be presented and discussed, together with the chemical characterisation of ceramic vessels. Petrographic and geochemical analyses will be combined to: (a) reinforce the macroscopic technological observations; (b) better characterise paste preparations and recipes of vessels, resulting in a more detailed understanding of ceramic traditions; and (c) present results concerning possible local or non-local production of vessels.  Part three, i.e. Chapters 9 and 10, will present the discussion and conclusions. This will allow us to provide an answer to the central research question: How can a compositional and technological study of rural Indus Civilisation ceramic industries be used to explore communities’ identities and relations, and to trace evidence for continuity and changes in Bronze Age northwest Indian societies? The discussions will first revolve around each individual study site, presenting interpretations in a synchronic and a diachronic perspective. These will finally be combined, and will be integrated with interpretations concerning clay-rich sediments and sourcing. The resulting picture will define the nature of traditions and characterise communities of practice, variability of social units and ceramic landscapes at rural sites of South Asia’s Indus Civilisation.     10 Chapter 2. A theory of making and learning: traditions, transformations, and landscapes   2.1 Introduction Ceramic crafts - and artefacts in general - are physical manifestations resulting from the close relationship between makers, materials, and society. The study of ancient crafts has often been undertaken to build chronologies and typologies, characterise identities, and broadly define economic classification (‘specialisation’) of craft production (Brumfiel et al. 1987; Costin 2001). Little room has, however, been given to study the nature of skills and craft in ceramic production (Hosfield 2009) and the acquisition of knowledge by ancient potters, as an active medium of social change and relations.  In order to understand the development of craft traditions and to observe historical continuity or dis-continuity, it is critical to first explore the relationship between crafters and materials in terms of skills. Craft traditions are linked by common inherited technical gestures (Roux 2016), which are strictly bounded to social, cultural and sensorial perceptions of materials. Society, materials and makers, in this sense, are ‘partners in craft’, and they can be seen as equally important agents in the production process. The interaction between crafters and materials will be firstly explored, so as to move towards a broader picture and to use archaeological ceramic pottery as a tool to understand variability in functional and social complexit
