ABSTRACT
Urbanization plays a crucial role in the economic development of every country. The mutual relationship between the
urbanization of any country and its economic productive structure is far from being understood. We analyzed the historical
evolution of product exports for all countries using the World Trade Web (WTW) with respect to patterns of urbanization from
1995-2010. Using the evolving framework of economic complexity, we reveal that a country’s economic development in terms
of its production and export of goods, is interwoven with the urbanization process during the early stages of its economic
development and growth. Meanwhile in urbanized countries, the reciprocal relation between economic growth and urbanization
fades away with respect to its later stages, becoming negligible for countries highly dependent on the export of resources
where urbanization is not linked to any structural economic transformation.
Introduction
It is an established fact that urbanization in developed countries is accompanied by economic growth and industrialization
which mutually self-reinforce one another1. This historic pattern generates an expectation of a virtuous circle between economic
growth and urbanization regardless of local conditions2, 3. From classic urban economic theories4, 5 to the more recent scaling
approach to cities6, 7, the growth of urban population has routinely been used as a proxy for economic growth. This pattern has
also been observed in rapidly developing countries such as China and India but it cannot be considered a universal blueprint8
for deviations from this norm have not yet been fully explained.
In fact, as pointed out in several studies9–12, the increasing urbanization rate in persistently poor and non-industrialized
countries poses an important dilemma for urban economic theory. Why, given the same rate of urbanization, does Asia contain
a number of explosive economies while sub-Saharan Africa has seen very little growth? Moreover, in developed and advanced
industrialized economies, is there appears to be a competitive advantage in continuing this urbanization process indefinitely?
There are several theories aimed at explaining urbanization processes. Some argue that rural poverty moves people to
cities as was clearly the case in 19th century Europe and America13, driving the transformation from an agricultural to an
industrial-service based economy14, 15. Others argue that in the last decades there has been urban-biased public policy that has
led to over-urbanization12.
The most intriguing approach however is rooted in the mutual indirect effects of the World Trade Web (WTW) on global
urbanization16, 17. The dominant idea is that in open economies, domestic communities (such as cities) can trade easily with
other communities, boosting their exports in substituting industrialization for urbanization policy18. In simple terms, the
commodities can flow more freely using urban agglomerates as nodes in the trading networks between countries, generating the
ever present virtuous circle between economic growth and urbanization.
Starting from this theory, we analyze the WTW to explore the mutual relationship between the urbanization of the countries
and their economic production structure using the Economic Complexity (EC) framework. Economic Complexity,19–26 is a
new and expanding field in the economic analysis, which proposes "Fitness" and "Complexity" metrics to quantify the fitness
or competitiveness of countries and the complexity of products from a country’s basket of exports. The main focus of EC is
based on a bipartite representation of the World Trade Web where the nodes represent the set of world-countries and the set of
exported products defined as different entities. Countries and products are connected to one another by imposing a threshold
based on their Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)27 which defines the criterion for the existence of relations.
The Fitness and Complexity algorithm is a kind of PageRank method applied to WTW, where Fitness Fc is the quantity for
country c, and Complexity Qp is the quantity for products p. The idea at the basis of the algorithm is that the countries with the
highest fitness are those which are able to export the highest number of the most exclusive products i.e. those with the highest
complexity. On the other hand this complexity is non linearly related to the fitness of its exporters so that products exported by
low fitness countries have a low level of complexity and high complexity products are exported by high fitness countries only.
The Fitness metric is valuable in quantifying a country’s productive structure and structural transformations which enable

one to predict its future economic growth23. It correlates with the extent of economic equality28 and it has been used to analyze
the country’s growth path to industrialization29.
In this work, we couple the WTW data with the urbanization level of more than 146 countries worldwide, and analyze this
between 1995-2010 thus capturing the fingerprint of urbanization on countries’ productive systems through the lens of their
exports. We notice that in rural economies, the increase in urban population fosters structural changes in industrial exports. It
boosts the country’s diversification improving the country fitness, and allowing the export of more complex products. These
economic transformations fade away in countries that already have a high level of urban population (more than 60%) where
there is no relation between the urbanization process and the country’s fitness.
Within the sub-Saharan countries, we capture those where the virtuous circle between economic growth and urbanization
is fostering structural changes in those countries’ productive systems. On the other hand within countries with economies
based on raw materials, we assess the implementation of policy leading to urbanization that does not support any structural
transformations of their basket of exports.
Results
Economic Complexity and Urbanization
We represent the WTW as a bipartite network, i.e. by considering the set of world-countries and the set of products as different
entities and linking a given country to a given product if (and only if) the former exports to the latter above a certain threshold
(the so-called Revealed Comparative Advantage - RCA)27. RCA is a general criterion adopted in order to understand whether a
country can be considered, or not, a producer of a particular product. It quantifies how much the export of a given product p is
relevant for the economy of a country c in relation to the global export of p for all countries (See Methods Section below).
The country’s fitness and product’s complexity are the result of a non-linear iterative map applied to the WTW matrix
M19, 20, 30 (See Methods below).
Through the algorithm’s iterations, products exported by low fitness countries have a low level of complexity while high
complexity products are exported by high fitness countries only. The countries’ composition of their export basket depends on
their fitness. Fitness and Complexity are thus non-monetary indicators of the economy’s development: the fitness represents a
measure of tangible and intangible assets and capabilities, which drive the country’s development, such as political organization,
its history, geography, technology, services, and infrastructures21. Meanwhile complexity measures the necessary capabilities
which must be owned by a country in order that it can produce and then export the resulting product.
Within this framework, we include the dimension of a country’s degree of urbanization defined as the percentage of the
total population living in urban areas. Our aim is to quantify the link between a country’s urbanization process and their exports
as a proxy for their industrial economic system. To disentangle the relation between country productivity systems and their
urbanization, we have divided the set of countries in terms of their degree of urbanization, defined by the Urban Range, which
is expressed in four quantiles [Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4] (see urban range division in Fig.1B top).
More urbanized countries [Q3,Q4] in the early 2000s, export a wide range of complex products such as: textiles, heavy
manufacturing industries, and IT while rural countries [Q1,Q2] export products that require a low level of sophistication such
as raw materials and agricultural products (Fig.1A).
Highly urbanized countries maintain a similar distribution across the analysis years, with a long tail of low complexity
products and a consistent increase in the number of high complexity products. On the other hand starting from 2005, we
have noticed that rural countries change their export basket towards higher complexity products. This shift is shown by the
cumulative distribution functions of the different Urban ranges that decrease their distance from one another over time (see
Fig.1A inset) together with their median and peak distance.
We notice that countries within the higher quantile of the Urban Range, Fig.1B, are the ones with higher fitness and higher
diversification, whilst low urbanized countries have a low diversification and fitness. Notable exceptions are countries with
exports based on raw materials (i.e. Qatar, Kuwait, Gabon, Iraq, Libya). These countries reached higher levels of urbanization
as result of policy decisions31 meanwhile their exports are limited to a few products with low complexity.
The representation of the WTW in Fig. 1C shows country exports in 2010 rearranged by ranked fitness and complexity. The
country exports’ diversification is related to the urbanization level. Low urbanized countries are at the bottom of the matrix
with low fitness and lower degree of diversification, whilst the urbanized countries, with the most advanced economies lie at the
top, with a high degree of product diversification with different levels of complexity and high fitness.
Exports Diversification and Urbanization
It is known that low fitness countries have similar economies with low degrees of diversification and high similarity with respect
to their export baskets20, 32, 33 i. e. they produce and export few of the same low technology products. We captured a shift in the
distribution of the exported products within the rural countries (Fig.1A). In particular, we noticed that rural countries start to

produce and export more sophisticated products. This productive systems transformation in the EC literature is related to the
development of new capabilities22, 34, 35.
Some questions from this analysis emerge: do the rural countries evolve their productive systems in the same way? and do
they continue to produce and export the same products? Is the pattern of economic development entangled with urbanization in
same fashion for each rural country?
We can measure indirectly the transformation of the productive systems by analyzing the evolution of WTW topology. In

particular we can assess the changes of countries’ similarities in their exports studying the abundance evolution of network
motifs. A network motif is a particular pattern of interconnections occurring between the nodes of the network (i.e. between
the countries and their products). In our case we are interested in the abundance of the similarity motif µsim in Fig.2B (motifs
636, or X motif33): it quantifies the co-occurrence of any two countries as producers of the same couple of products as Eq.7
(and, viceversa, the co-occurrence of any two products in the basket of the same couple of countries). This represents the
simplest motifs36 that can quantify the similarities in the export countries’ diversification which maintains a pairwise correlation
within the products exported. Two economies with a fixed number of products exported are diversifying if the values of µsim is
decreasing while their production similarity increases with high values of µsim.

To provide a benchmark and asses the µsim statistical significance of the WTW we use the Bipartite Configuration Model
(BiCM)32 as a null model. This framework is valuable in the analysis of the abundance of the bipartite motifs36, enabling us to
detect financial crisis effects on a country’s export basket33 as well as export similarities between countries with same level of
economic development37.
We generated 1000 matrices using the BiCM32 (see Methods Section below) and we compare the observed abundances of
the similarity motif (Eq.7) in the real network with the corresponding expected values in the null ensemble using the Z-score.
The whole WTW manifests a progressive increase of the abundance of similarity motifs with respect to the null case33
(Black line Fig.2A). Highly urbanized countries show a similar trend of increasing similarity in their products exports. This
measure implies that rural economies are very similar with a higher abundance of the similarity motif with respect to the random
case having a high value Z-score. Interestingly, low urban range countries diversifying between each other manifest an opposite
trend. The exports diversification trends of the low urbanized countries coupled with the increasing complexity of the product
exported imply a nontrivial connection between urbanization and production capabilities. This measure outlines how rural
economies follow different development patterns based on their production systems. The urbanization phenomenon coupled
with the capabilities already presented in the country enable the production of different sophisticated products depending on
their environment.
Urbanization Growth and Country Fitness
The economic transformation of a rural country has an impact on its overall fitness value, and the competitiveness of its
productive system. In this respect, the urbanization process is key element in a country’s development and its economic
growth31, 38. To assess the relation between the country’s fitness and the urbanization process we analyzed the Urban Range
growth rate in relation to the growth rate of country fitness ranking between 1995 and 2010, as we show in Fig.3. The country
fitness ranking is the country’s ordered position with respect to the country’s fitness value in a given year. The growth rate of
the country’s fitness ranking is an easily understood tool to compare the transformations of a country’s productive systems with
4/10
respect to its competitors. It has been proven a reliable tool in quantifying the country’s relative degree of competitiveness
across different years providing a more stable measurement than the raw fitness value39.

Population Growth Rate. The error bar corresponds to the fit’s 95% confidence interval. The colors follow the Urban Range
Scheme.
For each of the four Urban Range quantiles we find a linear relation between the urbanization rate and the Fitness ranking
growth rate in Fig.3. Increasing urbanization within lowly urbanized countries is interwoven with increasing Fitness. Meanwhile,
the effects are minimal in highly urbanized countries (Urban Range Q3,Q4). We validate the urbanization/fitness relation
analyzing a 25% quantile sliding window on the whole urbanization distribution, which we show in black in Fig.3B.
We notice that in many rural economies, the urbanization process affects or has been affected by structural changes in its
economic production. (An example are countries such as Uganda, Nepal, Somalia.) On other hand, there are many countries
(such as IvoryCoast, Paraguay, Chad) where the urbanization process does not provide improvement in the fitness ranking40.
The self-reinforced mechanism between urbanization and fitness reaches a plateau within the urbanized countries (Q3,Q4),
where the urbanization does not affect or has not been affected by changes in fitness ranking. In this respect, the resource
exports countries manifest a shift toward a negative relation between urbanization and fitness. In fact in countries that are
heavily dependent on resource exports, urbanization appears to be concentrated in the cities where the economies consist
primarily of non-tradeable services41.
Urban Fitness Trends
The process of urbanization is often entangled with a country’s industrialization11. As countries develop, people move out
of rural areas and agricultural activities into urban centers, where they engage in manufacturing products42 which are more
sophisticated with higher complexity. This transformation is outlined by the increasing level of fitness of low urbanized
countries that are involved in the urbanization process. To leverage this information and capture its trends, we define the country
Urban Fitness Furbc (t) = Fc(t)∗Uc(t); this is the value of country fitness Fc weighted by the percentage of urban population Uc.
We cluster the countries Urban Fitness trends using the Louvain algorithm43 which is based on their correlation matrix

shown in Fig.4B. Three clusters emerge with high correlations disentangling the non-trivial geographical relations we show in
Figs.4A-C.
In Figure 4A countries with a clear urbanization trend (in orange) are ones with a stable increase in fitness ranking.
Meanwhile the blue cluster contains developed countries, where the urbanization does not provide any new input to the
economic development and resource dependent countries, where the urbanization is not only lead by deep structural economic
change. These results are in agreement with the Urban Range study in Fig. 3 that show a poor effect of the urbanization on
the country fitness, implying that over a given value of urbanization, other factors have a more important role in economic
development and growth. Finally, the third cluster (in red) are the countries without any clear trend and are thus uncategorized.
Discussion
It is well-known that urbanization provides several advantages to the economics of scale and division of labour, boosting
productivity and competition. It helps in accessing the labor force and inputting materials to the production process as well as
decreasing the geographical distance between firms, reducing transaction costs, and fostering competition44. These urbanization
advantages45 together with the appropriate bureaucratic environment31, investment in infrastructures46 and companies market
structure47, are some of intangible attributes, the capabilities, that a country needs to drive economic growth and innovation34.
We noticed that the country Fitness, the production and export of goods, is interwoven within the urbanization process during
the early stages of country’s economic development and growth. We show that the information carried by WTW can provide a
different perspective on analyzing the complex process of urbanization, enlightening the relation between a country’s exports,
economic development and its urban growth.

145 countries c ∈ [1,C] and the 1131 products p ∈ [1,P] between the years [1995,2010] throught the bipartite matrix M˜ with
dimension (C×P) where each entry m˜c,p measures the export in US dollars. The framework of the Economic-Complexity19–22

This indicates that the connection (country-product link) is established if and only if the relative RCA is relevant (over the

Fitness and Complexity
Fitness and Complexity are a metric for countries and products applied to bipartite binary matrix M of the WTW19–22, 24.
The basic idea of EC is to define a non-linear map through an iterative process which couples the Fitness of countries to the
Complexity of products. At every step of the iteration, the Fitness Fc of a given country c is proportional to the sum of the
exported products, weighted by their complexity parameter Qp. In particular, the Fitness Fc for the generic country c and
Quality Qp for the generic product p at the n−th step of iteration, are defined as:

where the symbols 〈·〉 indicate the average taken over the proper set. The initial condition are taken as F0c = Q0p = 1 ∀c ∈
Nc, ∀p ∈ Np, where Nc and Np are the number respectively of countries and products (the convergence of the algorithm
described by Eqs.(4) depends on the shape of the matrix M, as it has been discussed in39).
Bipartite Configuration Model (BICM)
The Bipartite Configuration Model (BICM), as defined by32, 33, is a null model of general applicability that is able to generate
a grandcanonical ensemble of bipartite, undirected, binary networks in which the two layers Country and Products have
respectively C and P nodes. The ensemble generate by the BICM constrained the number of connections for each node, on

The numerical values of the unknown parameters~x and~y have to be determined by solving the following system of C+P
equations, which constrains the ensemble average values of countries diversification and products ubiquities to match the real

Where {d∗c}Cc=1 and {u∗p}Sp=1 are the real degree sequence of countries, and industry sectors respectively, and 〈·〉 represents
the ensemble average of a given quantity, over the ensemble measure defined by Eq.6 - as 〈dc〉 = ∑s pcp and 〈us〉 = ∑c pcp.
Indicated with an asterisk, “∗" are the parameters that satisfy the systems.
Similarity Motifs
In the present work we have sampled the grand canonical ensemble of binary, undirected, bipartite networks induced by the
BiCM, according to the probability coefficients P(M|~x∗,~y∗) and calculated the average and variance of the motif µsim, define
as b-motif6 in36.
The Similarity Motif represents the symmetric and complete connections between two countries c,c′ and two industry
sectors p, p′. The number of similarity motifs is:
µsim =

C
∑
c=1
C
∑
c=1
Zcc′(Zcc′ −1)−

C
∑
c=1
dc(dc−1) (7)
withZ is the matrix of dimension (C,C), that represents the projection of M over the countries. Each entryZcc′ counts the
number of industry sectors in common between the countries c and c′, it is defined as: Zcc′ = ∑Ss=1McsMc′s =MMT
This motif represents the co-occurrence of two products in two countries’ export basket within the bipatite matrix of the
country exports. The accuracy of the BiCM prediction in reproducing the value of quantity µsim please follows32.
