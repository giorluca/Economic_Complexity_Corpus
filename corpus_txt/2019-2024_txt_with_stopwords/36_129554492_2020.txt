This application is known as economiccomplexity and it evaluates the hidden capabilities of production by exploiting the data on theinternational trade of goods. The outcomes of the economic complexity methodologies are aranking of the countries, according to their economic growth potential, and a ranking of theproducts, according to the capabilities required for their production and export (moresophisticated products require more capabilities).The idea lying beyond the economic complexity framework is replicable and it can be effectivelyused in other fields beyond economics. A first example is ecology, where the approach is used torank the species interacting in an ecosystem. A second example is eco-hydrology, where themethodologies of economic complexity have been used to rank countries according to their virtualwater consumption.Here, we propose to exploit the approach of economic complexity to define a ranking of countriesaccording to the sustainability of the water used in agriculture. For each country, we define theamount of blue water used for irrigation, categorized according to the sources of water withdrawal(i.e., groundwater or surface water discretized with different thresholds depending on therechargeability of the sources). To structure the data as a bipartite network of countries-sourcesallows one to rank countries according to the impact of their agriculture on the global waterresources, while ranking the sources of blue water for their sustainability. In this view, less valuedwater sources – in the sense of being more rechargeable – are found at the bottom of the ranking,while more valued water sources, as the fossil ones, are found at the top positions. Our resultsreveal the performance of countries in terms of their water management strategies. This approachcould pave the way to a new class of indicators of water security and management that could helppolicy makers in the definition of new strategies for granting water security on a global scale.Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)
