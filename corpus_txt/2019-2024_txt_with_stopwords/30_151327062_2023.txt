The article studies the relationship between economic complexity and income inequalityacross EU countries from 1995 to 2020. The analysed period characterises high globalisation in which“new” EU countries experienced a high transformation of their productive structure. Productionstructure largely determines income distribution and, thus, income inequality. We employed paneldata methodology to assess the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality. Tocontrol for economic activity and education, GDP per capita and average years of secondary schoolingare also included in the analysis. Expectedly, our findings point to the correlation between economiccomplexity and income inequality in EU countries. However, the results also indicate an opposite effectbetween the “old” EU member states and a group of “new” EU member states. This finding suggeststhat “new” EU members needed more economic complexity in the observed period to reduce incomeinequality.Keywords: income inequality, economic complexity, panel modelReceived: February 23, 2023; accepted: June 8, 2023; available online: July 10, 2023DOI: 10.17535/crorr.2023.00071. IntroductionEconomic growth and development are connected with the transformation of productive struc-ture in which the economy moves from simple-low-teach activities to more technologically ad-vanced production processes. In that manner, the economy creates more complex products.Such sophisticated economies, as Hartmann and Pinheiro ([16], pp.1) state: ”. . . tend to out-source products that are less desirable (e.g., in terms of wage and inequality effects), and insteadfocus on complex products requiring networks of skilled labour and more inclusive institutions”.Although economic complexity and growth preoccupy economists the most, economic com-plexity and income inequality nexus have been increasingly examined in the last ten years.Countries with an increase in economic complexity have also experienced declining incomeinequality, even when controlling for income and human capital measures. There are severalreasons why a country’s production structure can be associated with its income inequality [13]:1. The country’s product variety limits workers’ and unions’ occupational choices, learningopportunities, and bargaining power. Countries with more complex products have lower incomeinequality levels than those with simpler products.∗Corresponding author.http://www.hdoi.hr/crorr-journal ©2023 Croatian Operational Research Society78 Boris Cota, Nataša Erjavec and Saša Jakšić2. The complexity and diversity of the products the country exports are a good proxy forthe knowledge and know-how available in the economy, which are not covered by aggregatemeasures of human capital (like, for example, years of education).3. Non-diverse economies, like high-income countries mainly based on natural resources, aremore vulnerable to suffering from economic and political capture.Since the beginning of the 21st century, academics and international financial institutionshave raised public awareness of inequality and its threats to social and economic development.Indisputably, exacerbating inequality has devastating effects on well-being.The literature states a plethora of factors contributing to aggravating/mitigating inequality.One essential issue is the existence of a clear-cut positive or negative relationship. The relation-ship’s sign and its existence are not the only things disputed in the empirical literature. Thereare doubts regarding the appropriateness of aggregate measures like GDP as a proxy for eco-nomic development for explaining variations in income inequality. For that reason, Hidalgo andHausmann [18] defined the economic complexity index which captures the notion that an econ-omy that can produce more diverse products is more complex. While Hidalgo and Hausmann[18] found that the indicator is strongly correlated with economic performance, its relationshipwith income inequality is yet to be systematically investigated. Even though recent studiesshow a negative relationship between economic complexity and inequality, generally, that linkis not unique.This paper aims at analysing the correlation between income inequality and economic com-plexity in EU member states. We are interested if there exists a significant difference in theeffect of economic complexity on income inequality between “old” and “new” EU member statesthat joined the EU in three enlargement waves in the 21st century. Upon accession, trade of“new” EU member countries with “old” EU member states has increased. Previous research[11] found that trade with economically complex countries (like “old” EU member states) isnegatively correlated with income inequality.The European Commission aims at boosting Europe’s competitiveness through innovation,which implies the need for structural transformation accompanied by cross-sectoral policy sup-port. In this way, the toolbox of economic complexity becomes more significant in the EuropeanCommission’s programs. Pugliese and Tachella [29] show that the concept of economic com-plexity enables bringing new insight for shaping the EU industrial policy.Considering that income inequality has risen substantially in the EU [2], the issue of inequal-ity is of great importance in EU countries as it challenges their economic outlook. Therefore,the aim of this research is to assess the connection between economic complexity and incomeinequality in EU countries from 1995 to 2020. The empirical analysis uses panel data method-ology with income inequality as a dependent variable and economic complexity as a regressor,using income and schooling as control variables.The contribution of our paper to the existing literature is twofold. First, the results ofthe analysis point to the correlation between economic complexity and income inequality in EUcountries during high globalisation. Second, we show that there is an opposite effect of economiccomplexity on income inequality between “old” and “new” EU member states in the period inwhich the “new” EU countries experienced a high transformation of their production structure.Although there are papers that included EU countries [24], this is (to our knowledge) the firstpaper that explicitly models the potential differences in the inequality-complexity relationshipbetween “old” and “new” EU member states.The paper is structured as follows. After the introductory remarks, the second sectionpresents the related literature. Data and adopted methodology are described in the thirdsection, while section 4 discusses the obtained results. Finally, section 5 concludes, providingpolicy recommendations, limitations of our research, and prospects for future research in thisfield.Economic complexity and income inequality in EU countries 792. Related literatureThe link between productive structure, economic growth, and income inequality has long beena topic in the economic literature. It is well known that the productive structure is the mainfactor influencing income distribution.Economic development is an essential factor in changing production structure. Kuznets[22] finds no clear-cut positive or negative relationship between economic development andincome inequality. Instead, the inverted U-shaped “Kuznets curve” highlights that economicdevelopment initially increases inequality. Later, the relationship turns positive to negative,contributing to mitigating inequality. Nevertheless, the claim is not without disputes as Perotti[28], Galbraith [12], and Palma [27] obtained evidence only of the negative relationship, whileDeininger and Squire [8] claim that the two are not related at all.Kuznets and Murphy [23], and Chenery and Taylor [6] emphasized the role of economictransformation as a process leading to change from low to higher productivity. That is whycountries whose economic structure has changed in favour of sophisticated products are devel-oping at a greater pace in comparison with countries that specialize in simple products [10].The problem of measuring the production structure existed until Hidalgo and Hausmann[18] created the Economic complexity index (ECI), which gave economists the opportunity toinvestigate empirically the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality. Amore detailed overview of the theory behind economic complexity and its empirical applicationscan be found in [17] and [4].Hartmann et al. [15] used OLS and fixed effects panel regression to show that increasingeconomic complexity leads to lowering income inequality.Based on cross-country OLS regression, [24] show that an increase in complexity is connectedwith lower inequality. However, the authors obtain the opposite result when employing adynamic panel model. The explanation is that the degree of income inequality increases whenthe economy experiences structural changes toward more sophisticated products. However, thelong-term effects of increasing complexity are positively correlated with the level of inequality,so increasing economic complexity increases income inequality.[15] showed that from 1962-2000, income inequality was lower in countries that exportedmore complex products. Moreover, they state (pp. 85): ”. . . production structures are a high-resolution expression of a range of factors, from institutions to education, that co-evolve with acountry’s export mix and the inclusiveness of its economy”. They also show that the ECI canpredict and provide information on the income gap. Their findings are similar to [24].Although most research assumes a linear relationship between economic complexity andincome inequality, specific studies are based on a non-linear relationship, e.g., [3]. The authorsfind a non-linear relationship between economic complexity and the income gap. They showthat countries with low and high levels of ECI have low-income inequality in contrast to coun-tries with medium levels of ECI that experience higher income inequality. Nevertheless, allthe previously mentioned studies point out that ECI is a significant factor influencing incomeinequality.ECI growth can reduce income inequality by affecting employment and learning opportu-nities [1], [15]. In this way, a higher ECI also means a sophisticated production structure andoffers a greater selection of occupations and study opportunities for workers. That process leadsto more equality in society. Hartmann et al. [14] find that occupational structure is an essen-tial mechanism through which ECI affects income inequality. Thus, for example, a productionstructure whose basic output is the primary good usually refers to a vertical occupational struc-ture instead of a production structure that mainly produces sophisticated products. A complexproduction structure in which more workers participate in activities with higher productivityand increasing returns to scale reduces inequality [24].Fawaz and Rahnama-Moghadamm [11], using data from 1964-2013, show that trade with80 Boris Cota, Nataša Erjavec and Saša Jakšićeconomically complex countries is negatively correlated with income inequality.While growing economic complexity is associated with strong economic growth and cross-country convergence, its impact on across- and within-country inequality is less clear. Addi-tional research is needed, especially to establish the causal mechanism. [26] show that lessincome inequality comes with greater complexity of green technologies. They emphasise therole of the middle class, which creates demand for green innovations and enables economies ofscale in production.Although some papers [24] include EU countries, there are no papers that explicitly modelthe potential differences in the inequality-complexity relationship between “old” and “new” EUmember states. Consequently, this is the literature gap that this paper covers. Splitting downthe sample based on when the countries joined the EU (“new” and “old”), we analysed thedifferences between the groups and examined whether the level of economic complexity is agood determinant of inequality in each group.3. Data and methodologyOur sample includes data for EU countries from 1995 to 2020 (T = 26), the period of highglobalisation (until the COVID economic crisis) in which “new” EU countries passed througha high transformation of their production structure.To analyse the connection between economic complexity and income inequality, we estimateda panel model with income inequality as a dependent variable and economic complexity as aregressor, using income and schooling as control variables.The model specification isyit = X′it β + αi + εit, i = 1, . . . N, t = 1, . . . T. (1)where yit is a dependent variable, Xit is the matrix of regressors, αi is the (unobserved)country effect, and εit is the error (idiosyncratic) term with E(εit) = 0, and E(εitεjs) = σ2ε ifj = i and t = s and E(εitεjs) = 0 otherwise.The dependent variable in the paper is the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequal-ity. As regressors, the model includes a measure of the set of productive capabilities availablein a country given by the Economic complexity index (ECI), ln- transformed GDP per capita(lnGDPPC) and average years of secondary schooling (Secondary), which act primarily as con-trol variables for economic activity and human capital.Since we are also interested in whether there is a substantial difference in the effect ofeconomic complexity on income between the group of “old” and “new” EU members, themodel includes an interaction term (ECI · new), where new is a dummy variable representingthe group countries (“new” or “old”).Barro and Lee [5] provide the source for data on secondary years of schooling. As data onschooling are available only at 5-year intervals, we assigned the data at the beginning year ofevery period, i.e., data on years of secondary schooling in 1995 were used for the first period(1995–1999), data in 2000 were used for the period (2000–2004) etc.Table 1 describes the variables and data sources.Descriptive statistics for our panel data for all countries and two sub-samples “old” and“new” are presented in Table 2. The sub-sample “new” (the countries that joined the EU inthree enlargement waves in the 21st century) includes nine countries for which data on ECI areavailable, namely: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Poland,Slovenia and the Slovak Republic since ECI data are not available for Cyprus, Estonia, Latviaand Malta. The “old” EU member states, for which ECI data are available, include thir-teen countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, as data on ECI are not available for Luxembourg.Economic complexity and income inequality in EU countries 81Variables Description Data source PeriodGINIGINI index estimationbased on household disposable incomeStandardized World Income InequalitySolt, F.

Fisher-type tests are based on augmented Dickey-Fuller tests.Table 3: Panel Unit Root TestThe null hypothesis of non-stationarity was rejected for GINI and ECI variables (Table 3)but not for lnGDPPC and Secondary. Therefore, we conclude that GINI and ECI are I(0)processes. On the other hand, lnGPDPC and Secondary are I(1) and were hence transformedusing the first differences.4. Empirical resultsFor all EU countries for which data on ECI is available (22 countries as data for ECI for Malta,Republic of Cyprus, Luxembourg, Estonia and Latvia are not available), we estimated themodel (1) with the interaction term:GINIit = β1 · ECIit + β2 ·∆Secondaryit + β3 ·∆lnGDPPCit + β4 · new · ECIit + αi + εit,i = 1, . . . N, t = 1, . . . T.(2)Before estimating the model (2), we tested for the existence of individual effects, cross-sectional independence, groupwise heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation to determine whetherpanel models are superior to the ordinary OLS regression. The rejection of the null hypothesis(p − value = 0.000) in all tests for fixed and random effects confirms the appropriatenessof the panel model. The results of the Pesaran cross-section dependence (CD) test (CD =5.708, p − value = 0.000), the Wald test for groupwise heteroscedasticity (chi2(22) = 166.22,p−value = 0.000), and the Wooldridge test for autocorrelation (F = 711.253, p−value = 0.000)confirm the problem of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in our data.As the number of countries in each group was a significant factor in choosing the method-ology (small values of N compared to T ) we opted to estimate static models with correctedstandard errors which give the estimators with adequate statistical properties [30].Accordingly, FE and RE models employ robust standard errors that are robust to het-eroscedasticity and autocorrelation. Additionally, FEdriscoll models were estimated usingDriscoll and Kraay standard errors (Driscoll and Kraay, 1998) [9]. Driscoll and Kraay useda nonparametric technique for estimating standard errors. They applied a Newey-West typecorrection to the series of cross-sectional averages of the moment conditions. Adjusting thestandard error estimates ensures consistency of the covariance matrix estimator which is in-dependent of the cross-sectional dimension N . In addition to AR(1) autocorrelation, thisapproach accounts for the error structure that is assumed to be heteroscedastic, autocorrelatedup to some lag, and possibly correlated between the groups.

Monte Carlo study showed that Driscoll and Kraaystandard errors have significantly better small sample properties over alternative covarianceestimators when cross-sectional dependence is present [19]. Using Driscoll and Kraay standarderrors, and thus eliminating the negative effects of cross-sectional dependence, autocorrelationand heteroscedasticity, ensured obtaining more accurate estimator values in our models.To differentiate between the models, we used the robust Hausman specification test, whichperforms a (cluster-) robust version of Hausman’s specification test [20]. The obtained resultsare in Table 4.The results from Table 4 point to the significant correlation between economic complexityand inequality in EU countries. The estimated coefficient of the interaction term betweencomplexity and dummy variable representing a group is positive and statistically significant,suggesting a significant difference in sign and size of the effect between groups. For “old” EUcountries, economic complexity has a strong negative effect on income inequality, implying thatan increase in economic complexity in “old” countries is connected with lower income inequality.On the other hand, for “new” EU countries, the estimated coefficient of ECI is significantand positive, suggesting that greater economic complexity is connected with an increase inincome inequality. One simple and reasonable explanation for such a relationship is that inthese countries, despite the change in the production structure, a sufficient degree of economiccomplexity has yet to be reached to decrease income inequality.The coefficient for secondary education is negative and statistically significant in the REmodel, showing that schooling reduces income inequality.Splitting the sample and estimating the model (2) for two sub-samples of “old” and “new”countries gives the results presented in Table 5 and Table 6.The results confirm the negative correlation between economic complexity and inequality fora group of “old” countries and the positive for “new” countries. However, secondary education issignificant only in the “old” group with an expected negative sign, suggesting that the negativeeffect of secondary education (Table 5) is mainly driven by “old” EU countries.As a robustness check, instead of GINI, as a measure of income inequality, we used the in-come share held by the highest 10% income distribution, a variable TOP10 (data were obtainedfrom World Development Indicators). The results are almost the same (Table 7). ECI remainsa positive and significant predictor of income inequality. In this way, we confirmed the previousresult, according to which the achieved degree of economic complexity in “new” EU countriesstill needs to be improved to reduce income inequality.84 Boris Cota, Nataša Erjavec and Saša JakšićVariable FE RE FEdriscollECI -4.8544593* -4.7494173** -4.8544593***∆Secondary -0.3047553* -0.30291126* -0.30475529∆lnGDPPC -4.223583 -4.2031272 -4.223583constant 34.869546*** 34.723074*** 34.869546***Hausman (p-value) 0.30 (0.9602)F-statistic/ Wald F = 3.67 Wald chi2(3) =11.75 F = 18.40(p-value) 0.0439 0.0083 0.0001No. of observations 309 309 309Note: *p < 0.10; **p < 0.05; ***p < 0.01Table 5: Estimation results for “old” EU member countries (dependent variable GINI)Variable FE RE FEdriscollECI 3.4146407* 2.1519195* 3.4146407***∆Secondary 0.02987212 -0.07567353 0.02987213∆lnGDPPC 4.7375564 4.0841008 4.7375564constant 25.830229*** 26.900003*** 25.830229***Hausman (p-value) 0.35 (0.9502)F-statistic/ Wald F = 3.92 Wald chi2(3) =7.88 F = 97.02(p-value) 0.0544 0.0486 0.0000No. of observations 216 216 216Note: *p < 0.10; **p < 0.05; ***p < 0.01Table 6: Estimation results for “new” EU member countries (dependent variable GINI)Variable FE RE FEdriscollECI 5.4231542*** 4.7068314*** 5.4231542***∆Secondary 0.23295986 0.19267828 0.23295985∆lnGDPPC 4.1658264 3.7239252 4.1658264constant 28.94355*** 29.5517*** 28.94355***Hausman (p-value) 0.53 (0.9131)F-statistic/ Wald F = 16.27 Wald chi2(3) = 28.89 F = 28.55(p-value) 0.0009 0.0000 0.0001No. of observations 216 216 216Note: *p < 0.10; **p < 0.05; ***p < 0.01Table 7: Estimation results for TOP10 as a measure of income inequality for ‘new’ EUmember countries5. ConclusionBased on the panel data methodology, we find a correlation between economic complexity andincome inequality in EU countries from 1995-2020. The classification of EU countries into“old” and “new” shows that the two groups have different signs of the link between economiccomplexity and income inequality. While the economic complexity works to reduce incomeinequality in the “old” EU member states, we find the opposite in the “new” member states.One possible explanation could be that the “new” members, in the empirical period, did notEconomic complexity and income inequality in EU countries 85have a sufficient degree of economic complexity that led to the reduction of inequality. However,additional research is needed to be able to confirm it unequivocally. In our panel model, we useGDP per capita and the average years of secondary education as control variables for economicactivity and education. While education is statistically significant in the group of “old” membersand affects the reduction of inequality, it is not statistically significant in the case of “new”members. More research is required to study the moderating impact of countries’ educationallevels on the relationship between ECI and economic inequality. Furthermore, regarding thepositive relationship between economic complexity and economic inequality in post-transitioncountries, future research efforts should investigate whether there are differences among thepost-transition countries themselves.References[1] Acemoglu, D. and Dell, M.
