  Gaussian Distributions

 1 Economic Complexity Limits Accuracy of Price Probability Predictions by Gaussian Distributions Victor Olkhov Independent, Moscow, Russia victor.olkhov@gmail.com ORCID: 0000-0003-0944-5113 Abstract The accuracy of predictions of price and return probabilities substantially determines the reliability of asset pricing and portfolio theories. We develop successive approximations that link up predictions of the market-based probabilities of price and return for the whole stock market with predictions of price and return probabilities for stocks of a particular company and show that economic complexity limits the accuracy of any forecasts. The economic origin of the restrictions lies in the fact that the predictions of the m-th statistical moments of price and return require descriptions of the economic variables composed by sums of the m-th powers of economic or market transactions during an averaging time interval. The attempts to predict the n-th statistical moments of price and return of stocks that are under the action of a single risk result in estimates of the n-dimensional risk rating vectors for economic agents. In turn, the risk rating vectors play the role of coordinates for the description of the evolution of economic variables. The lack of a model description of the economic variables composed by sums of the 2-d and higher powers of market transactions causes that, in the coming years, the accuracy of the forecasts will be limited at best by the first two statistical moments of price and return, which determine Gaussian distributions. One can ignore existing barriers and limits but cannot overcome or resolve them. That significantly reduces the reliability and veracity of modern asset pricing and portfolio theories. Our results could be essential and fruitful for the largest investors and banks, economic and financial authorities, and market participants.

The first one describes the asset pricing and portfolio models under the assumption that predictions of price and return probabilities are given. The second one derives the forecasts of price and return probabilities, or only their average values and volatilities at horizon T, using various models, which are mostly not based on the first part. However, the market-based choice of the asset price probability and its prediction at horizon T hides essential difficulties of an economic nature, which significantly limit the accuracy of any price probability forecasts as well as the reliability of the asset pricing and portfolio theories. In the recent decades, the asset price theories have obtained many important results, and references (Markowitz, 1952; Sharpe, 1964; Fama, 1965; Merton, 1973; Fama, 1990; Cochrane, 2001; Fama and French, 2015; Campbell, 2018) present only a millesimal part of the current studies. Actually, the foundation of modern asset pricing theories remains rather peculiar and based on "highly restrictive and undoubtedly unrealistic assumptions.” (Sharpe, 1964), and Sharpe’s opinion that “…the proper test of a theory is not the realism of its assumptions but the acceptability of its implications…” 60 years later, it is generally accepted and still in use. The predictions of average price, return, and volatilities establish a separate, important field of research that is covered by as numerous studies as the asset pricing theories themselves. The price forecasting is considered within economic forecasting (Diebold, 1999; Snowberg, Wolfers, and Zitzewitz, 2012), time series analysis (Davis, 1941; Brockwell and Davis, 2002), Monte-Carlo simulations (McLeish, 2005), and, in the last decade, intensive studies of machine learning and AI methods for evaluating stock price predictions (Cao et al., 2021; Kelly and Xiu, 2023). We refer to these papers to indicate some forecasting methods only, but don’t consider here any reasonable review of that broad and important research. However, the current models of stock price and price probability forecasts, as well as asset pricing theories, may omit important factors and interrelations that determine the dependence of market-based price probability on market trade randomness. In turn, the predictions of market trade stochasticity should be based on general economic models that link market trade evolution with economic development. These rather complex problems cannot be resolved in one paper, but we make an attempt to figure out significant factors and relations that vitally impact the predictability of price and return probabilities. In our paper, we present a pure theoretical consideration of the market-based price and return probabilities in a general economic context and highlight the economic obstacles that  3 essentially limit the accuracy of forecasts of the probabilities at any horizon T. It is well known (Shephard, 1991; Shiryaev, 1999; Shreve, 2004) that the probability measure, characteristic function, and a set of statistical moments present almost equal descriptions of a random variable. In this paper, we consider a finite number of statistical moments as a tool for approximate predictions of price and return probabilities. We study the economic obstacles that vastly limit our ability to consider and predict many statistical moments and significantly restrict the accuracy of any forecasts of price and return probabilities. To forecast the statistical moments of price and return of stocks of a particular company, one should have estimates of similar forecasts of other stocks traded on the market. Obviously, predictions of economic variables are impossible without knowledge, forecasts, and estimates of their economic environment. To derive the forecasts of the economic environment, we consider consecutive approximations of the market-based statistical moments of price and return, which are determined by the statistical moments of market trade values and volumes. We start with a description of the market-based statistical moments of price and returns of stocks of individual companies. Further, we consider risk ratings, which take continuous numeric values. We show that the description of the m-th statistical moments of trade values and volumes for m=1,2,..n, depends on the assessments of the risk ratings of the traded companies. To describe the n-th statistical moments of trading stocks of a company, which is under the action of a single risk, one should estimate the risk ratings in the form of a n-dimensional vector x = (x1,...xn). Each component xm, m=1,2,..n of the risk vector x is estimated using economic variables of the m-th order, which are determined by the sums of the m-th powers of economic or financial transactions. We show that the usage of risk coordinates x=(x1,...xn) allows making a transition from the description of statistical moments of stocks of individual companies to the description of collective statistical moments of stocks of companies with risk ratings in the neighborhood of a vector x=(x1,...xn). That transition describes continuous economic media approximation and models the price and return statistical moments of stocks as functions of time t and risk vector x. Subsequent approximations describe the statistical moments of collective trade, price, and returns of all stocks traded at the market as functions of time t only. To derive these successive approximations, one should average market trade time series over sequential time intervals ε<< Δ ≤ Δx ≤ Δx. As ε we denote the constant period between market trades, which could be a second or even a fraction of a second. To assess the statistical moments of market trades, price, and return of stocks of a particular company during a  4 reasonable time interval Δ, one should average initial market transactions over Δ. To derive a continuous economic media approximation and describe price and return statistical moments as functions of time t and coordinates x, one should sum market trades with stocks of companies with risk coordinates in the neighborhood of vector x of the economic domain and average the time series over the interval Δx. To derive the statistical moments of price and return of the whole stock market, one should sum trades with stocks of all companies on the market and average the time series over Δm. We derive the equations, which describe the dynamics of additive economic variables as functions of (t,x) and the equations of collective variables of the whole market as functions of time t only. The slow evolution in time of the trade statistical moments of the whole stock market should serve as an economic environment for the description of the price statistical moments in the continuous economic media approximation as functions of (t,x). The solutions of the equations of the continuous economic media approximation at horizon T establish the ground for the estimates of the price and return statistical moments of stocks of a particular company. To do that, an investor should estimate the possible risk ratings xq=(xq1,…xqn) of a company q at horizon T. Then an investor could map the anticipated assessment of risk at the forecast of the collective trade statistical moments as functions of (t,x) and estimate the statistical moments of return of stocks of a company q at horizon T. That completely determines the statistical moments of price at the same horizon.  The origin of the economic obstacles, which limit the predictive capacity and accuracy of the price and return probabilities, lies in the fact that one can approximate only a finite number n of the market-based statistical moments. Each m-th statistical moment for m=1,2,..n of price or return is determined by the m-th statistical moments of the market trade values and volumes averaged over the time interval Δ, Δx or Δm. Each averaging interval contains only a finite number of market trades, and that limits the number of statistical moments that can be estimated. To increase the accuracy of the current price probability, one can enlarge the averaging time interval to assess more statistical moments. However, that ambition is vastly limited for two reasons. First, the increase in the time-averaging interval reduces the ability to make prompt investment decisions. The second, and much more significant economic barrier, is determined by the irremovable growth of the complexity of forecasting of each extra trade statistical moment. As we show in sections 3 and 5, each extra m-th statistical moment of price or return, which can increase the accuracy of predicted probabilities, creates one additional tough problem in the economic description. We show that the sums of the m-th powers of market trade values and volumes, as well as the sums of the m-th powers of any  5 economic or financial trades made during the averaging interval, determine the economic variables of the m-th order. For example, conventional economic investments during Δ are determined by the sums (without duplication) of the first power of investment transactions made by the agents during Δ. Similar to that, we call “m-th investments” the sums of the m-th powers of the investment transactions during Δ. We denote such economic variables as the variables of the m-th order. The mutual interactions of the economic variables of the m-th order establish economic problems almost similar to the complex description of conventional macroeconomic theories, which model relations between the variables of the first order. In turn, the assessments of the risk ratings of companies, must use the economic variables of the m-th order, which result in the derivation of components xm of the risk vector x=(x1,…xn).  The complexity of economic modeling of the m-th order and the strong rise of uncertainty driven by the estimates of each additional component xm of the risk vector x=(x1,…xn), greatly limit the number of statistical moments that could be predicted, which significantly diminish the accuracy of the price and return probabilities forecasts.  Actually, the stocks traded on modern markets are mostly subject to several risks. The estimates of ratings of several risks j=1,2,..J, which use the economic variables of the m-th order m=1,…n, produce the risk ratings of a company as matrix variables x=(xmj), m=1,..n; j=1,2,..J. Here, J determines the number of risks, and n determines the number of statistical moments of the price and return that are predicted by the model. Numerous risks, which impact stocks trading, additionally increase the complexity of economic modeling and reduce the accuracy of predictions of price and return probabilities. Eventually, our findings can be briefly stated as follows: The current markets provide a lot of trading data with a period ε, which allows to assess “today” many – 10, 20 or more - statistical moments of the market trade, price, and return during any reasonable averaging interval that can be equal hours or days. That helps “today” approximate the probabilities of the price and return with high accuracy. However, the predictions of the statistical moments at horizon T meet the irremovable barriers of economic complexity. The predictions of the 2-d statistical moments of price and return need forecasts of the 2-d statistical moments of market trade. In turn, that requires the economic theory of the 2-d order. The predictions of the 3-d, 4-th, etc., statistical moments require corresponding economic models of the 3-d and 4-th orders, which are even more complex. The assessments of the risk ratings determined by the economic variables of the 2-d, 3-d, or 4-th order increase the model complexity further. In the coming years, in the best scenario, the accuracy of the forecasts will be limited by the 2-d statistical moments, and hence the market-based price probability forecasts will be limited by  6 Gaussian distributions or their extensions (see App. A). The ignorance of the limits driven by the existing economic complexity may allow one to derive forecasts of the price and return statistical moments and probabilities, but with such high uncertainty that it makes predictions useless. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we consider the market-based statistical moments of price and return. In section 3, we discuss the vector nature of ratings for a single risk x=(x1,…xn). Further, we discuss the statistical moments of returns of stocks of companies with risk ratings in the neighborhood of a risk vector x and the statistical moments of stocks of all companies traded on the whole market. In section 4, we consider the statistical moments of stock price, determined by the statistical moments of returns. In section 5, we discuss the complexities that would face any investor in his attempts to forecast the price and return probabilities of stocks of a company using his own predictions and the collective economic environment of the market in the continuous economic media approximation. Section 6: Conclusion. In Appendix A, we present simple approximations of characteristic functions and probability measures by a finite number of statistical moments. In Appendix B, we introduce the main notions and equations that describe the dynamics of the collective economic variables in the continuous economic media approximation and in the approximation of the whole market. This paper is not for novices, and we believe that readers already know or can find on their own the definitions, terms, and models that are not given in the text. We assume that readers are familiar with conventional issues in economic theory, asset pricing and portfolio theories, risk assessment, the basics of probability theory, statistical moments, characteristic functions, partial differential equations, etc. We use the roman letters A, B, and d to denote scalars and bold B, P, to denote vectors and matrices. Reference (3.5) means equation 5 in section 3.  2. Market-based 
statistical moments of price and return We assume that market trades of stocks of a company are made at a time ti with a constant interval ε between trades: 𝜀 − 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡      ;     𝑡𝑖 = 𝑡0 + 𝑖𝜀     ;      𝑖 = 0,1, …   (2.1) The trade time series at ti introduces the initial market time axis division multiple of ε (2.1). As initial data, we consider the time series of trade values C(ti) and volumes U(ti) with stocks at times ti, which determine trade price p(ti) due to a trivial equation: 𝐶(𝑡𝑖) = 𝑝(𝑡𝑖)𝑈(𝑡𝑖)      ;       𝑖 = 0,1, …   (2.2)  7 Equation (2.2) defines the market trade price p(ti) of stocks of an individual company at ti. The initial time axis division ε can be equal to a second or even a fraction of a second. The time series of the trade value C(ti), volume U(ti) and price p(ti) are very irregular and of little help for predictions of the stock price at a time horizon T that can be equal to weeks, months, or years. One can consider market time series as random variables during any reasonable time interval Δ>>ε. For simplicity, we take Δ as a multiple of ε (2.3) with N terms of the time series ti inside Δ. To develop a pricing model at the horizon T>>ε one should average the initial random market time series over the interval Δ (2.3):  ∆= 𝑁𝜀   ;     𝑁 ≫ 1 ;       𝜀 ≪ ∆< 𝑇    (2.3) After averaging market time series over Δ (2.3), one obtains more smooth data that can be more useful for forecasting at the horizon T. Averaged time series introduce a transition from the initial market time axis division that is multiple of ε to a new one, a rougher time axis division multiple of Δ. Market trades with stocks of any company determine three initial time series of the financial variables that should be taken into account by any pricing model: the trade value C(ti), volume U(ti) and price p(ti) (2.2). It is impossible to independently define the probabilities of the trade value C(ti), volume U(ti) and price p(ti) that match equation (2.2). The given probabilities of the trade value C(ti) and volume U(ti) determine the probability of the price p(ti) (2.2). We consider the random time series of the trade values C(ti) and volumes U(ti) as the primary, which completely determine the stochasticity of the market price p(ti). To support this statement, we refer to Fox et al. (2017), which provides the perfect methodology for estimating national accounts on basis of the aggregation of additive economic variables as the ground for the definition of non-additive variables such as price, inflation, bank rates, etc. We follow Fox et al. (2017) and consider the additive random variables determined by the time series of trade values C(ti) and volumes U(ti) as the basis for describing stochastic properties of the stock price and return. Assume that the averaging interval Δ defines the time axis division tk, k=0,1,.. multiple of Δ: ∆𝑘= [𝑡𝑘 − ∆2 ; 𝑡𝑘 + ∆2]     ;    𝑡𝑘 = 𝑡0 + ∆ ∙ 𝑘   ;   𝑘 = 0, 1, 2, …   (2.4) For convenience, we renumber the initial trade time series ti (2.1; 2.3) and note them as tik, which belong to interval Δk (2.4):  𝑡𝑘 − ∆2 ≤ 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ≤ 𝑡𝑘 + ∆2    ;   𝑡𝑖+1,𝑘 − 𝑡𝑖𝑘 = 𝜀    ;    𝑡𝑖,𝑘+1 − 𝑡𝑖𝑘 = ∆      ;       𝑖 = 1, . . 𝑁   (2.5) Thus, we consider N terms of the time series tik in each interval Δk (2.4). That allows equally assessing the statistical moments of the market trade value C(tk;n) and volume U(tk;n) in each averaging interval Δk as (2.6):  8 𝐶(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛) ≡ 𝐸[𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)]~ 1𝑁 ∑ 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑁𝑖=1   ;    𝑈(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛) ≡ 𝐸[𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)]~ 1𝑁 ∑ 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑁𝑖=1   (2.6) Actually, the initial time series tik in each interval Δk (2.5) presents discrete data, as there is no data available between the trades with period ε. However, averaging the initial discrete time series during each interval Δk results in a continuous time model. One can use a moving average or other smoothing procedure to define (2.6) as a continuous time model. We use the notation tk in (2.6) to outline the particular time interval Δk (2.5), which results in definition (2.6). We use the symbol ~ to underline that relations (2.6) define only assessments of mathematical expectation E[..] by a finite number N of terms of the time series that belong to the interval Δk (2.5). The n-th power of equation (2.2) at time tik gives: 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘) = 𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘) 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)    ;     𝑛 = 1,2, …   (2.7) Equation (2.7) introduces the price n-th statistical moments (Olkhov, 2021a; 2022a; 2023a) in a way that has parallels to the definition of volume weighted average price (VWAP) (Berkowitz et al., 1983; Duffie and Dworczak, 2018): 𝑝(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛) ≡ 𝐸[𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)] =  1∑ 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑁𝑖=1  ∑ 𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑁𝑖=1     (2.8) Relations (2.6 - 2.8) give:  𝑝(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛) =  ∑ 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑁𝑖=1∑ 𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑁𝑖=1 = 𝐶(𝑡𝑘;𝑛)𝑈(𝑡𝑘;𝑛)     (2.9) 𝐶(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛) = 𝑝(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛) 𝑈(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)      (2.10) The first statistical moment of price p(tk;1) completely coincides with VWAP. It is well known that one can equally describe a random variable by its probability measure, characteristic function, or set of statistical moments (Shephard, 1991; Shiryaev, 1999; Shreve, 2004). Thus, the market-based statistical moments of price (2.8-2.10) completely describe the price as a random variable during Δk. A finite number N of the marker trades during any reasonable interval Δ results in that one can assess only a finite number of statistical moments of the trade value C(tk;n) and volume U(tk;n) (2.6). Hence, one can assess only a finite number of statistical moments of price (2.8-2.10). The finite number of price statistical moments p(tk;n) approximates the market-based price characteristic function and probability (Appendix A). The market-based price statistical moments (2.8-2.10) differ from the frequency-based price statistical moments π(tk;n): 𝜋(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)~ 1𝑁 ∑ 𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑁𝑖=1 = 1𝑁 ∑ 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑁𝑖=1       determined by probability P(p) ~ m(p)/N, which is proportional to the number m(p) of trades at a price p if the total number of trades equals N during the interval Δ. The economic nature of these distinctions between the conventional frequency-based and the market-based price  9 statistical moments is as follows: The market-based price statistical moments (2.8-2.10) take into account the impact of the size of the market’s trade values and volumes. With growth of n, the price n-th statistical moments (2.8-2.10) more and more take into account the contribution of the market trades with huge values and volumes. Contrary to that, the frequency-based statistical moments π(tk;n) describe the price statistics determined by frequencies of price only. The market-based price statistical moments p(tk;n) equal conventional frequency-based statistical moments  π(tk;n) only if all trade volumes U(tk) equal 1. Such an approximation is far from the reality of financial market trade. The market-based probability of stock price and return was described by Olkhov( 2021a; 2022a; 2023a; 2023b), and we refer there for further details. Predictions of price probability on the horizon tK =T ∆𝐾= [𝑡𝐾 − ∆2 ; 𝑡𝐾 + ∆2]     ;    𝑇 = 𝑡𝐾 = 𝑡0 + ∆ ∙ 𝐾  (2.11) require forecasting statistical moments of the trade values and volumes (2.6) at the same horizon tK =T. The more trade statistical moments that can be predicted, the higher the accuracy of the market-based probability of the stock price. To describe statistical moments of stock return when an investor sells stocks at time tik during Δk (2.4; 2.5), which he previously purchased at time tik-ξ one should consider the trade equation (2.2) during interval Δk (2.5) as follows: 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘) = 𝑝(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘) = 𝑝(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑝(𝑡𝑖𝑘 − 𝜉)  𝑝(𝑡𝑖𝑘 − 𝜉)𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘) = 𝑟(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉)𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉) We denote here return r(tik,ξ) as the ratio of price p(tik) at moment tik (2.5) to price p(tik-ξ) in the past at a time ti,k -ξ. For convenience, we take the time shift ξ as a multiple of ε: 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉) ≡ 𝑝(𝑡𝑖𝑘 − 𝜉)𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘)    ;       𝑟(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉) ≡ 𝑝(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑝(𝑡𝑖𝑘−𝜉)    ;      𝜉 =  𝜀 𝑗 (2.12) To simplify notations, we denote time shift ξ without index j (2.12). We denote S(tik,ξ) as the past value of the volume U(tik) of stocks at a time tik-ξ at a price p(tik-ξ). Using (2.2; 2.12), we present the return trade equation (2.13): 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘) = 𝑟(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉)𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉)    (2.13) Similar to (2.6), we introduce statistical moments of the past value S(tik,ξ) (2.12) determined by the volume U(tik) of stocks at the price p(tik-ξ): 𝑆(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑛) ≡ 𝐸[𝑆𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉)]~ 1𝑁 ∑ 𝑆𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉) =𝑁𝑖=1 1𝑁 ∑ 𝑝𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘 − 𝜉)𝑈𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘) =𝑁𝑖=1  (2.14) The n-th power of (2.13) gives 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖,𝑘) = 𝑟𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉)𝑆𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉)    (2.15)  10 Similar to (2.8-2.10), we define the n-th statistical moments of return r(tk,ξ;n) of stocks at the time tk with respect to the time shift ξ in the past at tk-ξ as: 𝑟(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑛) ≡ 𝐸[𝑟𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉)] =  1∑ 𝑆𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘,𝜉)𝑁𝑖=1  ∑ 𝑟𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉)𝑆𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉)𝑁𝑖=1   (2.16) 𝑟(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑛) =  ∑ 𝐶𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘)𝑁𝑖=1∑ 𝑆𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘 ,𝜉)𝑁𝑖=1 = 𝐶(𝑡𝑘;𝑛)𝑆(𝑡𝑘,𝜉;𝑛)    (2.17) 𝐶(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛) = 𝑟(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑛)𝑆(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑛)    (2.18) A finite number of statistical moments of return r(tk,ξ;n) determine the approximations of the return characteristic function and probability measure alike to approximations of the market-based price probability (Appendix A). For further details on the market-based probability of stock return, we refer to Olkhov (2023a; 2023b).  Relations (2.9; 2.10) on the price statistical moments p(tk;n) and relations (2.17; 2.18) on the statistical moments of stock return r(tk,ξ;n) establish mutual relations between them: 𝑝(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛)𝑈(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛) = 𝑟(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑛)𝑆(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑛)   (2.19) 𝑝(𝑡𝑘; 𝑛) = 𝑟(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑛) 𝑆(𝑡𝑘,𝜉;𝑛)𝑈(𝑡𝑘;𝑛)      (2.20) Relations (2.19; 2.20) prove that one can define the price statistical moments, characteristic function, and price probability measure using the statistical moments of stock return r(tk,ξ;n) and vice versa. To forecast the price probability, it is sufficient to predict the probability of return, and vice versa. These problems complement each other completely. One can forecast return statistical moments, and that is enough to predict price statistical moments.  However, the predictions of the market-based statistical moments of price and return of stock of a company are impossible without knowledge of the financial and market “environment”: the estimates of the price and return of other stocks traded on the market. To describe the statistical moments of numerous stocks traded at the NYSE or Nasdaq, one should distribute different stocks by certain parameters to distinguish them from each other. As a parameter that helps develop a distribution of different stocks, we select the risk ratings of their issuer companies. In the next section, we explain how assessments of the risk ratings of issuer companies traded on the market introduce the notion of risk coordinates in the economic domain and describe the market-based statistical moments of the stock return as functions of risk coordinates.  3. The market-based statistical moments of stock return as functions of risk In this section, we describe the statistical moments of stock return as functions of risk ratings, which we consider their coordinates in the economic domain (Olkhov, 2016a-2020). Up now, the major risk agencies, such as Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P, assess the risk ratings of the  11 majority of stocks, major banks, and corporations (Metz and Cantor, 2007; Chane-Kon et al., 2010; Kraemer and Vazza, 2012). Risk agencies use the letter notations AAA, AA, BB, and C to designate the risk rate. Each rating agency has its own letter grade system to protect and promote its business. However, more than 80 years ago, Durand (1941) proposed the use of numerical risk grades. Indeed, risk ratings are conditional terms that are used in economics and finance as helpful tools for sustainable management, investment, and economic modeling. Primarily, the risk notations should support the problems of economic modeling but not the promotion of a particular business. The use of numeric risk grades can support a unified methodology for risk assessments by different agencies and opens up wide opportunities for economic and financial modeling. We take the idea of numeric risk grades proposed by Durand (1941) and complement it by introducing continuous numeric risk grades. The notions of the most secure and the most risky grades are entirely contingent, and the symbol AAA can easily be replaced by a numeric value. We take the most secure risk grade to be equal to 0 and the most risky grade to be equal to 1. Thus, we replace the letter-based risk grade symbols AAA, BB, and CC by continuous numeric risk grades that fill the unit interval [0,1], which we call the economic domain. If one considers the economic system under the action of J risks, then the numeric values of agents’ risk grades fill the economic domain as a unit cube [0,1]J of RJ. The description of the economic agents by their risk coordinates in the economic domain gives great advantages for economic and financial modeling and reveals hidden economic factors and processes that impact economic evolution and forecasting. Continuous numeric risk grades distribute market stocks by their risk coordinates. That helps develop a description of the statistical moments of market trades, prices, and returns, taking into account the risk coordinates of the stocks of a company. For simplicity, at the first stage, we consider market trades under the action of a single risk. Even the description of the statistical moments under action of a single risk requires an essential modification of the risk rating notion. 3.1 Risk ratings as vector variables Here we reconsider and extend the notion of risk ratings in such a manner that it can match the description of a set of statistical moments as functions of risk. We don’t discuss here a particular methodology for the assessment of numeric risk ratings and consider it a worthy task for the risk rating agencies. However, the complexity of financial markets and the description of statistical moments of stock prices and returns as a tool for approximations of price and return probabilities require significant complication of the risk rating notion. We  12 consider the conventional assessments of risk ratings (Metz and Cantor, 2007; Chane-Kon et al., 2010; Kraemer and Vazza, 2012) to be a zero approximation. Actually, the substitution of the conventional letter designations of risk ratings by the proposed numeric continuous risk ratings is like opening the hidden Pandora’s box of economic complexity. Indeed, one can ask a simple question: should the numeric risk rating of an economic agent be a scalar or a vector? Such a question is almost impossible for literal notations and thus could be a surprise for researchers. Actually, the idea of describing the n-th statistical moments of the market trade value C(tk;n) and volume U(tk;n) (2.6), statistical moments of price p(tk;n) (2.8-2.10), and the return r(tk,ξ;n) (2.16-2.18) of stocks of a company as functions of the company’s risk rating x is very simple. The risk rating x can serve as the coordinates to describe the evolution of a company’s economic and financial variables and statistical moments in particular. However, to identify the m-th statistical moments of return r(tk,ξ;m) (2.16) for m=1,2,…n, one should assess the component xm using the economic variables of the m-th order. The risk rating of a company for the economic model that describes n statistical moments takes the form of a n-dimensional vector x=(x1,…xn). As an example, compare two statistical moments of the trade value of two companies a and b: Ca(tk;1), Ca(tk;2) and Cb(tk;1), Cb(tk;2). Assume that Ca(tk;1)=Cb(tk;1). Then it is reasonable to assume that the risk coordinate x1 of the company a, which identifies Ca(tk,x1;1) is almost equal to the risk coordinate y1 of the company b, which identifies Cb(tk,y1;1), and x1~y1. However, if the second statistical moments are very different and Ca(tk;2)>>Cb(tk;2), then to describe such a case, one needs additional variables x2 and y2 to take Ca(tk,x2;2)>>Cb(tk,y2;2). Thus, to describe a set of 
two statistical moments, one should use a vector x=(x1, x2). The description of n statistical moments requires a n-dimensional vector x=(x1,…xn).  The origin of the complexity of risk ratings for a company relates to the complication of the economic model, which takes into account a finite set m=1,..n of the statistical moments of the market trade values C(tk;n) and volumes U(tk;n) (2.6). Indeed, conventional economic models describe macroeconomic variables, which are composed of the sums of the first powers of trade values and volumes. For example, macroeconomic investments, credits, or consumption are determined by the sums (without doubling) of investment, credit, or consumption transactions made by all agents of the entire economy during an interval Δ. One can consider an investment made by an agent at time ti during an interval Δ as a market transaction, and the sum of investments made by all agents during an interval Δ defines macroeconomic investments as a macroeconomic variable. We underline that the sums are taken over the first powers of investment transactions. To a certain extent, conventional  13 economic models describe the relations and mutual dependence between the macroeconomic variables, composed by the sums of the first powers of market transactions. For convenience, we note them as the 1st order economic variables and call conventional macroeconomics the 1st order economic theory. Assessments of the risks of a company using economic variables of the 1st order, generate the x1 component of the risk rating vector x=(x1,…xn). However, the sums of squares of the market trades, and the squares of investment, credit, or consumption transactions made by agents introduce the macroeconomic variables of the 2-d order. For example, the sums of squares of the investments made by all agents during the interval Δ define the investments of the 2-d order. The sums of squares of credits during Δ define the credits of the 2-d order. We consider the description of the mutual dependence between macroeconomic variables of the 2-d order as the 2-d order economic theory (Olkhov, 2021b; 2021c; 2022b). The description of the 2-d order macroeconomic variables and the description of the 2-d statistical moments of the market trade value C(tk;2) and volume U(tk;2) (2.6), and the 2-d statistical moments of the price p(tk;2) and return r(tk,ξ;2) averaged during Δ establish the unified problem. Predictions of the 2-d statistical moments of the price p(tk;2) and return r(tk,ξ;2) depend on forecasting of the 2-d order variables. The use of the 2-d order economic variables to assess the risk ratings of a company generates ratings x2, which serve as coordinates of the 2-d statistical moments of price, return, trade values, etc. Consequently, the sums of n-th order market trade values, investment transactions, etc., during Δ determine variables of the n-th order. Risk assessments based on the economic variables of the n-th order generate risk ratings xn as the n-th component of the risk rating vector x=(x1,…xn). Risk assessments depend on the complexity of the economic model. The simplest case is presented by conventional economic models, which are based on the economic variables composed by the sums of the first powers of economic or financial transactions during Δ. Such models can assess the average market price and return as functions of x1. However, predictions of the market-based volatilities of price and return require forecasts of the 2-d statistical moments of the market trade value C(tk;2) and volume U(tk;2) (2.6) and the 2-d order economic theory. The predictions of the set of m-th statistical moments m=1,…n of price p(tk;m) (2.8-2.10) and return r(tk,ξ;m) (2.16-2.18) that approximate price and return probabilities require economic models of the m-th order for m=1,2,..n. The assessments of risks based on the economic variables of the m-th order generate xm components of the risk rating vector x=(x1,…xn). As we show below, predictions of the risk rating vector x=(x1,…xn) of a company on the horizon T determine the finite number of m=1,..n of statistical moments of return r(tk,ξ,xj;m) and define approximations of return and price probabilities.  14 3.2 Statistical moments of the return as functions of time and risk coordinates  In this section, we consider the statistical moments (2.6) of the market trade values C(tk,xqm;m) and volumes U(tk,xqm;m), the statistical moments S(tk,ξ,xqm;m) (2.14), the statistical moments of price p(tk,xqm;m) (2.8-2.10) and return r(tk,ξ,xqm;m) (2.16-2.18) of the stocks of a company q as functions of xqm component of the risk vector xq=(xq1,…xqn) for m=1,2,..n. We consider the transition from the description of the statistical moments of the stocks of a particular company as functions of its risk coordinates xq=(xq1,…xqn) to the description of the collective statistical moments of the stocks of all companies, which have risk coordinates in the neighborhood of the vector x=(x1,…xn). As the economic domain for the model, which describes m=1,2,..n statistical moments of the market trades, price, and return, we take (3.1):   𝒙 ∈  [0,1]𝑛  ;     𝒙 = (𝑥1, … 𝑥𝑛)        ;        0 ≤ 𝑥𝑚 ≤ 1  ;    𝑚 = 1, … 𝑛  (3.1) In 2022, the NYSE traded around 2500 stocks and the Nasdaq traded almost 3600 stocks of domestic and international companies (Statista, 2023). Let us study the stock market, which trades Q>>1 stocks of companies, and assume that the stocks are traded under the action of a single risk. A huge number Q>>1 of companies traded on the market causes that a lot of different companies q=1,..Q(x) can have coordinates xq in the neighborhood of the vector x of the economic domain. Choose a scale d<1, which defines a small volume dV(x) in the economic domain (3.1): 0 < 𝑑 < 1 ;   𝑑𝑉(𝒙)~𝑑𝑛 ;   𝒙𝑞 ∈  𝑑𝑉(𝒙) ↔ 𝑥𝑖 − 𝑑2  ≤ 𝑥𝑞𝑖 ≤ 𝑥𝑖 + 𝑑2  ;  𝒙 = (𝑥1 … 𝑥𝑛)  (3.2) The choice of the scale d allows at time tik sum the trade values and volumes of all the stocks of companies q, q=1,..Q(x) which have the risk coordinates xq (3.1) inside a volume dV(x) (3.2) near vector x of the economic domain.  Because each company traded on the market is described by the individual risk vector xq=(xq1,…xqn), we denote its trade values C(tik,xq) and volumes U(tik,xq) as functions of xq. However, we assume that the sums of the m-th powers of trade values Cm(tik,xq) and volumes Um(tik,xq) depend on the m-th components xm of the vector x=(x1,…xn). For m=1,2,..n we note the sums of the m-th powers of values Cm(tik,xq) and volumes Um(tik,xq) inside dV(x) (3.2) as: 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝑥𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝑥)    ;    𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝑥𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝑥)    (3.3) The value C(tik,xm;m) (3.3) at a time tik equals the sum of the m-th powers of trade values with the stocks of different companies q, which have coordinates xq inside a small volume dV(x) (3.2) near the vector x of the economic domain (3.1). The volume U(tik,xm;m) (3. 3) equals the corresponding sum of the m-th powers of all trade volumes at a time tik. Simple relations  15 (3.3) for m=1,2,..n transfer the description of the trade values Cm(tik,xq) and volumes Um(tik,xq) as functions of coordinates xq of the stocks of a company q to the description of the collective trade values C(tik,xm;m) and volumes U(tik,xm;m) as functions of coordinates x. We introduce a similar definition of the sums of the m-th powers of values Sm(tik,ξ,xq): 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝑆𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝑥𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝑥)     (3.4) The sums on the left side of (3.3; 3.4) are functions of xm components of coordinates x. The relations (3.3; 3.4) roughen the description of the market trade with the stocks of companies q=1,..Q and transfer it to the description of the collective trade values and volumes as functions of components xm of the vector x. We take the return equation (2.15) as: 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = 𝑟(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)   ;    𝑚 = 1,2, . . 𝑛   (3.5) Equation (3.5) at a time tik for the time shift ξ (2.12) introduces a new notion: the collective m-th return r(tik,ξ,xm;m) as a function of xm. The economic meaning of (3.5) is that it determines the collective return r(tik,ξ,xm;m) as a ratio of the sums of the m-th powers of values C(tik,xm;m) (3.3) of the stocks of all companies in the neighborhood of the vector x, which were sold at a time tik to the sum of the m-th powers of their values S(tik,ξ,xm;m) (3.4) in the past at time tik-ξ. Equation (3.5) transfers the description of the values and returns of the stocks of a company q with coordinates xq to the description of the collective market trade values C(tik,xm;m) (3.3), S(tik,ξ,xm;m) (3.4), and return r(tik,ξ,xm;m) (3.5), as functions of xm. That is the first step to replacing consideration of the financial properties of stocks of a particular company with a description of the collective market-based financial properties as a function of coordinates x. However, the return r(tik,ξ,xm;m) determined by (3.5), depends on the time tik (2.5) of a particular trade. The interval between trades equals ε (2.1; 2.3), which can be equal to a second or even a fraction of a second. Such frequencies of trades result in high irregularities in the trade values and cause irregularities or randomness of the return. To derive a regular and smooth description of return as a function of time and coordinates, one should average the return r(tik,ξ,xm;m) (3.5) over the averaging interval. The choice of the time averaging interval is not a simple problem. We have already described the time interval ε (2.1; 2.3), which is determined by the frequency of the market trades. We introduced the interval Δ (2.3-2.5), which determines the averaging of the trade values and volumes of the individual stocks of a particular company. We assume that Δ is the same for all Q stocks traded on the whole market. The trade values C(tik,xm;m) (3.3) and S(tik,ξ,xm;m) (3.4) for m=1,2,..n are determined by the sums of corresponding variables of the individual stocks in the neighborhood dV(x) (3.2) of x. We assume that the time averaging interval Δ≤Δx and take  16 that Δx is the same for all points x in the economic domain. The choice of the averaging interval Δx introduces a new time axis division with time series τk, which describe the collective trades averaged over Δx. For simplicity, we take Δx as a multiple of Δ and (2.3) ∆𝑥= 𝑘𝑥∆= 𝑘𝑥𝑁𝜀    ;   𝑘𝑥 = 1,2, . .  ;     ∆= 𝑁𝜀    (3.6) 𝜏𝑘 = 𝑡0 + 𝑘 ∆𝑥  ;     𝑘 = 1, . .    ;    𝜏𝑘 − ∆𝑥2 ≤ 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ≤ 𝜏𝑘 + ∆𝑥2      ;     𝑖 = 0,1, … 𝑘𝑥𝑁  (3.7) We mention that in (3.7), the time series tik represents the renumbered times ti (2.1) of the initial time series of market trades. Similar to (2.4; 2.5) we renumber the initial time series ti (2.1) so that each interval Δx (3.6; 3.7) contains kxN terms of the market trades (3.3-3.5) at tik. The choice of the interval Δx helps average the sums of the trade values C(tik,xm;m) (3.3). We determine the m-th statistical moments of the trade values C(τk,xm;m) at time τk averaged over Δx as (3.8; 3.9): 𝐶(𝜏𝑘 , 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) ≡ 𝐸[𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)]~ 1𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 =  1𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 (3.8) If one changes the order of sums in (3.8) then: 𝐶(𝜏𝑘 , 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)~ ∑ 1𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙) = ∑ 𝐶(𝜏𝑘 , 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)   ;   𝑚 = 1,2, . . 𝑛  (3.9) 𝐶(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚) =  1𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1      Above relations denote the m-th statistical moment of the trade values of the stocks of company q averaged over Δx. The variable xqm defines the m-th component of the vector xq=(x1,…xn). Thus, C(τk,xm;m) in (3.8; 3.9) for m=1,2,..n equals the sum of the m-th statistical moments of the trade values of stocks of all companies q with coordinates xq in the dV(x) (3.2) averaged over Δx (3.6; 3.7). We denote C(τk,xm;m) in (3.8; 3.9) as the m-th statistical moment of the trade value. The similar meaning has the m-th statistical moment of the trade volume U(τk,xm;m) in (3.10; 3.11):   𝑈(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) ≡ 𝐸[𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)]~ 1𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1   ;   𝑚 = 1,2, … 𝑛 (3.10) 𝑈(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)~ ∑ 1𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙) = ∑ 𝑈(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)  (3.11) Relations (3.8-3.11) define the m-th statistical moments of the market trade values C(τk,xm;m) and volumes U(τk,xm;m) as functions of time τk and components xm of the vector x=(x1,…xn). Similar considerations determine the m-th statistical moments S(τk,ξ,xm;m) of (3.4) at xm: 𝑆(𝜏𝑘 , 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) ≡ 𝐸[𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)]~ 1𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 =  1𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ ∑ 𝑆𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1    (3.12) 𝑆(𝜏𝑘 , 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)~ ∑ 1𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝑆𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙) = ∑ 𝑆(𝜏𝑘 , 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝑥)   (3.13)  17 We highlight that we use the symbol ~ to show that (3.8-3.13) are the assessments of the statistical moments by a finite number kxN of terms of time series. We consider the return equation (3.5) and determine the m-th statistical moments of return r(τk,ξ,xm;m) at τk (3.7): 𝑟(𝜏𝑘 , 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) ≡ 𝐸[𝑟𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; )] = ∑ 𝑟(𝑡𝑖𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 = ∑ 𝐶(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑞𝑚;𝑚)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)∑ 𝑆(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑞𝑚;𝑚)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)  (3.14) 𝐶(𝜏𝑘 , 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = 𝑟(𝜏𝑘 , 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)𝑆(𝜏𝑘 , 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)   ;    𝑚 = 1,2, . . 𝑛   (3.15) To justify our definitions of the statistical moments of the trade values C(τk,xm;m) (3.8-3.9), volumes U(τk,xm;m) of “sale” (3.10-3.11) and values of “purchase” S(τk,ξ,xm;m) (3.12; 3.13), which define the m-th statistical moments of return r(τk,ξ,xm;m) (3.14; 3.15), we refer to the famous work by Markowitz (1952). If one follows Markowitz, one can assume that an “investor” has a portfolio of q=1,..Q(x) stocks, which are determined by their coordinates xq. An “investor” purchased these stocks in the past at tik-ξ and “today” at tik sells them. The volume of the sale U(tik,xq) at tik is the same as the volume of the purchase at tik-ξ. Thus, the values of a single purchase S(tik,ξ,xq1) and the values of a single sale C(tik,xq1) determine the return r(tik,ξ,xq1) of stock q at tik at point xq as (3.16): 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝑥𝑞1) = 𝑟(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞1)𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞1)    (3.16) The total value of purchase SΣ(τk,ξ,xq1) at τk-ξ and the total value of sale CΣ(τk,xq1) at τk determine the total values of an “investor’s” portfolio q at τk-ξ and now at τk during interval Δx (3.6).  The ratio of the portfolio’s values define the return r(τk,ξ,xq1;1) of the portfolio q as:  𝐶𝛴(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑞1) = 𝑟(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞1; 1)𝑆𝛴(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞1; 1)   (3.17) 𝐶Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑞1; 1) = ∑ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1   ;    𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞1; 1) = ∑ 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1   (3.18) Due to Markowitz (1952), the return r(τk,ξ,x1;1) of the portfolio formed with q=1,..Q(x) stocks at x at a time τk should be weighed by the “purchase” values SΣ(τk,ξ,xq1): 𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞1; 1) = ∑ 𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞1; 1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙) = ∑ ∑ 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞1)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)  (3.19) 𝐶Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥1; 1) = ∑ 𝐶Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑞1; 1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙) = ∑ ∑ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝑥𝑞1)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)     (3.20) From (3.19; 3.20) obtain the return r(τk,ξ,x1;1) of the portfolio at x (3.21;3.22): 𝐶Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥1; 1) = 𝑟(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥1; 1)𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥1; 1)   (3.21) 𝑟(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥1; 1) = ∑ 𝑟(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑞1;1)𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝒙𝑞1;1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)∑ 𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑞1;1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙) = ∑ 𝐶Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑞1;1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)∑ 𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑞1;1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)   (3.22) From (3.22) and (3.9; 3.13) obtain the return r(τk,ξ,x1;1) of the portfolio through statistical moments of the “purchased” S(τk,ξ, x1;1) (3.12; 3.13) and “sold” C(τk, x1;1) (3.8; 3.9) values 𝑟(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥1; 1) = ∑ 𝐶Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑞1;1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)∑ 𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑞1;1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙) = ∑ 𝐶(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑞1;1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)∑ 𝑆(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑞1;1)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙) = 𝐶(𝜏𝑘,𝑥1;1)𝑆(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝑥1;1)  (3.23)  18 Our definition of the m-th statistical moments of the return r(τk,ξ,xm;m) (3.14; 3.15) at a point x for m=1 completely coincides with the definition of the portfolio return (3.21-3.23) by Markowitz (1952). For m=2,3,..n the market-based m-th statistical moments of the “purchased” 
values S(τk,ξ,xm;m) (3.12; 3.13) and “sold” values C(τk,xm;m) (3.8; 3.9), trade volumes U(τk,xm;m) (3.10; 3.11) and the m-th statistical moments of return r(τk,ξ,xm;m) (3.14; 3.15) give a direct extension of Markowitz’ approach for the m-th statistical moments of the portfolio return. 3.4 The statistical moments of the return of the whole stock market  To define the market-based statistical moments of return of the whole market, one should sum in (3.3) the stocks of all companies, traded on the market. We define the collective m-th trade values C(tik;m), the m-th volumes U(tik;m), and the m-th “purchased” values S(tik,ξ;m): 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞    ;    𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞   (3.24) 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝑆𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞    ;      𝑚 = 1,2, … 𝑛    (3.25) Relations in (3.24; 3.25) denote sums of trade values and volumes of stocks over all Q companies traded on the whole stock market. The collective m-th return r(tik,ξ;m) of all stocks on the market at time tik takes the form: 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘; 𝑚) = 𝑟(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚)𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚)    (3.26) To smooth variations of the return at a time tik, one should choose the market’s averaging interval Δm. The collective values and volumes (3.24; 3.25) of the stock market have a characteristic time of change longer than the interval Δx selected for the averaging of market trades and returns at the point x of the economic domain. For simplicity, we take the market averaging interval Δm as: ∆𝑥≤ ∆𝑚   ;    ∆𝑚= 𝑘𝑚∆𝑥=  𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥∆= 𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝜀    ;    𝑘𝑥, 𝑘𝑚 = 1,2, ..  (3.27) The market averaging interval Δm introduces a new time axis division multiple of Δm 𝜇𝑘 = 𝑡0 + 𝑘 ∆𝑚  ;     𝑘 = 1, . .    ;    𝜇𝑘 − ∆𝑚2 ≤ 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ≤ 𝜇𝑘 + ∆𝑚2      ;     𝑖 = 0,1, … 𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁   (3.28) Similar to (3.8-3.15) for m=1,2,…n obtain the m-th statistical moments of the trade values, volumes, and returns of the whole market as follows: 𝐶(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚) ≡ 𝐸[𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘; 𝑚)]~ 1𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘; 𝑚)𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 = 1𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1  (3.29) 𝐶(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚)~ ∑ 1𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1𝒙𝑞 = ∑ 𝐶(𝜇𝑘, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚)𝒙𝑞   (3.30) 𝑈(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚) ≡ 𝐸[𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘; 𝑚)]~ 1𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘; 𝑚)𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1     (3.31) 𝑈(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚)~ ∑ 1𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝒙𝑞)𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1𝒙𝑞 = ∑ 𝑈(𝜇𝑘, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚)𝒙𝑞   (3.32)  19 𝑆(𝜇𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚)~ 1𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉; 𝑚)𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 = 1𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ ∑ 𝑆𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1   (3.33) 𝑆(𝜇𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚) ≡ 𝐸[𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚)]~ ∑ 1𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁  ∑ 𝑆𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1𝒙𝑞 = ∑ 𝑆(𝜇𝑘, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚)𝒙𝑞   (3.34) From (3.29-3.34) obtain for the m-th statistical moments of return r(μk,ξ;m) of the whole market at a time μk averaged during the interval Δm (3.27; 3.28): 𝑟(𝜇𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚) ≡ 𝐸[𝑟(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚)] = ∑ 𝑟(𝑡𝑖𝑘,𝜉;𝑚)𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘,𝜉;𝑚)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘,𝜉;𝑚)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 = ∑ 𝐶(𝜇𝑘,𝑥𝑞𝑚;𝑚)𝒙𝑞∑ 𝑆(𝜇𝑘,𝑥𝑞𝑚;𝑚)𝒙𝑞   (3.35) 𝐶(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚) = 𝑟(𝜇𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚)𝑆(𝜇𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚)    (3.36) At the end of this section, we highlight the importance of the four consecutive time axis divisions determined by the four time intervals ε << Δ ≤ Δx ≤ Δm. The smallest interval ε is determined by the frequency of market trading. It introduces the initial market trade time series at ti (2.1) for the further averaging procedures. The scale Δ determines the time averaging interval for the assessments of statistical moments of market trade and return of stock of a particular company. For simplicity, we assume that Δ is the same for all stocks, traded at the market and that Δ is multiply of ε, so that Δ=N ε (2.3). The interval Δ introduces a new time axis division tk (2.4; 2.5) multiply of Δ. The sum of trades with stocks with risk coordinates xq in the neighborhood of point x of the economic domain transfers the description of the statistical moments of market trade and return of stocks of particular companies to the description of the statistical moments of collective market trade and return as functions of coordinates x. The collective trade value, volume, and return of stocks with risk coordinates xq in the neighborhood of point x change more slowly than the trade value, volume, and return of the individual stocks. Hence, the effective averaging of the time series of the collective trade value, volume, and return near point x can require a time interval Δx that is longer than the interval Δ of the individual stocks. For convenience, we take the time scale Δx as a multiple of Δ. We take Δx=kx Δ=kx Nε (3.6) and (3.7) Δx introduces a new time axis division τk (3.7) as multiple of Δx. The time series τk (3.7) describe the statistical moments of trade value, volume, and return averaged over Δx. Finally, the collective trade and return of the whole stock market determine the market interval Δm. The change in trade of the whole market is slower, than the change of collective trade of stocks near point x. Thus, the market interval Δm can be longer than Δx. We take market interval Δm, which determines time averaging of the collective trades of stocks of all companies on the whole market, as Δm=km Δx = km kx Δ=kmkxNε (3.27). The market interval Δm introduces the market time axis division μk (3.28), which determines the time series of the statistical moments of trade value, volume, and return of all stocks traded at the whole market. These four time series describe  20 the financial problems of the stock market with different accuracy. The different choices of time intervals result in different approximations of financial markets.  4. The statistical moments of stock price as functions of risks  Relations (2.19; 2.20) tie up the statistical moments of the price and return of stocks of a company q. The results of section 3 define the statistical moments of the collective price of stocks of companies with risk coordinates near point x and the statistical moments of the price of the whole market. From (2.19; 2.20) and (3.8-3.15), the m-th statistical moments p(τk,xm;m) of the collective price of stocks at x at a time τk averaged during Δx take the form: 𝑝(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = 𝑟(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) 𝑆(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)𝑈(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑚;𝑚) = 𝐶(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)𝑈(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)  (4.1) 𝐶(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = 𝑝(𝜏𝑘 , 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)𝑈(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚)   (4.2) From (3.29 – 3.36), the m-th statistical moments p(μk;m) of the collective price of all stocks traded at the market at the time μk averaged during Δm (3.27; 3.28) take the form: 𝑝(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚) = 𝑟(𝜇𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚) 𝑆(𝜇𝑘,𝜉;𝑚)𝑈(𝜇𝑘;𝑚) = 𝐶(𝜏𝑘;𝑚)𝑈(𝜏𝑘;𝑚)   (4.3) 𝐶(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚) = 𝑝(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚)𝑈(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚)    (4.4) The finite sets of n statistical moments of price p(τk,xm;m) (4.1; 4.2) and p(μk;m) (4.3; 4.4) for m=1,..n define the n-approximations of the price characteristic functions and probabilities (App.A). 5. Economic evolution and prediction of statistical moments of stock return  The continuous economic media approximation presents the transition from the description of the economic variables of individual agents to the description of the collective variables as functions of risk coordinates x (Olkhov, 2016a – 2021b). As the collective variables, one can consider the sums of the m-th powers of market trade values CΣ(tk,xqm;m), volumes UΣ(tk,xqm;m), and “purchased” values SΣ(tk,ξ,xqm;m) during the interval Δk (2.4). 𝐶Σ(𝑡𝑘, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖,𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝑁𝑖=1 = 𝑁 ∙ 𝐶(𝑡𝑘, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚)  (5.1)   𝑈Σ(𝑡𝑘, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖,𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝑁𝑖=1 = 𝑁 ∙ 𝑈(𝑡𝑘, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚)  (5.2) 𝑆Σ(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝑆𝑛(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝑁𝑖=1 = 𝑁 ∙ 𝑆(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚) (5.3) The sums CΣ(tk,xmq;m) (5.1), UΣ(tk,xmq;m) (5.2), and SΣ(tk,ξ,xmq;m) (5.3), for m=1,2,…n define the m-th statistical moments of price p(tk,xqm;m) (2.8-2.10) or (4.1; 4.2) and return r(tk,ξ,xqm;m) (2.16-2.18) in the same way:   𝑟(𝑡𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑞𝑚; 𝑚) =  𝐶Σ(𝑡𝑘,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)𝑆Σ(𝑡𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑞𝑚;𝑚)        ;      𝑝(𝑡𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = 𝐶Σ(𝑡𝑘,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)𝑈Σ(𝑡𝑘,𝑥𝑚;𝑚) (5.4)  21 We use relations that are similar to (5.1-5.3) to define the sums CΣ(τk,xm;m) (5.5) from (3.8), UΣ(τk,xm;m) (5.6) from (3.10), and SΣ(τk,ξ,xm;m) (5.6) from (3.12): 𝐶Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙; 𝑚)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 = ∑ ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1   (5.5) 𝑈Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = ∑ 𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙; 𝑚)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 = ∑ ∑ 𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1   (5.6) 𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) =  ∑ 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙; 𝑛)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 =   ∑ ∑ 𝑆𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞∈𝑑𝑉(𝒙)𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1   (5.7) 𝑟(𝜏𝑘, 𝜉, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = 𝐶Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)𝑆Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝜉,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)   ;    𝑝(𝜏𝑘, 𝑥𝑚; 𝑚) = 𝐶Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)𝑈Σ(𝜏𝑘,𝑥𝑚;𝑚)   (5.8) For the case of the whole stock market, the similar notations define the sums CΣ(μk;m) (5.9) from (3.30), UΣ(μk;m) (5.10) from (3.31), and SΣ(μk,ξ;m) (5.11) from (3.33): 𝐶Σ(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚) =  ∑ 𝐶(𝑡𝑖𝑘; 𝑚)𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 =  ∑ ∑ 𝐶𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1    (5.9) 𝑈Σ(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚) =  ∑ 𝑈(𝑡𝑖𝑘; 𝑚)𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 =  ∑ ∑ 𝑈𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1    (5.10) 𝑆Σ(𝜇𝑘 , 𝜉; 𝑚) =  ∑ 𝑆(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚)𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1 =  ∑ ∑ 𝑆𝑚(𝑡𝑖𝑘, 𝜉, 𝒙𝑞)𝒙𝑞𝑘𝑚𝑘𝑥𝑁𝑖=1   (5.11) 𝑟(𝜇𝑘, 𝜉; 𝑚) = 𝐶Σ(𝜇𝑘;𝑚)𝑆Σ(𝜇𝑘,𝜉;𝑚)    ;    𝑝(𝜇𝑘; 𝑚) = 𝐶Σ(𝜇𝑘;𝑚)𝑈Σ(𝜇𝑘;𝑚)    (5.12) The evolution of the collective additive variables such as the sums (5.1-5.3; 5.5-5.7; 5.9-5.11) can be described by the equations, which are somewhat similar to the equations of flows of fluids (App.B). However, we highlight that the nature of economic evolution has nothing in common with physical hydrodynamics, and we believe any direct comparisons make almost no sense. The dynamics of the ratios of additive economic variables describe the evolution of non-additive variables, like the m-th statistical moments of return and price. The change in agents’ risk ratings due to economic, financial, and other factors causes the motion of agents in the economic domain. Each agent carries its additive economic variables. The collective motion of agents in the economic domain generates the flows of agents’ additive economic and financial variables. The equations of motion (App.B) describe the dynamics of the collective additive economic variables and their flows as functions of time and risk coordinates (Olkhov, 2019; 2020). An investor, who is seeking to forecast the probability of price and return of a company q at horizon T should follow the path we described above, but in reverse order. On that path investors will face irresistible economic obstacles, which limit the accuracy of any forecasts of the market-based probabilities of price and return.  Any amount of economic, financial, or market data “today” can help assess only approximations of current probabilities of price and return. The accuracy of these approximations determines the possible errors in forecasts, and, hence, the probable financial  22 losses. Any assessments of the current probabilities of price and return of stocks of a company are determined by the choice of the time interval Δ, which averages the initial irregular market time series with a period ε between trades. The interval Δ>>ε determines the assessments of the statistical moments of the market trade value C(tk;n) and volume U(tk;n) (2.6). In turn, the assessments of the trade statistical moments determine the price p(tk;n) (2.8-2.10) and return r(tk,ξ;n) (2.16-2.18) statistical moments, which are linked by the relations (2.19; 2.20). The more statistical moments an investor can assess during the interval Δ, the greater the accuracy of the price and return probability he could get “today.” However, a long averaging interval Δ equal to days, weeks, or months could increase the number of statistical moments but would raise the uncertainty of current, “this hour” investor’s decisions. The choice of the duration of the averaging interval is an important problem that should be solved by each investor. It is well known that any predictions of economic variables for an individual company require forecasts of the economic and market environment. In section 3, we describe the statistical moments (3. 8; 3.10; 3.12; 3.30; 3.31; 3.33) of market trade and the sums of market trades (5.1-5.3; 5.5-5.7; 5.9-5.11) as functions of risk coordinates in the economic domain. The main advantage of our approach lies in the fact that we perform successive transitions from the description of the trade statistical moments of an individual company to the description of the statistical moments of the collective trades at point x and then to the description of the statistical moments of trades of all companies on the whole market. To predict the m-th statistical moments of price and return at the horizon T, an investor should forecast the sums of the m-th trade values CΣ(t;m), volumes UΣ(t;m), and values SΣ(t,ξ;m) on the whole market. Each extra m=2,3,..n requires the development of the additional economic model of the m-th order to describe the interactions between economic variables of the m-th order. In simple words, to increase the accuracy of the price or return probability forecast with an extra m-th statistical moment, one should develop additional m-th order economic theory, each comparable with the existing conventional macroeconomic theory. It is the first “impossible task” that an investor should consider on his way to estimating the economic environment that can help him forecast price and return probabilities. The forecasts of the whole stock market are useful but are too uncertain for predictions of the return and price probabilities of a particular company. An investor should refine the forecast and extend the description of market trade statistical moments from the model of the whole stock market to the continuous economic approximation of the market trades at point x. Using the slow  23 variations of the market trade sums (5.9-5.11) or the statistical moments (3.39-3.44) of the whole market as an economic environment, an investor should forecast the dynamics of the trade sums (5.5-5.7) or the trade statistical moments (3.18-3.21) as functions of x.  However, at that point, an investor faces additional hardships, including the problem of risk rating assessments. Each extra m-th trade statistical moment (3.39-3.44) generates a set of the economic variables of the m-th order. For each m=1,2,..n , the risk assessments using economic variables of the m-th order result in the definition of the m-th component xm of the risk rating vector x=(x1,…xn). To describe the dynamics of m-th trade statistical moments (3.18-3.23) as functions of x for m=1,2,...n, an investor should assess the risk ratings using m-th order economic variables as a source for evaluating each m-th component xm of the risk vector x=(x1,…xn). In the case of several risks j=1,2,..J, which can impact economic and market performance, the risk assessment becomes J-times more difficult, and risk ratings take the matrix form x=(xm,j), m=1,..n; j=1,.2,..J. The complexity and uncertainty related to the assessments of risk ratings significantly limit the capacity of investors to forecast a lot of the trade’s statistical moments. That limits the accuracy of the predictions of the market-based probabilities of stock price and return.  Now assume that an investor succeeds in accomplishing these two difficult models. An investor chooses the number n of the m-th trade statistical moments m=1,2,..n at a horizon T and evaluates the dynamics of the m-th statistical moments of the whole stock market (3.39-3.44). Further, at a horizon T for the single risk, an investor carries out the description of the trade statistical moments (3.18-3.23) as functions of the risk vector x=(x1,…xn) in the economic domain [0,1]n using the slow dynamics of the statistical moments of the whole market as an economic environment. Now, using forecasts of the m-th statistical moments (3.18-3.23) as functions of risk x at a horizon T, an investor can evaluate the return statistical moments r(T,ξ,xm;m) (3.24; 3.25) or (5.8).  An investor can consider the m-th statistical moments of return as functions of xm as good approximations of the corresponding m-th statistical moments of return of stocks of a company q with a risk component xqm near xm, such as |xm-xqm|<<1. It is reasonable, that the price statistical moments of stock
