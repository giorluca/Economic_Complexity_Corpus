In contrastto the commonly adopted approach that estimates the impact of economic complexity in a cross-country setting, we use panel data for Brazilian states to identify the relationship between economiccomplexity and income inequality at the sub-national level. Our findings show that the relationshipbetween economic complexity and income inequality has an inverted U-shape, indicating thatgrowing levels of complexity first worsen and then improve the income distribution in Brazilianstates. Our findings also show that this relationship is particularly prominent in those states that haverelatively high levels of urbanization and overall development. Furthermore, we identify separateeffects on income inequality from the degree to which regional productive structures are characterisedby diversity in terms of industries and occupations. These effects are particularly pronounced in lessdeveloped states with a more rural character. In combination, these findings confirm the importantrole that the productive structure plays in processes that drive improvements in income distributionsand suggest that more research on this impact is warranted at the regional level.Keywords: income inequality; productive structure; economic complexity; Brazil; regional1. IntroductionThe notion that the productive structure and the structural transformation of aneconomy play important roles in processes of economic growth and development canbe traced back to original contributions by economists including Rosenstein-Rodan [1],Prebisch [2] and Singer [3]. However, conceptual and data limitations have substantiallyconstrained empirical research in their attempts to accurately identify the associationbetween productive structure and economic growth. Predominantly, research has beencharacterised either by the use of broad indicators of structural transformation, such aschanging shares of manufacturing in economic activity [4,5], or aggregate indicators ofdegrees to which economic or industrial activity are diversified [6–8].With the introduction of the concept of economic complexity [9,10], this researchstrand has received an important impetus. Economic complexity, relating to the degreeof sophistication of a country’s productive structure, is affected by a multitude of factorsthat are related to economic growth, including factor endowments, geography, institutions,social capital and a country’s historical trajectory [11]. In line with this interpretation, itis likely that countries with a higher level of economic complexity are characterised byhigher growth and that increases in economic complexity exercise a positive effect oneconomic growth rates. This is confirmed by a large number of cross-country studies thatidentify positive effects of a country’s level of sophistication of export baskets or its degreeof economic complexity on economic growth [9,10,12,13].Sustainability 2021, 13, 1006. https://doi.org/10.3390/su13021006 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2021, 13, 1006 2 of 23More recently, research on the effects of economic complexity has been broadenedby examining whether a country’s productive structure also matters for the distributionof income. It is increasingly understood that, similarly to processes of economic growth,the income distribution in a country is affected by a number of underlying factors, manyof which are related to, or directly captured by, the concept of economic complexity.For instance, the degree of sophistication of a country’s product mix reflects the level ofknowledge that is embodied in the country’s population, as well as the availability of amplejob opportunities [11,14]. Furthermore, the quality and inclusiveness of institutions is likelyto co-evolve with the level of economic complexity of an economy. This suggests thatcountries with a high degree of economic complexity will be characterised by lower levelsof income inequality, as evidenced for instance by the cross-country studies by Hartmannet al. [15] and Lee and Vu [16].However, it may also be the case that economic complexity, especially in countriesthat are operating in earlier stages of economic development, is associated with higherincome inequality. Processes of structural transformation that involve moving from lowto higher value-added activities are often characterised by increasing levels of capitalintensity and the introduction of and increasing reliance on new technologies. This willfavour relative returns for high-skilled workers in an economy, resulting in an increasein income inequality [17]. Given that the relationship between economic complexity andincome distribution is difficult to predict a priori as it is open to multiple interpretations,more research is needed in order to improve our understanding of the exact nature of thisrelationship.In this paper we extend upon this emerging research strand by conducting a novelempirical analysis to obtain further evidence on the potential significance of the relationshipbetween economic complexity and the income distribution as well as on the nature of thisrelationship. The contribution of our paper is three-fold. First, instead of using a cross-country framework, we focus on the impact of economic complexity on income inequalitywithin an individual country. It is increasingly understood that drivers of economicgrowth, such as institutions and knowledge spillovers caused by the agglomeration of firms,workers and innovation, as well as inter-firm linkages between multinational corporationsand domestic firms, can differ substantially across regions within countries [18–21]. Thisnot only suggests that economic complexity is likely to be subject to substantial variationat the regional level within a country, but also that an analysis of the relationship betweeneconomic complexity and income inequality at the regional level will be particularlyinformative.Second, inspired by the original contribution of Kuznets [22] on the nature of therelationship between the income level of a country and the distribution of income, weexamine whether the relationship between economic complexity and income inequalityis characterised by non-linearity. Kuznets [22] proposed that the relationship betweenthe income of a country and its income inequality follows an inverted U-shape, whereby,following an initial phase where increasing income is accompanied with growing inequality,further increases in income generate a more equal income distribution. The relationshipbetween economic complexity and income inequality may have a similar shape. A countrywith a low level of economic complexity may experience an increase in income inequalitywhen the production of more sophisticated products disproportionally benefits high-skilled workers. At some level of economic complexity, other forces such as inclusiveinstitutions, rising job opportunities and stronger worker representation may then becomemore important, resulting in the effect of economic complexity on income inequalitybecoming negative.Third, we conduct our analysis on Brazil, a country that is characterised by high levelsof poverty and inequality. Brazil can be seen to be representative of a substantial numberof countries in the world economy who, whilst according to their average income can beclassified as lower-middle or upper-middle income countries, are still facing relativelyhigh levels of poverty and income inequality. Furthermore, these countries are oftenSustainability 2021, 13, 1006 3 of 23characterised by marked regional differences in terms of income and inequality, furthersupporting our focus on analysing the relationship between economic complexity andincome inequality at the regional level. In this way, our findings for Brazil may also berelevant for this wider group of countries that find themselves in a similar situation.The paper is constructed as follows. Section two surveys the small body of empiricalevidence on the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality. Sectionthree discusses income inequality in Brazil. Section four discusses the dataset and thespecification of the econometric model. In section five we present our main empiricalfindings, which show that the relationship between economic complexity and incomeinequality follows an inverted U-shape, indicating that growing levels of complexity firstworsen and then improve the income distribution in Brazilian states. This relationship isparticularly prominent in states with a relatively high level of urbanisation and overalldevelopment. We also find that industry and occupational diversity exercise additionaleffects on income inequality, further strengthening the notion that the regional productivestructure constitutes an important factor in processes impacting on the distribution ofincome in Brazilian states. Finally, section six summarises and concludes.2. Literature ReviewFollowing an initial focus on the impact of the productive structure of a country oneconomic growth, the introduction of the economic complexity index (ECI) by Hidalgo andHausman [9] has most recently fostered research on the effect of ECI on income inequal-ity [14–17,23]. Economic complexity can be seen as a “high-resolution expression” ([15],p. 85) of a number of underlying factors, including institutions, human capital, the avail-ability of job opportunities and worker representation. This suggests that countries witha higher level of economic complexity will be characterised by a lower level of incomeinequality, resulting from better institutions, more job opportunities, among other improve-ments. However, the findings of the small number of available studies are mixed, withsome studies finding a negative association and other studies reporting a positive effect.Hartmann et al. [15] were the first to estimate the impact of the ECI on incomedistribution. Using data for over 150 countries for the period 1963–2008, they test for alinear relationship and find that economic complexity is a negative predictor of incomeinequality. Their findings also show that, when controlling for economic complexity, therising part of the Kuznets curve-like relationship between GDP and income inequalitybecomes more pronounced. Furthermore, they examine the effect of the Product Gini Index(PGI), linking product categories to different levels of income inequality. Their findingsshow that products associated with the highest levels of income inequality (i.e., a high PGIscore) consist mainly of commodities (e.g., cocoa beans and animal hair), which have a lowlevel of economic complexity. In contrast, low PGI products include more sophisticatedforms of machinery and manufacturing products (e.g., textiles, machinery and road rollers),involving a high level of economic complexity. Using the same framework, Hartmannet al. [11] look at the structural constrains of income inequality in Latin America, bycomparing the productive sophistication and structural constraints on income inequalityof Latin American and Caribbean countries with that of China and other high-performingAsian economies. Their results show that Latin American and Caribbean countries continueto export products associated with high levels of inequality and low levels of economiccomplexity, and their productive structure strongly constrains their ability to generate anddistribute income. The intuition behind these findings is that complex products require alarger network of skilled workers, related industries, and inclusive institutions for economiccompetitiveness. Such characteristics are conducive to more equal societies. In contrast, thecompetitiveness of simple industrial products and resource-exploiting activities is mainlybased on resource richness, low labour costs, routinised activities and economies of scale,characteristics that foster more unequal economies.In contrast, other studies present evidence that indicates that economic complexityfosters income inequality. It is likely that economic complexity co-evolves with higherSustainability 2021, 13, 1006 4 of 23levels of value added, productivity, use of modern technologies, etc. In such cases, it maybe that rising levels of economic complexity generate larger wage differentials between lowand high-skilled workers, resulting in increased income inequality. An example of a studythat presents evidence of such a positive effect is Lee and Vu [16]. They estimate the effect ofthe productive structure using a system-GMM (Generalised Method of Moments) dynamicpanel with 113 countries with 5-year averages for the period 1965–2014 and find a positiverelationship between ECI and income inequality. Similarly, Chu and Hoang [17] carry outa system-GMM estimation covering 88 countries for the period 2002–2007 and find thateconomic complexity is associated with higher income inequality. Lee and Wang [23] alsoreport a positive impact of economic complexity on income inequality, based on the use ofa finite mixture model for 43 countries for the period 1991–2016.In extension of these findings, some studies provide evidence that suggests that therelationship between the ECI and income inequality may be characterised by non-linearity.Kuznets [22] argued that it is likely that the relationship between the level of income andincome inequality has an inverted U-shape. At early levels of economic development, thebeneficial effects from economic growth are likely to materialise amongst sub-groups ofa country’s population, generating increased income inequality. With ongoing increasesin economic development more and more people will start to participate in and benefitfrom the growing economy, resulting in a negative effect on income inequality. A similarprocess may apply to the effect of economic complexity on income distribution. Startingat low levels of economic complexity, increases in complexity may benefit capital ownersand high-skilled workers in particular, resulting in a worsening of income distribution.With ongoing increases in economic complexity, other components of economic complexity(e.g., institutions, worker representation, job opportunities) may become relatively moreimportant, which would change the effect of economic complexity on income inequalityfrom positive into negative at some stage.Hausmann et al. [10] present findings that suggest that such a non-linear relationshipmay be important. They look at opportunity value, or the rewards of knowledge accumula-tion, and how it relates to economic complexity. Their data reveal that countries with a lowECI have low rewards for knowledge; this is because countries with a low ECI are unableto effectively put knowledge to productive use. However, countries with high levels ofproductive knowledge also have low rewards for knowledge. In such countries, productiveknowledge already occupies a large fraction of the product space, limiting the returns fromfurther knowledge accumulation. Countries with an intermediate 
level of complexity varymuch more widely in their opportunity value. If we associate opportunity value with wagelevels, their findings imply that the relationship between the ECI and wage differentials ischaracterised by non-linearity. Le et al. [24] also provide evidence for this. They use datafor 90 countries for the period 2002–2014 to estimate the effect of export diversificationon income inequality and find evidence of an inverted U-shape relationship. Althougheconomic complexity is a more comprehensive indicator of a country’s productive structurethan the level of export diversification, their findings can be taken as support for the notionthat the effect of economic complexity on income inequality is non-linear.Summing up, the small body of evidence indicates that economic complexity playsan important role as driver of income inequality. However, the evidence is mixed, withdifferent studies reporting negative or positive effects, indicating that more research isurgently required. Considering the multitude of factors that are encapsulated by theconcept of economic complexity, the possibility that the relationship between economiccomplexity and the income distribution has a non-linear character is particularly interestingto examine further empirically. More precisely, whereas early increases in economiccomplexity can foster an increase in income inequality, ongoing increases in economiccomplexity may start to generate a negative impact on income inequality.Sustainability 2021, 13, 1006 5 of 233. Income Inequality in BrazilFigure 1 shows the evolution of the Gini coefficient for Brazil from 1976 to 2014.The Gini coefficient is a frequently used measure capturing the degree of inequality inincome between households. The value of the Gini coefficient ranges between 1 (perfectinequality where total income is concentrated in 1 household) and 0 (perfect equalitywhere all households have a similar share in total income). Despite some fluctuations inthe first half of this period, Brazil has experienced a steady decrease in inequality from1993 onwards, with the Gini coefficient decreasing from 0.604 in 1993 to 0.518 in 2014.Nevertheless, income inequality is still very high, and there are marked disparities in theGini coefficient across Brazilian states, thus attracting a lot of attention from researchers.Sustainability 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW  5  of  22  to examine further empirically. More precisely, whereas early increases in economic com‐plexity can foster an increase in income inequality, ongoing increases in economic com‐plexity may start to generate a negative impact on income inequality. 3. Income Inequality in Brazil Figure 1 sho s the evolution of the Gini coefficient for Brazil from 1976 to 2014. The Gini coefficient is a frequently used measure capturing the degree of inequality in income between households. The value of the Gini coefficient ranges between 1 (perfect inequality where  total  income  is  concentrated  in  1 household)  and  0  (perfect  equality where  all households have a similar share in total  income). Despite some fluctuations  in the first half of this period, Brazil has experienced a steady decrease in inequality from 1993 on‐wards, with the Gini coefficient decreasing from 0.604 in 1993 to 0.518 in 2014. Neverthe‐less, income inequality is still very high, and there are marked disparities in the Gini co‐efficient across Brazilian states, thus attracting a lot of attention from researchers.  Figure 1. Income inequality in Brazil, from 1976 to 2014, measured by the Gini coefficient. Au‐thors’ elaboration using data from the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA). Most of the studies on income inequality in Brazil distinguish between two main pe‐riods, 1981 to early 1990s and 1993 onwards [25]. A few authors focus solely on one of these periods (e.g., [26–28]), while others focus on both periods and explicitly try to dif‐ferentiate the determinants of inequality in each of the periods (e.g., [29]). While there is agreement that inequality in Brazil was not driven by the same factors throughout each of  the  two  time periods,  there  is no overall  consensus with  respect  to  the  relative  im‐portance of different driving forces. There are three broad groups of variables commonly distinguished as  important drivers of  inequality  in Brazil. The  first group  is  related  to education and socioeconomic aspects, the second one relates to macroeconomic aspects (in particular unemployment and inflation) and the third one concerns international trade. First, when focusing on the period from the 1990s onwards, a number of studies iden‐tify several factors that have contributed to the decline in income inequality, which are also linked to stark differences in income inequality between Brazilian states. In particular, education and average returns to schooling [26,29–31], government transfers and social assistance programmes [29,30], job formality [31], spatial and sectoral labour market inte‐gration [30] and changes in racial inequality [26,29,31] have been identified as significant predictors of income inequality in Brazil. Second, some authors argue that, next to education and other socioeconomic aspects, inflation and unemployment were more important in explaining inequality in Brazil, in particular during the 1980s [27,29]. Both inflation and unemployment can generate higher income inequality—the former by pushing middle‐income groups into poverty (inflation Figure 1. Income inequality in Brazil, from 1976 to 2014, measured by the Gini coefficient. Authors’elaboration using data from the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA).Most of the stu ies on inco e inequality in Brazil distinguish between two mainperiods, 1981 to early 1990s and 1993 onwards [25]. A few authors focus solely on oneof th se periods (e.g., [26–28]), while others focus on both periods and explicitly try todiff rentiate the determinants of inequality i f t i s (e.g., [29]). hile there isagre ment hat inequality in Brazil was not driven by the same factors throughout each ofthe two ime periods, there is no overall consensus with re pec to the rela ive importance ofdiffere t driving forces. There are three broad groups of v riables commonly distinguishedas important rivers of inequal ty in Brazil. The first group is related to education andsocioeconomic aspects, the second one relat s to macro conomic aspects (in particularunemployment and inflatio ) the third one concerns int rnational trade.First, hen the period from the 1990s onwards, a number of studi sidentify sever l factors hat have contributed to th decline i income inequality, w ichare also linked to stark diff re ces in income inequality between Brazilian states. Inparti ular, educ tion and average returns to schooling [26,29–31], gover m nt tran fersand social assistance programmes [29,30], job formality [31], spatial and sector l labourmarket integration [30] and changes in racial inequality [26,29,31] have been identified assignificant predictors of income inequality in Brazil.Second, some authors argue that, next to education and other socioeconomic aspects,inflation and unemployment were more important in explaining inequality in Brazil, inparticular during the 1980s [27,29]. Both inflation and unemployment can generate higherincome inequality—the former by pushing middle-income groups into poverty (inflationreduces the real income of all but more strongly affects the group in the middle), and thelatter by decreasing the incomes of those who are unemployed.The third group of variables relates to the impact of international trade on incomeinequality. Brazil went through a period of significant trade liberalisation between 1989and 1995, with tariff levels remaining relatively stable in subsequent periods, particularlySustainability 2021, 13, 1006 6 of 23from the early 2000s onwards. The effects of trade liberalisation have received significantattention in Brazil, because it impacted the country differently than it did other LatinAmerican countries. In countries such as Colombia and Mexico, trade liberalisation fostereda pronounced increase in inequality, counter to theoretical predictions [32]. In Brazil,however, trade liberalisation impacted wage inequality in the opposite direction [25,33].This was likely driven by a reduction in the wage premium of skilled workers and amovement of workers away from previously protected industries [25]. Nevertheless, someambiguity in the empirical evidence remains, with some papers finding no evidence ofany effect from trade liberalisation on the Brazilian wage distribution [34], and otherstudies presenting evidence of an initial positive and subsequently negative impact of tradeliberalisation on wage inequality [35].Finally, an important contribution is made by Castilho et al. [32], who look at tradeliberalisation and its impact on inequality and poverty across Brazilian states from 1987 to2005. They find that trade liberalisation significantly impacted inequality levels in Brazilianstates. However, the direction of the impact differed between rural and urban areas—whiletrade liberalisation led to an increase in both inequality and poverty in urban areas, itled to a decrease in inequality in rural areas. As a possible explanation for this, Castilhoet al. [32] point out that trade liberalisation in Brazil had a particularly pronounced impacton manufacturing sectors, which are typically set up in urban areas.Summarising, despite a process where the income distribution has been improvingover the last few decades, the issue of high income inequality remains an important featureof the Brazilian society. Furthermore, there are also important differences in levels of incomeinequality between Brazilian states. Various types of factors have been examined as possibledrivers of income inequality but there is no clear consensus on their relative importance,and a substantial part of the evolution of income inequality remains unexplained. Againstthis background, and in line with existing evidence on other countries, we hypothesisethat economic complexity may play an important role as a driver of income inequality inBrazil and that an empirical study on the relative importance of productive structures willgenerate important new insights into the process underlying the evolution of the incomedistribution in this country.4. Data and Regression ModelIn contrast to previous studies that have examined the relationship between economiccomplexity and income inequality in a cross-country framework, our empirical analysisis focused on estimating the impact of economic complexity on income inequality at theregional level within Brazil. Our motivation for doing so is that many factors that areincorporated into or closely linked with economic complexity are likely to be subject tosubstantial heterogeneity across regions within a country. For instance, there is growingevidence that industries are often spatially concentrated in agglomerations and that insti-tutions and their impacts are subject to regional heterogeneity [18,19]. This implies thatthe relationship between economic complexity and income inequality will have a regionaldimension, which is masked when using national level data.The regression model specification that we use in the present analysis is based pri-marily on Hartmann et al. [15] and Castilho et al. [32]. We follow Hartmann et al. [15] inlinking economic complexity to inequality. Castilho et al. [32] provide insight into the mainfactors that we need to consider as drivers of income inequality across Brazilian states. Thisleads to the following specification of the regression model:yit = αi + β1 ECIit + β2 ECI2it + β3 GDPcapit + β4 GDPcap2it+ γX‘it+ εit (1)This model expressed in Equation (1) posits inequality y in state i and period t asa function of economic complexity (ECI) and its squared term (ECI2), GDP per capita(GDPcap) and its squared term (GDPcap2), a number of additional control variables capturedin X, an idiosyncratic error term and state-specific effects αi. The dataset that we composedcontains 27 federative units (26 states and one federal district) with annual data for theSustainability 2021, 13, 1006 7 of 23years 2002–2014. The time scope of the dataset is determined by the availability of theinequality indices. Table 1 presents all the variables that we use in this study with theirdata sources.Table 1.

(**) Measured in 2010 Brazilian Reais.As a dependent variable, we use two alternative indices of income inequality in theform of the Gini coefficient and the Theil coefficient. The Gini coefficient is the most widelyused inequality measure, but has some shortcomings such as being sensitive to transfersat all income levels [36]. The Theil coefficient, on the other hand, can be more sensitiveto variations in the lower and higher tail of the income distribution, but is less intuitivethan the Gini coefficient. As such, it is common to consider both inequality measures forrobustness. ECI and GDP per capita are our main variables of interest. We include both ECIand ECI2 in the model to assess whether the relationship between economic complexityand inequality is characterised by non-linearity. We also include GDP per capita and itssquared term, to test for the presence of a Kuznets curve relationship.The ECI is calculated by taking the average complexity of the products that a regionexports with international comparative advantage, weighed by the share of overall exportsfor that location. Product complexity is based on the concepts of diversity (the number ofproducts that a region exports with comparative advantage) and ubiquity (the number ofregions that export a given product with comparative advantage). The underlying ideais that more complex products are produced and exported by a more limited numberof regions, requiring more productive knowledge. A region with a high ECI thereforeproduces a higher number of more complex products, which are produced by a limitednumber of regions (see [9,10]). The ECI data originates from the Secretariat of Foreign Trade(SECEX) and can be downloaded through DataViva, which is a large platform providingofficial social and economic data for Brazil at several regional levels. For each of the years,we z-transformed the ECI scores of the states and use the transformed variables in ourempirical analysis.Table 2 presents sample averages for the 27 federative units for the variables Gini, ECIand GDP per capita. São Paulo ranks first regarding economic complexity. Compared tothe other states, the productive structure is characterised by a markedly higher level ofcomplexity. Other states with a relatively high level of complexity include Rio de Janeiro,Amazonas, the Federal District and Acre. Among these states, the Federal District, SãoSustainability 2021, 13, 1006 8 of 23Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro also have the highest average levels of GDP per capita. TheFederal District, Acre, Alagoas, Piauí and Paraíba are the states with the most unequalincome distributions.Table 2.

The figure on panel (a) does not reveal any meaningful association, causedby the outlier state of the Federal District.

Scatterplots of GDP per capita and inequality; (a) all states; (b) excluding the Federal DistrictOther Control VariablesWe control for the level of human capital to test whether states with a higher levelof human capital are characterised by lower inequality. We use two different variables tocapture human capital. One indicator is the overall level of education of a state’s populationolder than 24 years. The other indicator captures the share of highly skilled and mediumskilled workers in a state’s labour force. We also include the size of the population acrossSustainability 2021, 13, 1006 11 of 23states, given findings presented by Hartmann et al. [15] that population size is associatedwith inequality.We include several variables following Castilho et al. [32]. One variable labelled“white” captures the percentage of a state’s workforce that declare themselves to be white;the expectation is that a higher percentage is associated with a lower degree of inequality.Another variable is the percentage of workers employed in the informal sector, which isexpected to be positively associated with income inequality. We also include the relativeimportance of the agriculture sector in a state’s economic structure, given findings that itexercises a positive effect on poverty levels (see [32]). Finally, we add a variable capturingthe degree of urbanisation across states to control for the difference in income inequalitybetween states that have a more urban or rural character.5.

Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05,* p < 0.10.The first set of estimated effects concerns findings from the regression model for thefull set of states with pooled OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and Gini or Theil as dependentvariable. The relationship between inequality and economic complexity has an invertedU-shape, with an estimated positive effect of ECI and an estimated negative effect of itssquare term. The estimated effect of GDP per capita and its square term reveal a U-shapedrelationship with inequality. The estimated effect of schooling is negative and significant,indicating that regions with higher levels of human capital are characterised by lowerlevels of inequality. The estimated effect of population is not statistically significant.Next, we re-estimate the model on a restricted sample that omits the state São Paulo,an outlier due to its high level of economic complexity. The nature and significance of theestimated effects of income per capita, schooling and regional population are the same aswith the full sample. The main difference is seen in the estimated effects of the ECI and itsSustainability 2021, 13, 1006 12 of 23square term. The nature of the estimated effects of these two variables remains the same,with a positive effect of ECI and a negative effect of the square term. The significance ofthe estimated effect of these two variables is lower, however, especially when using theGini coefficient as dependent variable.The main drawback of the pooled OLS estimations is that state effects are assumedto be part of the error term. The variables ECI and GDPcap vary over time to only a verylimited degree, as shown in Figures A1 and A2 in Appendix A. This prevents us fromestimating the regression model with a standard fixed effects estimation. With such anestimation, the variation across the states is wiped out and the limited variation of thevariables over the years does not allow for an identification of the effect of these twovariables. In order to capture the effects of time invariant characteristics in the estimations,we resort to estimating the regression model with a random effects specification, wherebywe also cluster the standard errors at the state level.The findings from the random effects estimations are largely similar to the results thatwe obtain with the pooled OLS estimations, especially when looking at the estimations withthe full set of states. The main difference concerns the results from the estimations with therestricted sample. When São Paulo is omitted from the sample, the nature of the estimatedeffect of ECI and its squared term is similar to previous results but the significance of theeffect of the two variables is affected.5.2. Extended ModelThe main findings from estimating the extended regression model are presented inTable 4. Looking at the full set of results, the inclusion of the additional control variablesdoes not impact on the nature and significance of the estimated effects of economic complex-ity and GDP per capita. Replacing schooling with the indicators of the regional variationof skilled and semi-skilled workers produces results that indicate that inequality is lowerin states with a relatively large presence of these types of workers. The other variablethat carries a significant coefficient in several estimations is the share of informal workersin the regional workforce. States with a relatively high presence of informal workers arecharacterised by a higher level of inequality.Turning to the estimated effects of economic complexity, a similar picture emergesas with the estimations of the baseline model. Overall, the findings indicate that therelationship between inequality and economic complexity follows an inverted U-shape.Again, the main difference between the pooled OLS and the random effects estimationis that the estimated significance of this relationship weakens when we control for time-invariant characteristics. However, the importance of examining the non-linear nature ofthe relationship is further indicated by the findings in the last two columns that containthe results when we omit the squared term of ECI from the model. When the model onlyincludes ECI, the results suggest that economic complexity generates a significant positiveeffect on inequality. The findings from the various specifications of the model indicate thatit is likely that the effect of economic complexity turns negative at some stage, suggestingthat ongoing increases and improvements of the productive structure of states will generateimprovements in the distribution of income. This important aspect of the relationshipbetween economic complexity and inequality is missed when the model only captures theeffect of the level of ECI.Sustainability 2021, 13, 1006 13 of 23Table 4.

Rural–Urban and Level of DevelopmentIn order to get a better understanding of the conditions under which the relationshipbetween economic complexity and inequality is most prominent, we examine the impactof the levels of urbanisation and overall development of Brazilian states. To do so, weestimate the regression model on sub-samples of states, whereby we separate the statesaccording to whether their levels or urbanisation and GDP per capita are below or abovethe sample median values. In the extended model underlying Table 4, we control for theeffects of the level of urbanisation and the share of agriculture in the regional economieson inequality. By estimating the model separately for urban and rural states, we allow forthe coefficients of all the variables to differ between these two types of state. The reasoningfor separating states according to their level of GDP per capita is similar. The findings fromestimating the model on the sub-samples of states are shown in Tables 5 and 6.Sustainability 2021, 13, 1006 14 of 23Table 5.

Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.10.The separate results for states with a more rural or urban character show clear differ-ences. The main variable lowering inequality in rural states is the level of human capital,as captured by education. It is the urban states where the non-linear relationship betweeneconomic complexity and inequality materialises. Similar to rural states, the estimatedSustainability 2021, 13, 1006 15 of 23effect of human capital on inequality is significant and negative in the urban states, whichare states where the GDP per capita variables also carry significant coefficients.The findings that we obtain from estimating the regression model separately for stateswith a relatively low or high level of development are very similar. The effects of economiccomplexity are prominent in states with a relatively high level of GDP per capita, as arethe effects of GDP per capita. In states with a relatively low level of income, there is someevidence that economic complexity does lower inequality, as evidenced by the estimatedsignificant negative effect of the squared ECI variable in the pooled OLS estimations. Theestimated effect of schooling on inequality is significant and negative in both low- andhigh-income states.5.4. Industry and Occupation DiversitySo far, the findings clearly confirm that economic complexity is an important driver ofinequality in Brazilian states. However, it may be that the ECI captures only part of theeffect of the productive structure of the regions. The ECI is measured with internationalexport data, taking into account international comparative advantages. This means thatindustries that produce for the domestic market are not captured by economic complexity.While for national-level data this seems like a reasonable assumption, when using data fora set of regions within a country this may be less so.One reason why the complexity of the productive structure may not be fully capturedby the ECI when using regional data is that a region may be involved in the production ofcomplex products for the domestic market, whilst producing less complex products forinternational markets. Second, it is well known that economic activity tends to spatiallyconcentrate within countries to benefit from agglomeration economies [37,38]. This isalso the case in Brazil, where exporting activities are concentrated in a limited number ofregions [32]. Other states may incorporate complex intermediate products that they supplyto the exporting states. As the ECI is based on international export data, it will assigncomplexity only to the states that export products, without taking into account that part ofthe complexity of these states is linked to complexity of economic activity in other statesthat provide the intermediate products.In an attempt to widen the measurement of the productive structure of the economicactivities of the Brazilian states, we use two additional variables. One variable, labelledCNAE diversity (as it follows the Brazilian National Classification of Economic Activities),captures the level of industry diversity of a state, measured by the number of industries inthe states. The second variable, labelled CBO diversity (named in line with the BrazilianOccupational Classification), is measured as the number of occupations in a state. Inorder to facilitate their incorporation into the regression model, we z-transform both thesevariables.To obtain an impression of the nature of the relationship between the diversity vari-ables and income inequality, we create scatterplots between state averaged Gini and CNAEDiversity and CBO Diversity, as shown in Figure 4. Both scatterplots show a negativeassociation between industry diversity and state level inequality, suggesting that thisdimension of the regional productive structure may also generate an impact on inequality.Sustainability 2021, 13, 1006 16 of 23Sustainability 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW  16  of  22   (a)  (b) Figure 4. Scatterplots of economic diversity measures and inequality: (a) industry diversity (CNAE); (b) occupation diversity (CBO) Table 7. Economic complexity, industry and occupation diversity: pooled OLS estimations. Estimator  POLS  POLS  POLS  POLS Sample  Full  No SP  Full  No SP Dep. var.  GINI  GINI  THEIL  THEIL ECI 0.04 *** (0.007) −0.006 (0.01) 0.10 *** (0.02) 0.01 (0.03) ECI2 −0.008 *** (0.002) −0.07 *** (0.02) −0.03 *** (0.004) −0.16 *** (0.05) GDPcap  −0.22 ***  −0.20 ***  −0.71 ***  −0.65 *** Figure 4.

In contrast to thescatterplot in Figure 4, the estimated effect of industry diversity is positive, suggesting thatregions with a high presence of different industries are characterised by a higher level ofSustainability 2021, 13, 1006 17 of 23inequality. In contrast, the estimated effect of occupation diversity indicates that regionswith a high number of occupations have a lower level of inequality. Importantly, theinclusion of the two diversity variables does not affect the estimated effects of the economiccomplexity variables, which are the same as in the previous tables. This indicates that, inaddition to economic complexity, the diversity of economic activity across states is also animportant driver of income inequality in Brazilian states.Table 7.

Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.10.To further examine the conditions under which diversity impacts inequality, we alsoestimate the regression model on subsamples of states, separating states according to theirlevel of urbanisation and their overall level of development. The last four columns inTable 8 present the results for the subsamples. The findings show a structural differencebetween the effects of diversity and economic complexity on inequality. The two diversityvariables are significantly associated with inequality in states with a below median level ofurbanisation or level of development. Their estimated effect is statistically insignificantin states with a relatively high level of urbanisation or development. In contrast, theeffect of economic complexity is prominent only in states that have levels of urbanisationand development above the median values. This suggests that diversity is a particularlyimportant factor influencing the distribution of income in states at relatively early stagesof development, whereas economic complexity takes over this role in states that havesurpassed a certain level of development.6. Summary and ConclusionsWith the introduction of the concept of economic complexity, the research strandinvestigating the impact of productive structures on structural transformation and eco-Sustainability 2021, 13, 1006 19 of 23nomic growth has received an important impetus. In particular, there is growing evidencethat countries that are involved in the production and export of complex products arecharacterised by higher average growth rates and that increases in economic complexitylead to faster economic growth.Most recently, this research strand has started to widen its scope by investigating theimpact of economic complexity on the income distribution within countries. Economiccomplexity is linked to a multitude of factors including factor endowments, knowledge,the availability of job opportunities and the quality of institutions. This suggests thatmore complex productive structures will exercise positive effects on the distribution ofincome, generating the hypothesis that economic complexity is negatively associated withincome inequality. Given the small number of studies that look at this relationship and theheterogeneity of the available evidence, more research into this relationship is urgentlyrequired.The purpose of this paper is to contribute to and extend upon this emerging researchstrand, adding to the literature in the following three ways. First, in contrast to existingstudies that look at the relationship between economic complexity and income inequalityin cross-country frameworks, our study investigates this at the regional level in Brazil. Ourfocus on the regional dimension is linked with the notion that many of the factors that aredirectly connected to economic complexity can be subject to substantial heterogeneity acrossregions, warranting empirical research on the impact of regional productive structures onthe income distribution of regions.Second, in line with the concept of the Kuznets curve, we examine whether therelationship between economic complexity and income inequality is characterised bynon-linearity. Initial increases of economic complexity may disproportionally benefit high-skilled workers, generating increased inequality. With ongoing increases of economiccomplexity, other components of productive structures that lower inequality may becomemore important, resulting in a negative impact on income inequality at higher levels ofcomplexity.Third, Brazil is a country that—whilst having a level of economic development thatclassifies it as a lower- or upper-middle income—is facing high levels of poverty andinequality. As such, it is representative of a substantial group of countries in the worldeconomy that find themselves in a similar situation and whose governments are searchingfor ways to implement policies that promote economic development whilst also impactinglevels of poverty and inequality.Using panel data for 27 federative units for the period 2002–2014, we obtain evidencein support of the notion that the relationship between economic complexity and incomeinequality has an inverted U-shape. Controlling for a number of drivers of income inequal-ity, our pooled OLS estimations show a significant negative effect of economic complexityand a significant positive effect of its squared term on two different measures of incomeinequality. In extension, given the low variability of the main variables over the years, werely on random effects estimations to capture time-invariant effects. With this estimator,although the statistical significance of the estimated effects of economic complexity isaffected in some specifications, the nature of the estimated effect of the two economiccomplexity variables remains the same, in further support of the inverted U-shaped natureof the relationship. Other factors that play an important role as drivers of income inequalityin Brazilian states include GDP per capita, human capital and the regional importance ofthe informal sector.Next, our findings show that the effect of economic complexity on income distributionis affected by the level of development of the regions. When estimating the regressionmodels separately for regions with low or high levels of urbanisation or GDP per capita, thenon-linear relationship between economic complexity and income inequality materialises inthose regions characterised by relatively high levels of these two indicators. An explanationfor this finding is that a certain level of development needs to be reached before the regionalproductive structure starts to exercise meaningful effects on income inequality.Sustainability 2021, 13, 1006 20 of 23The indicator of economic complexity is based on international exports by regionsbased on revealed comparative advantage.
