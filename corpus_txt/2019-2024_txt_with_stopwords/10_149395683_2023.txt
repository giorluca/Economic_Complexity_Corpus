While neo-classical economics has beenhighly effective in profit and consumption maximization, it falls short regardingbroader definitions of societal well-being and sustainable growth. This Ph.D. the-sis aims to address some of these limitations by providing an interdisciplinaryapproach integrating complex networks and data science tools in economics. Inparticular, we pursue two research inquiries. First, we explore the sources of eco-nomic growth through the creation and spreading of productive knowledge to un-derstand the key levers that contribute to the productivity of nations. To that end,we use network-based measures of social capital to understand how productiveknowledge spreads across nations and how this impacts economic performance.And second, we study how Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factorscan be integrated into markets, and the current issues blocking such integration.To overcome these issues, we leverage statistical and network-based models toanalyze corporate greenhouse gas emissions, and reveal existing quality issues inthe data. In this way, we tackle a common challenge in both areas: the lack ofquality indicators to capture the complexities of such problems. By bridging thegap between traditional economic frameworks and modern tools and methods, wecan better understand the sources of economic growth and integrate ESG factors,ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and prosperous society.11. INTRODUCTIONThe 2018 Nobel Prize in economics recognized the development of the neo-classical economic framework for modeling the long-term growth of the globaleconomy, as well as the inclusion of climate change into the model. This intro-ductory chapter sets the stage for the following chapters by outlining these twokey points. On the one hand, we examine the link between economic growthand the creation and accumulation of productive knowledge. While modern ap-proaches such as the Economic Complexity Index have successfully quantifiedthis stock of knowledge, we still need to account for its mobility. Secondly, weexplore how climate change has been integrated into neoclassical growth models,including proposals to incorporate externalities caused by greenhouse gas emis-sions, such as the ESG investing framework. However, one major weakness of thisframework is the lack of quality information on corporate behavior regarding thisissue. Throughout this chapter, we highlight the potential for interdisciplinary ap-proaches using complex networks and data science to bridge some of the existinggaps in the field of economics.2The Haywain Triptych, central panel. Hieronymus Bosch.31.1. Challenges of present consumption as the main indicator of societal well-beingThe word economics comes from the Greek words oικoς [oikos], meaning "fam-ily, household, estate," and νoµoς [nomos], or "custom, law," and hence literallymeans management of the household. Perhaps a more modern definition wouldbe the branch of social sciences that studies the production, distribution, and con-sumption of goods and services.The mainstream neoclassical economic thought considers living standards tobe equivalent to the number of goods and services consumed [1]. According tothe Friedman doctrine, businesses are only responsible for utilizing their resourcesand engaging in activities aimed at increasing their profits [2]. This responsibilityapplies as long as they operate in a fair and open competition without resortingto deceit or fraud. Based on this premise, economic theory has been developedemphasizing the number of goods and services produced and consumed as theprimary magnitude of study (i.e. accounting approach). For instance, macroe-conomics has focused on explaining the total value of final goods and servicesproduced, also known as Gross Domestic Product (GDP).However, it is essential to note that increased consumption does not alwaystranslate to improved health standards, life expectancy, social equality, economicstability, or other factors contributing to overall well-being. The question thatarises then is how to measure and enhance societal well-being beyond consump-tion maximization. Investors, policymakers, and consumers can influence com-panies differently to achieve better societal outcomes. Investors might allocatecapital to companies aligning better with their preferences. Policymakers can reg-ulate (or incentivize) companies that deviate (or align) with the desired behaviors.And consumers can shift their demand toward companies that align better withtheir values. In all of those cases, complete information about the decision athand is crucial.Numerous efforts have been made to improve the neoclassical economic frame-work in this aspect. In fact, the Nobel Prize in Economics 2018 recognized thedesign of models for the long-term development of the global economy and thewelfare of its citizens, with a particular emphasis on climate change. Paul M.Romer contributed to this goal by providing tools to comprehend the relationship4between future long-term economic growth and society’s technological capabili-ties [3–5]. Meanwhile, William D. Nordhaus developed a framework that explainsthe interdependence between the economy and the planet’s climate [6]. These twocontributions are the cornerstones of our work.On the one hand, we further explore the above-mentioned relationship be-tween economic performance and technological capabilities. Since GDP onlycharacterizes present economic performance, we need indicators to understandthe growth of well-being into the future [7]. As discussed in Section 1.2, the en-dogenous growth literature points to technology and innovation as the ultimatesources of economic growth. However, these factors still remain hard to measureusing classical methodologies. In this work, we build on the Economic Com-plexity theory of productive knowledge and examine its propagation across theglobe. To do this we leverage complex network science to study the mobility ofproductive knowledge through the interconnected global economy and its impacton economic performance.On the other hand, we acknowledge that present subjective well-being is sig-nificantly influenced by non-material factors [8, 9]. Likewise, societal well-beingencompasses several other indicators beyond material living standards [10], in-cluding environmental aspects (e.g., global warming, biodiversity, land degrada-tion, water usage, toxic waste), social factors (e.g., inequality, access to healthcareand education, social capital, labor conditions), and governance matters (e.g., thejustice system, security, corruption, human rights). Various alternative indica-tors to GDP have been suggested in the literature, such as the Human Develop-ment Index, the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), and the Subjective Well-Being(SWB) [11]. However, these indicators are computed at the national level anddon’t provide a framework for anybody other than policymakers to take action.Investors and consumers can also exercise influence on companies to achieve bet-ter societal outcomes. As explained in Section 1.3, we still lack quality and gran-ularity in the underlying information that is needed to calculate such crucial indi-cators. As we will explain further, our work focuses on the environmental aspect,demonstrating how statistical inference, machine learning, and economic networkdata can assist in filling the corporate emissions information gap to provide qualityindicators.51.2. Explaining long-run economic growthThe first piece of our work focuses on studying productive knowledge as the mainsource of economic growth. In section 1.2.1 we provide an overview of endoge-nous growth models and their main prediction: apart from population dynamics,economic growth is mainly driven by the productive capabilities of society, whichare mainly determined by technological progress. In section 1.2.2 we describehow recent developments in Economic Complexity link the productive knowl-edge held by societies to the structure of the bi-partite network of products andcountries. In section 1.2.3 we reveal the first research question of this study: howwe can build indicators of productive knowledge mobility on the global economicnetwork and how this process impacts economic output through productivity in-creases.1.2.1. Endogenous growth models in EconomicsFrom the dawn of Economics, production theory described economic output as afunction of the factors of production—land, labor, and capital—plus an additionalterm called Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to account for any additional unknownfactors [12]. The so-called aggregate production function is defined as:Y(t) = F [K(t), L(t) · A(t)] (1.1)where Y(t) is the total amount of production of the final good at time t, K(t)is the capital stock, L(t) is total employment, A(t) is technology at time t—
alsoknown as Total Factor Productivity (TFP)—and F is the production function. Atypical assumption is that ∂F/∂· > 0, since more inputs (capital, labor, and/orproductivity) will lead to more production. Decreasing marginal returns are alsocommonly assumed (∂2F/∂·2 < 0), since the gain from one more unit of inputsdecreases at higher input levels [5]. This assumption is also known as the law ofdiminishing returns [13].Based on these ideas, one of the most relevant macroeconomic growth modelsis the Sollow-Swan model [14]. Under a series of assumptions that fall out of thescope of this thesis, the model predicts that economies converge to a balanced-growth equilibrium regardless of their starting point. In this situation, the growthof output per capita is determined solely by the rate of technological progress.6That is, the economy per capita grows as much as technological progress, and thistechnological progress is left out as an exogenous parameter [5].Neo-classical endogenous growth models (such as the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmansmodel) build upon the Sollow-Swan approach and improve different dimensions.Instead of assuming a constant saving rate, this new generation of models findsthe Pareto-optimal equilibrium, where optimal consumption C(t) is endogenouslymodeled based on consumers maximizing their present and future utilities [15].Very succinctly, we can describe the optimal growth problem in continuous timeas follows:max[c(t),k(t)]∞t=0∫︂ ∞oe−ρ·tu(c(t))dt (1.2)subject to:∂k(t)∂t= f (k(t)) − c(t) − δk(t) (1.3)where ρ represents time discounting, δ represents capital depreciation, u(c) isthe monotonically increasing utility function, and c(t) = C(t)/A(t)L(t), k(t) =K(t)/A(t)L(t), and f (k(t)) = F[K(t)/A(t)L(t)] are consumption, capital, and pro-duction per unit of effective labor. It can be shown [16] that the solution to thisproblem comes from pinning the steady-state value of the normalized capital k∗f ′(k∗) = ρ + δ + θdA(t)dt(1.4)where the θ parameter controls the magnitude of the impact that increases in pro-ductive knowledge have. In that case, the optimal level of consumption per capita:C(t)∗L(t)=[︄f (k∗) −(︄n + δ +dA(t)dt)︄k∗]︄· A(t) (1.5)One of the main predictions of this model is that the only way to increase con-sumption per capita is to increase A(t). In other words, to understand future eco-nomic growth, we must understand technological growth.Subsequent work from Romer described total factor productivity as a func-tion of technology and human capital, where the latter is a distinct measure of thecumulative effect of activities like formal education and on-the-job training [3].Different theoretical extensions have been proposed since [17–19], but the con-clusions remain mostly the same. First, increases in productivity through technol-ogy and knowledge – or productive knowledge hereafter – determine the growth7rate. Second, since knowledge spreading is a positive sum, integration into worldmarkets will increase growth rates.The underlying reality of this process is very intricate. Innovation Economicsentails a series of phenomena including pairwise knowledge exchanges betweennations, knowledge creation feedback loops, heterogeneity of productive capa-bilities. This is the canonical problem for complexity science to study: a sys-tem where the sum of the parts does not explain the whole system’s behavior.Therefore, the next section outlines how complexity science has studied produc-tive knowledge accumulation across nations.1.2.2. Economic Complexity as a measure of productive knowledgeComplexity science has been able to answer long-standing questions in Economics,such as the contagion of financial crises, the emergence of economic bubbles, andthe observation of power laws in economic data[20, 21]. In recent years, com-plexity science has gained prominence in economic modeling, with approachesranging from econophysics [22–24] to Agent-based models (ABMs)[25–27]. Yetthe field of Economic Complexity has successfully contributed to explaining eco-nomic growth [28, 29].Cesar Hidalgo and Ricardo Hausmann’s work stands out as one of the mostsignificant contributions toward measuring the knowledge content of an econ-omy [28, 29]. Their pioneering work put forth the Economic Complexity Index(ECI) as a novel indicator that quantifies the volume of productive knowledge inan economy. It has proven to be highly effective in explaining economic growth.This undertaking was accomplished by drawing on the aforementioned economicprinciples and supplementing them with complexity science tools.The Economic Complexity field asserts that knowledge and information arecritical drivers of economic performance [29]. Markets and organizations facili-tate the transfer of knowledge from the few to the many, and the difficulty in trans-ferring tacit knowledge constrains economic growth. Complex products requireindividuals with diverse capabilities to collaborate, and for society to progressand sustain itself, experts in various areas such as design, marketing, finance,technology, and trade law must combine their knowledge to create products. Thecomposition of a country’s productive output reflects the structures that emerge8to combine and hold knowledge, and this is expressed through economic com-plexity. As neoclassical Economics deduces, economic development is driven byproductive knowledge, that in this case is expressed as complexity.The bi-partite network of products and countries – who is producing what– can be used to study the spectrum of productive capabilities in each country.Therefore, Hidalgo and Hausmann propose to use it to estimte the EconomicComplexity of nations. The adjacency matrix M for the country-product networkis indexed by c for countries and p for products. The matrix element Mcp = 1 ifcountry c has a revealed comparative advantage (RCA) > 1 in product p, whereRCA is calculated using the Balassa index [30]:RCAcp =xcp/∑︁p xcp∑︁c xcp/∑︁cp xcp(1.6)where xcp is country c’s exports of product p. Mcp = 0 otherwise.The method of reflections is the original algorithm to proxy economic com-plexity, and it is based on the diversity and ubiquity of an economy’s products [28].These two are crude approximations of the variety of capabilities available in acountry or required by a product. Diverse capabilities allow countries to makeall products, so only the most diversified countries can make the least ubiquitousproducts. Mathematically these concepts can be expressed as follows; If we defineMcp, as a matrix that is 1 if the country c produces product p, and 0 otherwise, wecan measure diversity and ubiquity simply by summing over the rows or columnsof that matrix. Formally, we define:Diversity = kc,0 =∑︂pMcp (1.7)Ubiquity = kp,0 =∑︂cMcp (1.8)We want to account for the fact that countries that produce the least ubiquitousproducts hold more knowledge. And the most knowledge-intensive products areonly built by the most diversified countries. For countries, we calculate the av-erage ubiquity of the products it exports. For products, we calculate the averagediversity of the countries that produce them. We can express this in the following9recursive expression:kc,N =1∑︁p Mcp∑︂pMcp · kp,N−1 (1.9)kp,N =1∑︁c Mcp∑︂cMcp · kc,N−1 (1.10)We substitute one equation into the other, to obtain:kc,N =1kc,0∑︂pMcp ·1kp,0∑︂c′Mc′p · kc′,N−2 (1.11)kc,N =∑︂c′Mc′p · kc′,N−2∑︂pMcpMc′pkc,0kp,0(1.12)and further express this as:kc,N =∑︂c′˜︁Mcc′kc′,N−2 (1.13)˜︁Mcc′ =∑︂pMcpMc′pkc,0kp,0(1.14)The solution for the last expression can be obtained by diagonalizing the co-exporting matrix Mcc′ . However, because Mcc′ is row-stochastic (∑︁c′ Mcc′ = 1)—all of this can be interpreted as a Markov process—the first eigenvector is a vectorof 1s, making the second eigenvector the leading metric of economic complex-ity[31].Usually, the values are standardized so that the final definition of the EconomicComplexity Index (ECI) is:ECIc =Kc − Kc¯σ(Kc)(1.15)where Kc¯ and σ(Kc) are the average and the standard deviation of Kc. As a refer-ence, we show the map of ECI values by country for 2020 in Figure 1.1.Extensive literature has contributed to Economic Complexity in recent years [32].From the mathematical point of view, ECI can be interpreted as a spectral clus-tering of the similarities between countries’ export patterns [31]. But ECI is notjust a theoretical tool, since it has proven to be related to economic growth [28](see Figure 1.2), lower levels of income inequality [33, 34], and more recently tocomparatively lower emissions [35, 36].10Figure 1.1: Economic Complexity Index global map for the year 2020. Source:Observatory of economic complexityFigure 1.2: Relationship between the annualized GDP per capita growth for theperiod between 1998 and 2008 and the Economic Complexity Index for 1998,after taking into account the initial level of income and the increase in natural re-source exports during that period – in constant dollars as a share of initial GDP.On average, scholars find that an increase of one standard deviation in economiccomplexity, at the same level of GDP per capita, is associated with an increase inannualized growth of between 4% to 7%. Source: Atlas of Economic Complex-ity [29].11The method of reflections was later reformulated to move towards more effi-cient and direct non-linear fixpoint algorithms to rank countries and products inthe global market [37]. As a result, the Economic fitness index was proposed toaccount for the fact that countries with low fitness should have more weight inbounding the product complexity [38]. This Economic fitness indicator outper-forms the International Monetary Fund GDP forecasts, and it can be found in theworld bank’s database under the metric code EF.EFM.UNIV.XD [39].There are two main takeaways from the contributions of economic complexity.First, complexity science methods add value to mainstream economic theory. In-dicators extracted from the network structure of the economy provide valuable in-sights into economic growth. Second, while economic complexity has succeededin illustrating the amount of productive knowledge that an economy holds, it issilent on how that knowledge flows between countries. As mentioned in section1.2.1, integration into world markets is expected to increase growth rates.However, it is not straightforward to quantify the level of integration of a na-tion into world markets. The global economy is a very interdependent systemwhere a particular nation depends not only on its direct trade partners, but on thepartners of the partners and so on. It suffices to look at the state of world sup-ply chains over the past few years to provide a brief picture of the intricacy athand. For instance, in Figure 1.3, we show the value of imports different countriesbought from Russia during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine invasion –relative to January 2019.Therefore the spread of productive knowledge through the global economycan be thought of as a system with many agents (nations) interacting with eachother, where the whole system is more than the sum of its parts. This fits thedefinition of Complex Systems [41]. The next section provides an overview of theliterature interpreting supply chains as complex networks.1.2.3. Complex networks in economics and social capitalTo better understand knowledge mobility patterns across countries, it is advanta-geous to view the global economy as a complex network [42]. Within this frame-work, nodes represent countries and edges represent various types of interactionsbetween them such as trade or migration.12Figure 1.3: Value of total imports from Russia of different countries relative toJanuary 2019. We observe huge changes under two major events: the COVID-19pandemic and the start of the Ukraine invasion. Source: Observatory of EconomicComplexity[40].Complex networks have already been applied to study diverse economic phe-nomena, such as the transmission of financial contagion, the formation of eco-nomic bubbles, and the emergence of power laws in economic data [20, 21]. Onearea of research has focused on production networks, which are networks wherenodes represent economic agents such as countries, industries, and firms, and thelinks represent economic transactions [43]. These networks have been studiedextensively to understand their structural properties in both global inter-countrytrade [44–47] and company networks [48–50]. Interestingly, economic transac-tions serve as a mechanism for information propagation, as the two sides mustinteract with each other. Similarly, global migration exhibits a complex networkstructure [51–53] and provides a mechanism for information exchange. Moreover,recent advances in graph machine learning [54–57] have allowed for unprece-dented accuracy in economic network reconstruction tasks.An important contribution linking social sciences and networks is the semi-nal work of Jackson, linking network centrality measures to social capital types[58]. This concept has mainly been tested on social networks, linking social cap-ital to information diffusion [59], innovation [60], and even personal economic13Imports Growth Value from Russia in USD* $68 $58 Q) ::J g $48 .c j 0 $38 ~ Q) $28 ::J g $18 CJ) t 0 a. $0 E -$18 -$28 Jan Apr Jui Oct 2020 Apr Jui Oct 2021 Apr Jui Oct Apr Jui Oct 2019 Covid pandemic Invasion of Ukraine prosperity [61].The first contribution of our work is born in this context. Chapter 2 exploresthe question of how productive knowledge spreads via global trade and migrationnetworks. This is accomplished by interpreting the centrality of countries withinthese networks as expressions of social capital. Moreover, we demonstrate theeffect of these social capital expressions on countries’ economic performance.1.3. Alternative dimensions of societal well-being: Including Environmental,Social and Governance issues into the mixThe second pillar of this thesis is based on the need to broaden the scope of societalwell-being’s definition. By focusing only on pure consumption we ignore envi-ronmental factors such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption,waste management, and biodiversity loss, social factors such as human rights, in-equality, health, and education, and governance factors such as democratic qual-ity, corruption, freedom of speech, and justice. This section outlines how marketsfail to incorporate these Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) indicators,and presents current proposals to address such failures. Section 1.3.1 examines thecase of climate change and the shortcomings of current pricing mechanisms. Sec-tion 1.3.2 explores the ESG financial framework as an alternative pricing mecha-nism that has gained popularity in recent years. Section 1.3.3 discusses the chal-lenges associated with this approach due to the amount and quality of availableinformation. To conclude we present the research questions covered in Chapters3 and 4, which aim to bridge the gap between ESG markets and data.1.3.1. When markets fail to find the social optima - The case of climate changeAmong all of the ESG concerns, climate change is perhaps one of the most con-cerning today. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) has conducted an extensive analysis of climate change risks and impactsin their 6th assessment report [62]. They conclude that there is compelling evi-dence of human activities rapidly warming the atmosphere, ocean, and land at anunprecedented rate (see Figure 1.4). And a near-linear relationship between cu-mulative CO2 emissions and the increase in global surface temperature has been14Figure 1.4: History of global temperature change and causes of recent warming.There is overwhelming evidence for unprecedented global warming, as well as forhuman activity’s fundamental contribution to the issue. Sourced directly from the6th IPCC report [62].identified as the main cause. Consequently, extreme hot temperature events, whichoccurred every 50 years before the pre-industrial era, are now predicted to occur8.6 times more frequently under the 1.5º warming scenario of the Paris Agree-ment. And despite the reduction of CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050, it isestimated that we will likely reach that warming level.As concerns for climate change continue to rise [63], it is becoming increas-ingly clear that markets fail to integrate society’
s preferences in this aspect, lead-ing to what is known as a market failure. In such a scenario, the distribution ofgoods and services is not Pareto-efficient, meaning that the best societal outcomeis not achieved through separate individual strategies. Economists have identifiedvarious forms of market failures, such as public goods[64], information asymme-tries [65], and externalities [66].Climate change can be considered a public good [67], as the environmentalconditions necessary for societal well-being are shared among all humans on theplanet. This creates what is known as the "tragedy of the commons" [68], whereindividuals tend to act as free-riders, not taking any action to preserve the envi-15Changes in global surface temperature relative to 1850-1900 (a) Change in global surface temperature (decadal average) as reconstructed (1- 2000) and observed (1850- 2020) •c 2.0 Warming is unprecedented in more than 2000 years \\ 1.5 ~ Warmest multi·century ./ period in more than l.O 1 1 0 100,000 years ) observed 05 0.2 ~00 ·' I reconstructed - 0.5 - 1 1 500 1000 1500 1850 2020 (b) Change in global surface temperature (annual average) as observed and simulated using human & natural and only natural factors (both 1850- 2020) •c 2.0 1.5 observed simulated 1.0 human& natural 0.5 simulated 0.0 natural only (solar& volcanic) - 0.5 1850 1900 1950 2000 2020 ronment while relying on the efforts of others. However, collective action towardreducing emissions would lead to a better overall outcome for society. Currently,greenhouse gas emissions are not priced into the markets, resulting in an absenceof incentives to reduce emissions.Nordhaus is a seminal figure who paved the way for introducing carbon pricingmechanisms into the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model described in section 1.2.1,thus enabling long-term interactions between society and climate to be captured[6]. Nordhaus began his work on Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) in the1970s [69, 70], and his research culminated in the development of the DICE model(Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy)[67, 71]. Since then, theDICE model has undergone substantial development[72]. The model includes 20equations that model the budget constraint – expressed in equation 1.3 – to repre-sent the intricate interactions between the economy, carbon emissions, ecologicalimpacts, and environmental policy (Figure 1.5). The DICE model provides thefoundation for the IAMs used by the IPCC. And it can be used to predict the im-pact of climate change under different policy scenarios and to identify the model’ssensitivity to uncertain parameters.Figure 1.5: The Circular Flow of Global Warming Science, Impacts, and Policy.Nordhaus introduced such interactions in the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model’sbudget constraint to account for interactions between climate and the economy.Sourced directly from [73]The DICE model predicts that emitters must internalize the external costs of16carbon emissions to achieve a decentralized market equilibrium. How this inter-nalization is achieved remains uncertain, but proposed tools include carbon taxes,emissions trading systems, and carbon crediting mechanisms. Despite this, theWorld Bank reports that only 25% of global emissions in 2022 were covered bycarbon pricing instruments [74]. And while the US government estimates a socialcost of $51 per tonne of CO2, most recent estimates are around $185 per tonne ofCO2 [75]. But these prices are far from what we need to fix global warming [76].In addition to carbon emissions, many societal issues are not currently re-flected in the consumption approach from neoclassical Economics. This high-lights the need for a comprehensive framework to incorporate Environmental, So-cial, and Governance (ESG) issues into markets. While some regulatory effortshave been made, the proposed solutions to date have been limited and ineffective.Therefore in the next section, we discuss how the ESG investing framework offersan alternative pricing mechanism.1.3.2. ESG markets as an alternative pricing mechanismThe ESG investing framework is an alternative pricing mechanism that has gainedpopularity in recent years (see Figure 1.6). The idea is that non-financial informa-tion should be considered when investors make their financial decisions, so thatbad ESG performers are penalized via lower financial valuations1.To date, investors have cared mainly about financial materiality, which is basedon metrics related to the company’s financial performance such as revenue, profit,or capital expenditure among others [80]. Consequently, omitting or misstatingthe financial metrics of the company is considered fraud [81, 82]. On the contrary,to price ESG issues, stakeholder materiality relates to the impact of the company’sactivities on stakeholders (e.g., governments, employees, customers, NGOs, andcommunities) [83]. In this way, ESG investing connects financial and stakeholdermaterialities into one: double materiality. Through this mechanism, investors1The idea started as the field of corporate responsibility in the 1950s [77]. And there has beena trend ever since on moving away from shareholder’s interests to also take other stakeholders –consumers, employees, investors – into account [78]. The term ESG first emerged in the financeliterature and mainly targeted business investors. It was first coined in the report “Who CaresWins: Connecting Financial Markets to a Changing World,” compiled by UN Global Compactand published in December 2004 [79].17Figure 1.6: Google Trend’s Interest Over Time on different carbon pricing mech-anisms. We observe a dominant (and still growing) interest in ESG as opposed toother carbon pricing mechanisms. Numbers represent global search interest rela-tive to the highest point on the chart for the given time.price the risks and opportunities around changing ESG trends in society and theenvironment while maximizing stakeholder interests.The evidence for the relationship between ESG and financial performance ismixed. One recent meta-study revealed that 90% of the analyzed literature con-tributions reported a positive relationship between financial performance and thepropensity to tilt portfolios towards ESG stocks[84]. Furthermore, this relation-ship could look smaller than it is due to the noise in ESG data [85]. Nonethe-less, another meta-study [86] comparing ethical funds to conventional ones didnot find significant differences in Sharpe ratio, average returns, or diversificationmeasures. And another investigation [87] found that only one in three studiesindicates superior performance. Some studies even support a carbon premiumhypothesis [88], where investing in polluting firms provides both higher risk andreturns. Nevertheless, on top of financial performance, some investors might in-vest in greener assets exclusively for ethical reasons—what is known as impactinvesting[89]. Impact investing has surged in the last years, although it has beenestimated that less than one-third of impact funds have an actual additional im-pact [90]. And recent advances in IAM models including the feedback loop be-18100 80 -"' [I:' 2 60 C QJ > .:; 40 "' a:; a'. 20 0 Google Trends interest by topic Environmental, social, and corporate governance Carbon tax Carbon credit Emissions trading 2019 2020 2021 Time 2022 2023 tween ESG investing and the climate stress scenarios show consistent results [91].Investors are not the only ones pushing for ESG investing. On the one hand,incoming policies such as the EU Taxonomy or the SFDR are forcing investorsto disclose the sustainability of their investments. In fact, the CSRD regulationwill force up to 50k European companies to publish sustainability reporting from2025 [92]. On the other, companies are increasingly incentivized to disclose ESGinformation to drive the stability of their financial performance in the long run[93].Despite the increasing materiality of ESG rating, that impact on the real econ-omy has been limited so far [94]. Stakeholder material metrics are still not ofmandatory disclosure, so the quality of the existing self-reported data is at leastquestionable [95]. Therefore while ESG markets could solve the market fail-ures caused by externalities, there still could be an asymmetric information failurewhere investors don’t have complete information on the ESG metrics needed.1.3.3. The ESG data gapFor ESG investing to work, the first step is to have relevant ESG information aboutthe major organizations in the economy. Yet, the primary source of ESG data inthe market is self-disclosed corporate sustainability reports. ESG disclosures [96,97], and in particular emissions disclosures [98], are mainly determined by threefactors: economic, ecological, regulatory, and management. Economic factorssuch as firm size favor disclosure. From the ecological point of view, more in-tensive industries report more. Regulations push on sustainability reporting. Andmanagement practices such as good financial or past ESG reporting drive disclo-sures.The collection and consolidation of all the reports is done by several ratingagencies. Some are big institutions such as Bloomberg, FTSE, MSC, Refinitiv,and Standard & Poor’s. But we also find smaller organizations participating in thisspace: Sustainalytics (acquired by Morningstar), Truvalue (acquired by Factset),Vigeo EIRIS (acquired by Moody’s), ISS (acquired by Deutsche Borse), and someremaining independent projects such as Carbon4, RepRisk, Carbon DisclosureProject (CDP) and Clarity AI.Using the ESG data, the different rating agencies build ESG scores, which19are measures of ESG performance2. Ideally, ESG scores contain sufficient infor-mation for decision-makers to price them into the markets. However, the rapidevolution and maturity status of the field [99], together with the diversity of dataproviders introduces undesired effects. The seminal work of R. Rigobon [95]shows a significant divergence in ESG scores across ESG rating agencies, wherethe maximum pairwise correlation between any two raters is 0.71—main sourcesof discrepancy being differences in measurement, scope, and weight. Moreover,ESG scores of certain agencies have been shown to change retroactively overtime [100].For the case of GHG emissions – perhaps one of the most material ESG met-rics – we find three main factors affecting the measurement problem:• Data availability: as previously mentioned, incomplete information can cre-ate market inefficiencies. In the year 2021, only 4.5k listed companies re-ported GHG emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire. Asa reference, there are more than 50k listed companies globally. Thereforemissing data is a big part of the problem. Recent efforts have been putinto filling in the gaps with imputation methods based on machine learn-ing. Based on the company’s fundamentals, it’s possible to estimate theemissions [101–103], or the ESG scores directly [104, 105]. However, thisapproach can potentially inherit any biases present in the reported data ifnot done carefully.• Complexity: the mere definition of ESG metrics already poses some chal-lenges. For example regarding company emissions, the Green House Gas(GHG) Protocol’s definition of carbon footprint[106]—the primary globalstandard for GHG emissions measuring—separates direct emissions fromthe organization (Scope 1), indirect emissions due to the consumption ofelectricity (Scope 2), and the rest of indirect emissions (Scope 3) [107].Scope 3 emissions themselves follow a 17-category taxonomy distinguish-ing between upstream and downstream categories (see Figure 1.7). Scope3 is the largest part, but the hardest to calculate [108]. And the networkedstructure of the economy makes the calculation harder (see chapter 4).2There are many different frameworks for building ESG scores. Some scores are built aroundthe financial risks of ESG matters, while others focus on the organizations’ actual impact on theworld.20• Greenwashing: companies have low incentives to reveal the correct infor-mation. A third party does not necessarily audit the sustainability reports —only 38.5% did for their emissions report in the 2021 CDP questionnaire—so their validity is at least questionable. Corporate declarations about en-vironmental performance leadership have seen a sharp increase in recentyears, as has the amount of literature pointing to greenwashing practices [109].Evidence shows that US consumer goods companies tend to under-reportgreenhouse gas emissions[110] and that the top environmental perform-ers are the ones disclosing better environmental information[111]. Recentcontributions also show that some firms adhering to sustainable initiatives(GRI, UNGC) fail to improve environmental impact substantively after do-ing so [112].Figure 1.7: Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions types as defined by the Greenhouse GasProtocol. Note that Scope 3 emissions can be further divided into upstream –with 8 sub-categories – and downstream – with 7 sub-categories. Image directlysourced from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Technical Guidance for CalculatingScope 3 Emissions [107].There is a need for better corporate emissions data sets. In this thesis, wetackle such a task by leveraging different tools from the Data Science and Com-21plex Systems toolboxes. First, in Chapter 3 we study firms’ direct – or Scope 1– emissions. Such emissions are currently modeled in the industry through vari-ous machine-learning approaches. In our work, we study some of the underlyingbiases in the data used to train these algorithms. Then, in Chapter 4 we return tothe complex network interpretation of the economy to model firms’ indirect – orScope 3 – emissions.22The rest of this work is structured as follows. In chapter 2 we discuss ourcontributions to linking the network structure of the global migration and tradenetworks to the social capital of countries, and how it helps the spread of produc-tive knowledge, and thus to economic growth [113]. In the following two chapters,we turn to describe our contributions to the ESG data gap. Chapter 3 studies thequality of corporate direct emissions – or Scope 1 – data, with a particular focuson the drivers of reporting, auditing, and reduction. Then, in chapter 4 we goback to the network interpretation of the economy to study corporate indirect –or Scope 3 – emissions and the issues related to them. Finally, we provide someconclusions and future work.232. ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A NETWORKED GLOBALECONOMYUnderstanding the drivers of economic growth is of utmost importance for thefield of economics. Prior studies have recognized the critical roles of the factorsof production, namely capital and labor. However, the precise mechanisms un-derlying Total Factor Productivity (TFP) are not fully comprehended. A growingbody of literature suggests that the creation and transmission of knowledge, fac-tor supply, and economic integration are crucial components of TFP. Nonetheless,there remains a need for a comprehensive and unifying framework in this regard.In the present-day economic context, capital and labor are enmeshed in a complexnetwork structure through global supply chains and international migration. Re-cent research has identified a link between network centralities and various formsof social capital. In this study, we employ the OECD’s Multi-Regional Input-Output and International Migration datasets to construct network representationsfor capital and labor across 63 economies over ten years. We then explore the roleof social capital measures as drivers of TFP, utilizing an extended Cobb-Douglasproduction function and addressing potential issues such as multicollinearity, re-verse causality, and non-linear effects. Our findings indicate that social capitalwithin the factors of production networks can significantly drive economic out-puts through TFP.24The water lily pond. Claude Monet.252.1. IntroductionFrom the seminal work of Solow [14], economic output has been understood as amonotonically increasing function of the factors of production—land, labor, andcapital—plus an additional term called Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to accountfor any additional unknown factors. Although TFP has been found to be the keydeterminant of the long-run growth rate (per worker) [15], its drivers remain un-clear.From the exogenous TFP models from Solow [14], the end
