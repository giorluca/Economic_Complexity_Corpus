In the present study, we selected thePosidonius FCC to explore the mineralogy, morphology and tectonic characteristics using remotesensing datasets. The Posidonius crater is vested with a wide moat of lava separating the crater riminner wall terraces from the fractured central floor. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s (LRO) imagesand Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used to map the tectonics and morphology of thepresent study. The Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) data of Chandrayaan-1 were used to investigatethe mineralogy of the region through specified techniques such as integrated band depth, bandcomposite and spectral characterization. The detailed mineralogical analysis indicates the noritic-richmaterials in one massif among four central peak rings and confirm intrusion (mafic pluton). Spectralanalysis from the fresh crater of the Posidonius moat mare unit indicates clinopyroxene pigeonitein nature. Integrated studies of the mineralogy, morphology and tectonics revealed that the studyregion belongs to the Class-III category of FFCs. The lithospheric loading by adjacent volcanic load(Serenitatis basin) generates a stress state and distribution of the fracture system.Keywords: lunar; Posidonius impact crater; floor fractured crater; lunar morphology; mineralogy;spectral analysis1. IntroductionThe impact cratering process and volcanism are two major geological processes of theMoon that shape its surface morphological features. A crater is a circular depression formeddue to the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body, i.e., meteoroids [1,2]. Impact crateringprocesses are not only restricted to the Moon but are also found on the surfaces of otherplanetary bodies of the solar system [3]. In contrast to impact craters, volcanic processesalso lead to circular depressions, but their formation is related to explosions or internalcollapse. The Moon is vested with enormous impact craters on the surface ranging fromsmall-sized simple craters to large complex craters/multi-ringed basins. The size of cratersrange from micrometers to more than 2500 km [4]. The morphology of an impact craterdepends upon several factors, such as the size of the specific crater, rheological properties,and the erosional and degradational processes of the planetary surface [2,5].The near-earth objects (NEO), namely asteroids and comets, present in the mainasteroid belt (between Mars and Jupiter), bombard the Moon and other terrestrial bodies ofRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 814. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14040814 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensingRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 2 of 18the solar system and develop craters on the surface of the Moon [6]. In this context, lunarfloor-fractured craters (FFCs) are a distinguished type of crater found on the surface ofthe Moon with radial, concentric, and/or polygonal fractures on their floor [7,8]. FFCs’development mechanisms are related to magmatic near surface intrusion, leading to theformation of a shallow sill or viscous relaxation [7–15]. The recent studies strongly indicatethat FFC formation is due to magmatic intrusion and sill formation [8,16,17]. Schultzet al. categorized these FFC lunar craters into six classes based on their morphologicalcharacteristics using Lunar Orbiter (LO) photographs [7].Furthermore, Jozwiak et al. (2012) analyzed the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA)and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) to characterize their morphologicalfeatures and map their distribution around the moon [8]. Among these data, a few FFCswere investigated based on morphology, mineralogy, and chronological characteristicsusing remote sensing datasets of recent missions, such as Oppenheimer, Atlas, Gassendi,Humboldt, Lavoisier, etc. In the case of Class-III FFCs, the Gassendi and Lavoisier craterswere investigated using datasets of recent lunar missions [18–22]. Other Class-III FFCsremain unexplored.Next, mineralogy furnishes clues for understanding the composition and evolutionof the lunar crust. In general, lunar surface mineralogy and lithologies are characterizedby/composed of four main minerals: plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, and ilmenite, and otherminor components/accessory minerals. The determination of lithological rock types couldbe performed based on the relative fractions of the abovementioned minerals. The lunarhighland materials/rocks are probably formed during the differentiation of a global lunarmagma ocean (LMO), when buoyant plagioclase accumulated to the upper crust to produceanorthositic rich materials due to its lesser density. Unlike highlands, the mare basalts arerich in ferrous and titanium. Furthermore, mare basalts are depleted in aluminum oxideAl2O3 [4,5,23,24]. In this context, the hyperspectral dataset, such as M3, plays a vital role indetermining minerals and rock types of the lunar surface due to absorption bands withinthe visible and near infrared region [25–29]. The absorption zones are related to electronicand vibrational processes within the crystal lattice of minerals [30,31].The plagioclase is the most abundant mineral present on the Moon and has an ab-sorption around 1250 nm wavelength [32]. It is a transparent mineral, having high albedoproperties. The slight mixture with other minerals is difficult to distinguish based on theinvestigation of the visible and near infrared region. Due to high-pressure events suchas impact cratering of more than ~10 and 30 GPa, the plagioclase absorption is weak-ened [33–35]. The plagioclase is the main component in the anorthositic highlands of theMoon [32,36]. Furthermore, the most common iron-bearing material on the lunar surface ispyroxene, which shows absorption bands around 1000 and 2000 nm [37]. The band centerposition of absorption bands moves to longer wavelengths with increasing contents ofFe+2 and/or Ca+2. The second most common iron-bearing mineral is olivine, which showsbroad absorption bands around the 1050 nm wavelength region [29,38].The class-III FFCs have characteristics such as a wide moat between the crater walland the interior, radial/polygonal fractures on the crater floor, and a terraced wall oppo-site the nearby mare region. Some prominent Class-III category FFCs include Gassendi,Taruntius, Lavoisier, Haldane and Runge [8]. The present study takes the Posidonius FFCfor detailed interpretation and mapping with recent lunar orbital datasets. The Posidoniuscrater belongs to the Class-III category of FFCs due to its wide moat of lava separating thecrater rim inner wall terraces from the fractured central floor. The fractures are polygonal,radial or concentric in structure. The aims and goals of the present research study include:(1) mapping and investigating the morphological characteristics and tectonic features ofthe Posidonius FCC using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera’s (LROC) Wide AngleCamera (WAC) images and LRO Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter’s (LOLA) Digital ElevationModel (DEM); (2) determining and characterizing the age of the Posidonius crater andits moat mare units using crater size frequency distribution (CSFD) using LRO datasets;(3) performing compositional and mineralogical analysis using Chandrayaan-1 Moon Min-Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 3 of 18eralogy Mapper (M3) data; and (4) searching for mineralogical evidence for the magmaticintrusion and (5) stratigraphical evolution of the study region.2. Study AreaPosidonius is a floor-fractured impact crater in the north-eastern part of the Serenitatisbasin main rim, with a latitude and longitude of 35◦20′0′′N, 27◦20′0′′E and 28◦0′0′′N,33◦30′0′′E, as shown in Figure 1. Analysis of the Apollo 17 felsic clast of breccia rocks andage dating concluded that the Serenitatis impact event occurred ~3.87 ± 0.04 Ga [39,40],which is near to the age (time period) of the Imbrium impact event (3.85 Ga). The Serenitatiscrater displays mass concentrations (Mascon) inside it and is filled with several series ofmagmatic activities [41–43]. Multi ring transition from complex craters occurs duringimpact events of more than 100 km [2]. The pre-impact morphology and present fracturesystem of the Posidonius crater is influenced by the Serenitatis impact. A wide moat isobserved between the floor and the inner wall, with sinuous rilles in the moat of lava.The Posidonius floor is vested with the fracturing of grabens and a central peak ring. Thesignificant and unique morphology of the study region led it to be chosen for detailedmorphological mapping using LRO datasets and mineralogical investigation using high-resolution hyperspectral datasets.Figure 1. Key map of the study area. (a) Near side of the Moon, Serenitatis basin rim is shown as ared circle and (b) LRO WAC subset for Posidonius floor-fractured lunar impact crater. The Posidoniuscrater is in the north-western portion of Serenitatis rim.3. Data Collection and Processing MethodologyIn the present study, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s (LRO) Lunar Reconnais-sance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Wide Angle Camera (WAC) was used for morphologicalmapping and interpretation. LROC WAC provides a spatial resolution of 100 m in 7 colorbands. LROC WAC mosaic data were used as a base map for morphological mapping andinterpretations [44].Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 4 of 18LRO’s Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) wasutilized for detailed topography analysis in the region. Highly accurate global coverage ofDEM points gives accurate DEM values and has become a reference geodetic frameworkfor the topographical analysis among the researchers of lunar communities with a spatialresolution of 118 m [45,46].The Chandrayaan-1 M3 is an imaging spectrometer/hyperspectral mapper that pro-vided the first high-resolution spatial and spectral data of most parts of the lunar surface.The primary science goal of M3 is to characterize and map lunar surface mineralogy in thecontext of lunar geologic evolution over a period of time [47,48]. M3 provides a spectralrange from 430 to 3000 nm, covering visible and near infrared data with 10 nm spectralsampling of 85 contiguous spectral bands. Two modes of spatial resolution are provided—one is a global mode with 140 m/pixel resolution and the other is a target mode with70 m/pixel resolution. Five optical periods of OP1A, OP1B, OP2A, OP2B, OP2C coveringdates from 18th November 2008 to 16th August 2009 were used. The data available from L0raw space crate data were improvised with calibrations, photometric correction, geometrycorrection, etc., as L1b data [26,47,48]. The following M3 strips were utilized in the presentstudy: M3G20090731T005012, M3G20090730T205153, and M3G20090730T163918.The morphological features of the Posidonius floor-fractured crater related to theimpact cratering process and volcanism are mapped in GIS environment using LRO WACimage and LOLA DEM. Fortezzo et al. published geological map shape files updatedand mapped morphological features inside the Posidonius crater and surrounding region.Many new morphological features, such as central peaks, the crater floor, wall, etc., notpresent in the Fortezzo et al. map were mapped in the present study [49]. The precisemapping and interpretation by visualization in the GIS environment is coupled withthe 3D module. The reconstruction of morphological characteristics of the real-worldstructures are constructed through scaled digital models. This constitutes an essentialstep in any geological and engineering environment, offering a good 3D perspective ofits characteristics to obtain a better understanding of the particular object of interest [50].Three-dimensional models provide a more objective, realistic and enhanced environmentfor geological analysis [51]. Three-dimensional geological modeling has become a powerfultool for understanding geological structures and is implemented in fields of geomorphicmapping and other fields of applied geology [52–56]. The topographic profiles weredrawn across the various morphological features using LOLA DEM, which helped us tocomprehend the surface variation differences and their connections. These topographicalprofiles have been extensively used to study the height of craters, sinuous rilles andfracture grabens.The lunar geological timescale has been divided into five distinct periods, namelypre-Nectarian (>3.92 Ga), Nectarian (3.92–3.84 Ga), Imbrian (Lower: 3.84–3.8; Upper:3.8–3.2), Eratosthenian (3.2–1.1 Ga) and Copernican (<1.1 Ga) [57]. The relative and absolutemodel ages of the homogenous units of the lunar surface were determined using theremote sensing-based crater size-frequency distributions (CSFD) method. This is a well-established and adequately applied method for the determination of the chronology oflunar surficial features [58–61]. In the present study, to determine the absolute model ageof the homogenous units, the CraterTools module was used for mapping craters [61]. Theobtained density, diameters and area of the craters was fed into the Craterstat2 statisticalsoftware and fitted with Neukum et al.’s (2001) production function for the determinationof absolute model ages of the homogeneous basaltic units [60].Precise 
mapping and quantitative evaluation of rock and minerals of planetary surfacescan be explored by optical remote sensing techniques. In particular, the hyperspectral dataof Ch 1- M3 are widely utilized for the precise mapping and discrimination of mineralmixtures. Hyperspectral datasets are processed using ENVI classic image analysis andprocessing software. A simple band ratio and RGB color composite images were generatedto find the lithological diversity and rock types of the Posidonius crater region. In orderto ascertain the maturity variation in the crater, the band ratio (950/750) was derived. InRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 5 of 18addition, the integrated band depth (IBD), and rock type color composite images were alsoderived to perceive the mineralogical diversity in the region.3.1. Integrated Band Depth (IBD) Analysis-Based Color CompositeTo find the lithological diversity and mafic mineralogy of the Posidonius crater region,a RGB color composite image was produced based on the integrated band depth (IBD)analysis. IBD is a powerful technique in mapping, differentiating and delineating mafic andfelsic minerals/rocks of the lunar surface [62]. Pyroxene and volcanic glasses materials withabsorptions around 1000 and 2000 nm can easily be distinguished from the surroundingterrain. The following parameters were used for IBD mapping:Red channel : IBD @ 1000 nm =26∑n=0(1− R(789 + 20n)RC(789 + 20n))(1)Green Channel : IBD @ 2000 nm =21∑n=0(1− R(1658 + 40n)RC(1658 + 40n))(2)Blue Channel := R1578 nm (3)where R is the reflectance at a particular wavelength and RC is the continuum-removedreflectance. Typically, the reflectance band at 1578.86 nm is free from absorptions of 1000and 2000 nm lunar minerals. Therefore, the RGB color composite was created along withintegrated bands of the 1000 and 2000 nm absorption zone [63–67].3.2. Rock Type Color CompositeIn order to differentiate different rock types of the lunar surface, band ratio basedRGB color composite images were generated to observe the prominent lunar minerals. Thepyroxene, spinel and anorthosite were delineated using the following formula:Red Channel: (R700 + R1200 nm)/2 × (R950 nm) (4)Green Channel: (R1400 nm/R1750 nm) (5)Blue Channel: (R1000 + R1500)/2 × (R1250) (6)where R is the reflectance at a particular wavelength.Red, green and blue channel exhibited the pyroxene ratio, spinel ratio and pureanorthosite (PAN) ratio, respectively [19,68].The reflectance spectra from the fresh materials of the central peak and the fresh craters(~1–2 km) were collected from Posidonius moat basaltic flow units. After the basaltic unitflows onto the surface of the Moon, it is exposed to the space weathering process, and henceit is unfair to obtain the spectra from weathered/matured basaltic units. Therefore, freshcraters are perfect lithological units for analyzing, interpreting, and characterizing the mareregion’s basaltic units [69–72]. The critical methodology was followed to select and collectthe immature reflectance spectra from fresh craters in order to avoid the unwanted shiftingof band center position due to the space weathering process and weak mafic diagnosticabsorption features [73–75]. Mostly homogenous single units or averaged 2by2 pixelplots depend upon the size of the crater. The reflectance spectra were carefully selectedbased on the immaturity, fresh and homogenous units without mixtures representing thebasaltic units. The optical immaturity trend-based methodology [76,77] was followed forthe analysis that was obtained by plotting the fresh craters’ spectral units, 950/750 nmvs. 750 nm. The continuum (i.e., the tie points) was initially found by maximizing theband area around the spectral minima between 750 and 1578 nm and 1578 and 3000 nm;if needed, the fit was manually adjusted. The band parameters were derived from thecollected fresh craters’ reflectance spectra after the continuum removal process. The threecritical band parameters derived from continuum-removed reflectance spectra are theRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 6 of 18band center, band depth, and band area of 1000 and 2000 nm absorptions [78–81]. Theband center is a minimum position of wavelength in third to fourth order of polynomialfit. Iterations were performed after continuum removal of 1000 and 2000 nm absorptionsseparately, and polynomial fits were identified. The band depth was one minus the valueof the third/fourth order polynomial fit at the band center. The band area was derived bythe sum of the area underneath each continuum segment, which was calculated as oneminus the value of a particular channel multiplied by its spectra resolution, respectively.Finally, the band area ratio was calculated by dividing the band area of 2000 nm by theband area of 1000 nm absorption. Furthermore, these derived parameters were comparedwith synthetic laboratory-prepared ortho- and clinopyroxenes [28,80].4. Results and Discussion4.1. Morphological Mapping and Tectonics of Posidonius Crater4.1.1. Morphology of Posidonius CraterThe Posidonius crater is a complex impact structure 112 km in diameter. The craterhas been modified after formation due to the intrusion of a sill, and the floor has beenuplifted and fractured. A moat was observed, and the Posidonius crater was classifiedunder Class-III FCC. The elevation profile, generated in the east–west and north–southdirections impeccably, depicts the morphological features of the Posidonius crater. Theeast–west profile (A-A′, Figure 2) indicates that the left side is rimless due to destructionrelated to volcanic activity. A simple crater 11 km in diameter is present on its floor, withlinear and/or radial fractured floors and an elevated rim on the western side. Meanwhile,the north–south profile indicates the elevated rims perfectly, the presence of a moat onthe western edge, a dome-shaped central peak/mount, and a terraced inner wall followedby an elevated rim (B-B′, Figure 2). The elevation profile drawn across the sinuous rilleindicates that it is ~90 m deep and 2000 m wide (C-C′, Figure 2). The elevation profiledrawn across graben indicates that it is ~50 m deep and 1000 m wide. The morphologicalfeatures were mapped in the study region and geological units were named as follows:highland material, terra units, plains, mare units, volcanic channels, crater materials, thecentral peak ring, the crater floor and the crater wall (Figure 3a). Crater materials arerelated to impact-related materials, including small and fresh craters (above 3 km).Central Peak Ring and Crater FloorThe Posidonius central portion is recognized as having a central peak in ring form.The single central peak or more peaks as a ring structure were formed due to their elasticrebounding nature during the modification stage. The central peaks are composed ofmaterials from the deeper portions [1–3,82]. The Posidonius crater has a central peakring, a fractured floor and wall slumps/terraces. Four distinct mounts of central peakswere observed, and the central peak ring is covered by hummocky floor material. Thecentral peak ring is a common feature present on the surface of the moon for largercomplex craters [83,84]. The four discontinuous central peak ring massifs are observedwith heights ranging from 300 to 500 m. The crater floor is observed to be hummockyand fractured.Crater Moat and Other Mare UnitsThe mare unit appears to be dark in optical remote sensing images and enriched inmafic minerals, i.e., pyroxene [23]. According to the present study region, the mare unitsare related to two basaltic units—one from Serenitatis and another within the Posidoniuscrater moat. A long volcanic channel more than ~180 km in length is present within themoat mare basaltic unit. The volcanic channel is sinuous in nature and splits the mareunits in two.Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 7 of 18Crater Wall and Ejecta BlanketThe crater walls are elongated on three sides other than west. The crater walls areslumped and terraced, which is observed in the eastern part, whereas the western innerwall is covered by mare basalt of the moat.Highland and Its Related MaterialsHighland materials present in the study region are remnants of preimpact Posidoniusimpact materials, which are poor in mafic materials and appear bright in optical images.Terra units are unevenly covered with materials and rocks of an older age and typicallyconsist of plagioclase-enriched anorthositic materials. Plains are landforms of the highlandregion and are mostly smooth in appearance [42].4.1.2. Tectonics of Posidonius CraterThe Posidonius FCC is present on the rim of the Serenitatis impact basin. Grabens arelinear landforms with adown dropped block in the center associated with adjacent blocksdue to faults. Normal faults are planar surface discontinuities due to extensional stressexpressed as fractional sliding found across the lunar surface [4,85–88]. The FCC nature of thePosidonius is related to the formation of sills rather than extrusion/ viscous relaxation. Thelithospheric loading by adjacent volcanic load (Serenitatis basin) generates a stress state and thedistribution of fracture system favors the rim location [89–91]. The linear and tectonic featureswere mapped separately to better understand the surficial process, i.e., radial/elongatedfractures, grabens, volcanic channel/sinuous rilles and impact-related circular features.Figure 2. (a) LRO WAC-generated 3D image for detailed topographic analysis; (b) LOLA DEMshowing the elevation value of Posidonius crater region; (c–f) topographical profile drawn across thevarious morphological and tectonic structures.Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 8 of 18Figure 3. (a) Morphological map of the study area, modified after Fortezzo et al. 2020; (b) tectonicand linear features map of the Posidonius crater region using LRO LROC WAC and DEM data.Radial/Elongated FracturesThe radial/elongated fractures were present adjacent to the crater floor or near thefloor boundary. Three such radial/elongated fractures were observed within the Posidoniuscrater region.GrabensLithospheric loading by adjacent volcanic load (Serenitatis basin) generates a stressfracture, and the true grabens are formed as a result of brittle failure due to the irreversibleand rapid propagation of magma and connection of cracks [92]. They are often calledfissures, which shows their association with the volcanic process, and they act as thesignificant features for the generation of fluid migration to reach the surface [93–95]. Fivefractures/true grabens were observed within the floor of the Posidonius crater, with lengthranges from 43 to 59 m.Posidonius, Serenitatis and Other Impact Crater RimsThe crater rim is considered a concentric fracture in the tectonic context. These featuresare also mapped in this study. The Serenitatis rim is drawn by connecting the rim to otherthan the Posidonius region and the present fracture system also follows it, indicating thatthe old rim fracture is reactivated by the new ones.Central Peak Ring and Sinuous Rille/Volcanic ChannelThe transition from the complex craters to peak-ring craters/basins involves the initialdestruction and widening of the massive central peak [96]. The down and outward collapseRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 9 of 18of an unstable central massif uplift leads to the formation of a discontinuous central peakring [97]. These regions have low density and low seismic velocity and extend to a certaindepth beneath the surface [98,99]. A long sinuous rille of the volcanic channel is perceivedin the Posidonius moat. It is named Rima Posidonius, and is 212 km in length, 0.77 km inwidth, and 96.13 m in depth, with a slope of 0.02 and sinuosity of 1.50 [100]. The sinuousrille formation mechanism is related to lava flow channels with levees of mechanical and/orthermal erosion [101–103].4.2. Chronology and Stratigraphy of Posidonius Crater RegionThe Serenitatis impact event was a large impact event that occurred during the periodof lunar heavy bombardment (LHB). Analysis of the Apollo 17 felsic clast of breccia rocksand age dating concluded that this impact event occurred at 3.87 ± 0.04 Ga [39]. TheSerenitatis basin displays mass concentrations (Mascon) inside it and is filled with severalseries of magmatic activities [40–43]. In the present study, the CSFD-based crater age isdetermined for the Posidonius crater floor and two mare flow units. The Posidonius craterfloor shows an age of 3.72 Ga. The Posidonius crater moat mare units show ages of 3.5and 3.34 Ga (Figure 4). According to a new and updated lunar impact crater database byLosiak et al. (2009), the Posidonius crater belong to the upper Imbrian period [104,105],which is consistent with our results regarding the age estimation of the Posidonius crater.Figure 4. (a) LRO WAC subset for the Posidonius floor-fractured lunar impact crater. The crater sizefrequency distribution (CSFD)-based ages of (b) Posidonius crater floor and (c,d) Posidonius cratermoat mare units.The formation of larger graben systems on the near side of the moon stopped around3.6 ± 0.2 Ga. In contrast, the formation of small-scale grabens continued up to 1.2 Ga [106,107].French et al. identified that small scale grabens found in the Posidonius moat mare regionsand not superimposed by craters are of a relatively younger age. These Posidonius moatsmare small-scale graben crosscut, partially degraded craters ranging in diameter from80 to 200 in meters. So, these small-scale grabens have a maximum age between the lateRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 10 of 18Eratosthenian and early Copernican period of the lunar stratigraphical timescale [11,108,109].In addition, the grabens not associated with contraction features were used to estimatemare thickness, which was found to be 190 m for Posidonius moat mare units [109]. Thepresence of small-scale grabens ranging from 0.5 to 2 km in width and up to 50 km in lengthis linked to the outcomes of intrusive volcanism [7,107,109].4.3. Mineralogical Diversity Mapping and Reflectance Spectra Analysis of Posidonius CraterThe mineralogical diversity of the Posidonius crater region was explored using M3mosaic data. The reflectance band at 1578 nm is free from the absorption of mafic minerals,and it could be considered as an albedo image of the region (Figure 5a). A band ratio of950/750 nm is generated to depict the comparative stratigraphy of geological units andis color coded with red to blue (small to high). The fresh craters appear red in tone andhave lower values (1), as shown in Figure 5b. The northern side peak-ring massifs alsoappear red in tone, indicating the presence of younger materials (2). The mare units relatedto Serenitatis and the Posidonius moat appear intermediate blue in color (3). The ejectablanket of Posidonius crater exhibits higher values and indicates older materials (4).Figure 5. (a) Albedo image of M3 reflectance band at 1578 nm; (b) simple band ratio of 950/750 nm,fresh and young surfaces exhibit lower value; (c) integrated band depth analysis-based color compos-ite image; (d) rock type color composite of the Posidonius crater region.Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 11 of 18In order to map the mineralogical/lithological diversity of the Posidonius crater region,two RGB-based color composite images were generated using IBD analysis and rock typecolor composite. The IBD-based color composite is shown in Figure 5c. The presence ofblue color indicates plagioclase-enriched anorthositic highland materials and a low contentof mafic minerals. The Posidonius floor (5), rim (6) and ejecta blanket (7) appear bluein the IBD-based color composite image. The mare units appear green to pale yellow incolor (8). The fresh craters appear yellow in color, indicating the presence of pyroxene.Pyroxene will have absorption around 1000 and 2000 nm [29,36,37]. The fresh craters in theSerenitatis mare units, Posidonius moat mare and north-eastern mare units appear brightyellow in color (9). The one among the massifs of the central peak ring also appears brightyellow to white in color, indicating the presence of low calcium pyroxene and could becategorized as noritic in nature (10), as shown in Figure 4c. This specifies that the intrusionprocess has taken place in one massif of the Posidonius crater peak ring structures. Thecentral peaks are preferential and favorable sites for intrusions to reach the surface fromthe sub-
surface [16].The rock type color composite is generated and shown in Figure 4d. The Posidoniusejecta blanket (11), floor (12) appears blue in color, indicating anorthositic-rich materials.Mare units related to Serenitatis (13), the Posidonius moat (14) and others (15) appear in ared tone, which indicates that they are mafic in nature. The fresh craters in various marebasalts units appear bright yellow, which strongly indicates the presence of pyroxene (16).The one among the five central peak massifs vested in the northern central region alsoappears bright yellow in color (17, Figure 5d). The absence of green color indicates thisfloor-fractured crater is lacking spinel-bearing minerals.Furthermore, the color composite image is validated by collecting spectra from variouslithological units of the Posidonius FFC region (Figure 6). The rock type color compositeis taken into account for the validation of reflectance spectra and compared with RELABdata for the better interpretation and naming of minerals [110]. The matured Posidoniusmoat mare unit reflectance spectra show minor absorption at 990 and 2100 nm and indicatemafic bearing minerologies (1). The bright yellow fresh crater from the mare basalts ofthe north-eastern part of the Posidonius FFC shows strong 990 and 2150 nm absorptionand indicates clinopyroxene augite (2). One among the central peak massifs shows abright yellow color tone and exhibits strong absorption around 990 and 1900 nm, whichindicates that it is noritic in composition (3). The presence of low calcium-bearing noriticlithological units agrees with and confirms the intrusion process. The yellow appearance ofone of the fresh craters in the Posidonius moat mare collected reflectance spectra showsstrong absorption at 1000 and 2100 nm and indicates high calcium pyroxene levels (4). ThePosiodnius FCC ejecta blanket appears in shades of blue in the rock type color compositeimage and indicates plagioclase-rich anorthositic highland materials. The two reflectancespectra were collected from these units: one is from a bright fresh crater and other froma matured crater with a pale blue tone (5 and 6, Figure 6). Both craters show no maficabsorption and featureless spectra. The fresh crater collected reflectance spectra have abright tone, demonstrating that Posidonius ejecta possess an overall high reflectance value.These featureless spectra are related to the presence of plagioclase [35,36].In addition, the reflectance spectra were collected, and band parameters were derivedfor finding the pyroxene chemistry of the Posidonius FCC mafic units. The reflectancespectra were collected from the noritic massif of the central peak ring and fresh craters ofthe Posidonius moat mare unit by utilizing M3 data of Chandrayaan-1. The absorptionband depths at 1000 and 2000 nm were investigated by deriving the band parameterssuch as band center, band depth and band area (Table 1). The locations of reflectancespectra collected from the Posidonius FCC region are shown in Figure 7. The noriticmassif of the central peak ring shows strong absorption in 926.33 and 1925.67 nm. Thefresh crater’s reflectance spectra from the Posidonius moat mare units demonstrate thatthe 1000 nm absorption band center range from 949.65 to 1049.85 nm, and the 2000 nmabsorption band center ranges from 2074.67 to 2201.25 nm. The band parameters suchRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 12 of 18as the band center, band depth and band area are derived using 1000 and 2000 nm maficabsorption from the analysis of hyperspectral data based on Gaffey et al. 2002 [111]. Thederived band center and shape parameters allow us to estimate endmember mineralogyand their composition [84,112]. The noritic massif of the central peak exhibits absorptionof around 930 and 1900 nm and confirms the plutonic intrusion of low-calcium pyroxene.The reflectance spectra from the fresh craters of the Posidonius crater moat mare unitexhibit absorption around 950 to 1000 nm and 2000 to 2200 nm. These are calcium-richmineralogical units, and they contain clinopyroxene pigeonite.Figure 6.

The dikeintrusion is a potential cause for the grabens in the crater floor and low-density brecciazones [17,113]. The breccia lenses beneath them extend to a few tens of kilometers. Thecentral peak or rings of peaks are favorable for mafic pluton intrusion/alteration globallyon the lunar surface [114,115]. The intrusive mafic plutonic geological activity plays a vitalrole in shaping the Poisonous FCC’s present morphology and mineralogy.The morphological and mineralogical characteristics of the Posidonius crater werecompared with those of other similar class-III FCCs. The Gassendi crater is 110 km wideand vested in the western near side of the Moon around the north of Mare Humorum. Thecentral peak exhibits anorthositic-rich units, and olivine is found in one site. The Gassendifloor and fractures are gabbroic in composition, enriched in high-calcium pyroxene alongwith ferrous and titanium enrichment. Igneous intrusion shaped the present state of theGassendi crater after the impact cratering process. The mare units within the Gassendicrater are rich in calcium pyroxene, and band parameters analysis indicates that they varyfrom a sub-calcic to calcic composition. The CSFD-based age estimation of mare unitsshows that they were formed 3.59 to 2.99 Ga ago [20,21]. The Posidonius FCC also possessessimilar and consistent results in size, morphology, fracture system and igneous intrusion.In the case of the Lavoisier FCC, it is 70 km in diameter and vested at the western edgeof the Oceanus Procellarum. The pyroclastic deposits are found on the floor adjacent tograbens [22]. It differs from the Posidonius FCC’s morphology and minerology.5. ConclusionsIn the present study, the LROC WAC image and DEM data have been utilized for map-ping the morphological and tectonic features in the Posidonius FCC. The CSFD-based ageswere estimated for homogenous units. The Chandrayaan-1 M3 data have been extensivelyRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 814 14 of 18used for the generation of color composite images, the band ratio and the characterizationof reflectance spectra in the visible and near infrared region effectively to delineate thevarious lithology/mineralogical units. The study highlights the following outcomes:Remote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 20   ✓ Mapping of linear and tectonic characterization has been obtained to ascertain the surficial process of the crater with different units, such as grabens, radial/elongated fractures, volcanic channels/sinuous rilles and impact-related circular features, and the respective unit ranges were observed. ✓ The crater size frequency distribution (CSFD)-based age dating shows the Posidonius crater is 3.72 Ga old and belongs to upper Imbrian period. The moat mare units show ages of 3.5 and 3.34 Ga.  ✓ From the overall observations, it is observed that the Posidonius floor-fractured com-plex crater (diameter of 112km) comes under the type-III FFC, which is vested with a central peak ring and moat. Moreover, the mineralogically evident intrusion of a sill and dike favors the conditions for the fracture system. Eventually, it is shown that the origin and evolution of the crater occurred due to stress and strain, which were gen-erated due to adjacent intrusive mafic plutonic lithospheric loading from the Sereni-tatis basin’s formation.

T e m at mare units show ages of 3.5 and 3.34 Ga.  ✓ From th  o erall observati s, it is observed that he Posidonius floor-fractured com-plex cr ter (diameter  112km) comes un er the type-III FF , which is ve ted with a central peak ring and moat. Moreover, the m n ral gically evide t intrusion of  sill and dike favors the conditions for the fracture system. Eventually, it is shown that the origin and evolution of the cr ter occurred due to stress and strain, which were gen-erated du  to adjacen in rusive mafic plutonic lith spheric loa ing fr m the S reni-tatis basin’s formation.
