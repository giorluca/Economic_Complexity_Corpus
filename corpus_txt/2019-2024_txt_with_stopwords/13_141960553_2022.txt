The evolution of the leaf economics spectrum (LES) is known to be constrained by genetic relatedness but also promoted at small geographical and phylogenetic scales. In those cases, we hypothesized that polyploidy would play a prominent role as an outstanding source of functional divergence and adaptive potential.2. We registered leaf- level nutrient, water- and light- economy- related traits from the LES as well as edaphic properties in the four cytotypes of the autopolyploid Dianthus broteri complex (2×, 4×, 6× and 12×). We analysed the effect of ploidy level on the integration of the LES network, checked if concerted evolution oc-curred between LES and soil niche and tested the influence of phylogeny on the variables. Alternative evolutionary models for both sets of traits were compared.3. We found higher divergence of polyploids (especially 6× and 12×) compared to diploids in the LES and soil niche, but these traits are not coevolving. 6× and 12× showed opposite ecological strategies regarding resource use and higher uncoupling of the LES network. Early divergence of traits prevailed in both LES and edaphic niche (supported by better fitted evolutionary models with one op-timum per cytotype), but post- polyploidization processes played an important role for the photochemical behaviour.4. Synthesis. Our results indicated shifts in ecological strategies across Dianthus broteri cytotypes and suggested a powerful role of polyploidy in overcoming constraints for the evolution of plant functional traits.K E Y W O R D Sadaptive divergence, ecological strategies, functional traits, leaf economics spectrum, polyploidy, soil niche1  |  INTRODUC TIONPlant functional traits are those impacting their demographic fit-ness, that is, fecundity, growth, development or survival (Violle et al., 2007; Volaire et al., 2020). Notably, major functional traits in vascular plants are concentrated and coordinated in a multidimen-sional space explaining plant form and function at a global scale (Díaz et al., 2016). Within the global plant trait variation, there is a fully dif-ferentiated axis corresponding to the leaf economics spectrum (LES; Wright et al., 2004), which accounts for the return on investments in 606  |   Journal of Ecology LÓPEZ- JURADO Et AL.leaves regarding carbon and nutrient acquisition and processing. The coordination among LES traits, especially on a mass basis, causes this spectrum to be defined by a trade- off between plant longevity and growth potential (Wright et al., 2004). According to this, eco-logical strategies would be reflected by the positioning of a given plant species along the LES (Reich, 2014), varying from nutrient- acquisitive strategies, also known as fast (with high photosynthetic capacity and short- lived leaves), to conservative ones (i.e. slow, with low photosynthetic capacity and long- lived leaves).Beyond nutrient- associated traits, this spectrum seems to be coordinated with the essential resources of water and light (Reich, 2014). Previous studies have already demonstrated the correlation between plant nutrient and water economy (e.g. Pérez- Ramos et al., 2012; Prieto et al., 2018), being the species with slow strategies also conservative about water and therefore more toler-ant to drought (Hallik et al., 2009). Furthermore, the coordination of light economy with the purely LES traits has also been indirectly addressed by linking shade tolerance with less thick and dense leaf blades, probably to achieve larger harvesting surfaces in light- limited environments (e.g. Hallik et al., 2009; Lusk et al., 2008). On the basis of these findings and the results obtained by Hallik et al. (2012) about chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics in woody and her-baceous species under different growth irradiance conditions, we hypothesized that light collection at the photosystem level would be enhanced for less light- exposed leaves while PSII photochemical efficiency would be diminished as a result of photoinhibition. In any case, the joint study of variables related to nutrient, water and light use are needed to delve into the interdependence of functional traits that assure plant success in a given environment, following the re-spective recommendations of Poorter et al. (2014) and Reich (2014).However, global- scale trait covariation in the LES is challenged by non- global scale predictions (Mason et al., 2016). Locally, natural selection can generate trait correlations that are relatively easy to escape (soft constraint) by drivers of phenotypic variation, altering the LES trade- off. These drivers include plasticity, ecological filter-ing, sexual reproduction, adaptation, genetic drift or ontogenetic mechanisms (Messier et al., 2017) and may lead to a diversity of functional trait associations within phylogenetically closely related groups (Carvalho et al., 2020; Niinemets, 2015) and even at the intra- individual level (between leaf cohorts; Puglielli, 2019; Puglielli & Varone, 2018). Noticeably, a significant relationship occurs be-tween environmental conditions and LES traits, as the influence of soil properties (Lambers & Poorter, 1992; Lambers et al., 2008), but also the interaction between soil and climate (Luo et al., 2015, 2016) has been addressed on plant functional traits and resource- use strategies. This supports the interpretation of trait– environment associations as a result of adaptive evolution (Reich et al., 2003), highlighting the role of resource availability or climatic conditions in functional divergence along the LES (Brouillette et al., 2014; Sartori et al., 2019).Apart from natural selection, harder constraints (i.e. those that are almost impossible to escape) to novel trait associations shape the expression of the LES. These are of biophysical and genetic nature (Messier et al., 2017), being the former the most restrictive ones and consistent within and across ecological scales. Among bio-physical constraints, the link between photosynthetic capacity and leaf life span is of paramount importance since there are unavoidable limitations to construct long- lasting leaves with high productivity. Furthermore, the evolution of the LES is expected to be limited to some extent by a genetic component, although this topic deserves further investigation (Donovan et al., 2011). Specifically, the refer-enced study suggested that both selection and genetic constraints need to be measured jointly to test their relative roles on the LES evolution. To date, it is known that a few pleiotropic genes maintain the strong correlations between LES traits (Vasseur et al., 2012), which would have a major role in the phenotypic integration within this complex network (Ji et al., 2020).In the light of this evidence, the release of genetic constraints would be the baseline for promoting functional divergence in the LES. It would cause evolutionary novelties such as adaptive pheno-typic plasticity or epigenetic variation (Kalisz & Kramer, 2008). Thus, polyploidy (i.e. the state of having more than two paired sets of chro-mosomes) may play a pivotal role on LES evolution over low phyloge-netic scales given that it is considered an outstanding driver of these sources of adaptive modifications (Chen, 2007; Hahn et al., 2012). Allopolyploids (those originated from interspecific hybridization) are prone to produce numerous combinations of traits due to their di-verse origin (Seehausen, 2004), but genome duplication itself and subsequent adaptation have also demonstrated the capacity to cause phenotypic changes in autopolyploids (those originated from a single species; Martínez et al., 2018; Visger et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2020). Moreover, autopolyploidy per se can lead to novelty by modifying the phenotypic covariance matrix, meaning the disintegration or un-coupling of those traits (Oswald & Nuismer, 2011). This evolutionary innovation in polyploids can be caused either by relaxed selection on duplicate genes due to their higher functional redundancy (Flagel & Wendel, 2009) or increased variation in dosage- regulated gene ex-pression levels (Osborn et al., 2003).Using a recently radiated autopolyploid complex, we can not only assess the effect of polyploidization and rapid adaptive pro-cesses on functional divergence, but we also would provide new insights into the neglected ecological context of non- crop poly-ploid systems (Soltis et al., 2016). An approach like the one used in this work would facilitate underlying explanations to several widely studied ecological processes in polyploids, such as compet-itive interactions (see e.g. Čertner et al., 2019), fitness advantage (see e.g. Wei et al., 2019) or niche differentiation (see e.g. Rojas- Andrés et al., 2020).Considering this background, we studied LES variation across the autopolyploid complex Dianthus broteri (Caryophyllaceae). This group of perennial herbaceous plants consists of four different ploidy levels (2×, 4×, 6× and 12×; Balao et al., 2009) that diverged about 0.9– 2.1 Mya (Balao et al., 2010) and have different evolution-ary histories (the 4× cytotype has two independent origins while 6× and 12× have single origins; Balao et al., 2010). Moreover, D. broteri has a Mediterranean distribution (exclusively in the Iberian     |  607Journal of EcologyLÓPEZ- JURADO Et AL.Peninsula), where its ploidies do not coexist and occupy disjunct geographical ranges with markedly different environmental con-ditions. Comparatively, diploids and tetraploids inhabit temperate and broad niches with nutrient- rich soils, whereas hexaploids and dodecaploids are distributed in warm and arid habitats with infertile soils (López- Jurado et al., 2019). The inter- cytotype differentiation pattern in this complex also encompasses global methylation levels (Alonso et al., 2016) and photochemical responses (López- Jurado et al., 2020). Interestingly, morphological features (vegetative and reproductive organs) not only showed divergence among D. broteri cytotypes, but also a loss of phenotypic integration with increas-ing ploidy (i.e. lower covariation among functionally related traits; Balao et al., 2011). The shared conclusions from the mentioned stud-ies suggest adaptations of polyploids (particularly 6× and 12×) to specific biotic and abiotic factors. Besides that, a focus on the 12× has been established caused by unique properties as its floral scent emission (Balao et al., 2011), high tolerance to recurrent drought (López- Jurado et al., 2016) and alleged key role in ecosystem func-tioning (López- Jurado et al., 2019).Based on the mentioned previous results obtained for this complex, our starting hypotheses were that (a) D. broteri has a variety of LES trait combinations and hence ecological strate-gies, which would be acquisitive in low- order ploidy levels (2× and 4×) and conservative in high- order ones (6× and 12×; in re-sponse to the stressful niches that they inhabit) and (b) polyploidy is enhancing the uncoupling of functional traits in this complex, especially in the 6× and 12× cytotypes. In this study, we aimed to uncover polyploidy- mediated shifts in the LES and the edaphic niche, as well as resource (nutrient, water and light) acquisition and resource- use strategies that enable the D. broteri polyploid complex to occupy heterogeneous environments.2  |  MATERIAL S AND METHODS2.1  |  Characterization of study sitesDuring July 2017, three natural populations of each Dianthus broteri cytotype encompassing their corresponding geographical distribu-tions were sampled (between 10:00 and 14:00 hr; Figure S1). All these locations were characterized by considerably low D. broteri density, ranging between 30 and 100 individuals, which were ac-companied mostly by xerophytic Mediterranean shrubland. In each location, the main climatic conditions were recorded (Table S1), be-sides performing measurement and sampling procedures described in the following sections.As previously shown in López- Jurado et al. (2019), populations of lower cytotypes (2× and 4×) had milder climatic conditions com-pared to those of higher ones (6× and 12×), and showed interme-diate values in relative humidity and the lowest temperatures. On average, the niche of hexaploids was the most humid during sam-pling time (summer) and dodecaploids were exposed to the warmest and driest conditions (Table S1).2.2  |  Soil composition and propertiesIn each population, soil samples (n = 3) from the upper 15 cm were collected throughout the area occupied by D. broteri individu-als, placed in plastic containers and conserved at 4°C until their processing in the laboratory. Soil granulometric composition was determined and chemical characterization considered, for exam-ple, soil electrical conductivity (EC), which is an indirect indica-tor of the amount of water and water- soluble nutrients available for plant uptake (Smith & Doran, 1997). Organic matter content (OM; by the Walkley– Black method), total carbonates (CaCO3), ac-tive limestone and nitrogen (N, by the Kjeldahl method) were also included in the analysis. Finally, we quantified assimilable phos-phorus (P) by ultraviolet– visible spectrophotometry, as well as ex-changeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Fernandez- Hernandez et al., 2010; Usman et al., 2017).2.3  |  Leaf nutrient concentrations and isotopic compositionCompletely developed mature distal leaves (n = 5 per individual, n = 50 per population) were collected from the middle canopy layer of plants. Leaves from the same population were blended, dried at 60°C for 48 hr and finely ground using a mixer mill (Retsch GmbH— MM 301). Carbon and nitrogen contents of each leaf pool replicate (n = 3 per population) were quantified using a LECO TruSpec CN elemental analyzer. Additionally, Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP- OES) analy-sis was carried out in a Thermo Scientific iCAP 6500 spectrometer to determine levels of macro- and micro- nutrients in leaf pools (n = 3 per population; Table S3). Among the numerous leaf nutri-ents, we focused on N, P and K levels because of their tight as-sociation with plant productivity (Niinemets & Kull, 2005; Sardans & Peñuelas, 2015). N and P influence photosynthesis by having structural and functional roles in the Calvin cycle and the thyla-koids (Evans, 1989; Vance et al., 2003) and K is involved in a broad range of plant physiological functions (e.g. enzyme activation and regulation of osmotic potential or stomatal opening; Wang et al., 2013).The calculation of C and N isotopic signature on dry and pul-verized leaf samples (n = 3 per population) was conducted using a Thermo Scientific Delta V spectrometer. The carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) were expressed in delta (δ) no-tation, defined as the parts per thousand (‰) relative to a standard material (VPDB). The analytical precision for the measurements was 0.2‰. δ15N 
was used as a proxy for nitrogen fluxes, assimilation and allocation (Kalcsits et al., 2014) supplementary to leaf N content. Furthermore, water- use strategies were approached by δ13C, which was employed as a proxy for iWUE (intrinsic water- use efficiency; Pérez- Harguindeguy et al., 2013) because it relies on the ratio of 608  |   Journal of Ecology LÓPEZ- JURADO Et AL.intercellular to ambient CO2 concentrations (Ci/Ca) and therefore is affected by transpiration at the stomata (gs) and net assimilation (AN; Farquhar et al., 1989).2.4  |  Leaf traits and physiological measurementsDuring field sampling, we collected 10 completely developed ma-ture leaves in each population (1 leaf per individual) and meas-ured their areas in the field by digital image analysis using ‘Easy Leaf Area’ software (Easlon & Bloom, 2014). Dry weight (DW) was determined after drying the leaves at 60°C until constant weight was reached and leaf mass per area (LMA) was then calculated as the ratio between DW and leaf area (g DW/m2). LMA was se-lected as a crucial variable to account for leaf constructions costs as well as plant growth rate (low LMA indicates thin leaf blade or not very dense tissue, or both, which contribute to short leaf life spans and fast growth rates; Lambers & Poorter, 1992; Westoby et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2004), also being highly variable within functional groups and responsive to environmental conditions (Poorter et al., 2009).Furthermore, the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photo-chemistry (Fv/Fm) and the chlorophyll a fast kinetics were registered in 30 min dark- adapted, completely developed leaves (n = 25 per pro-tocol) from randomly selected individuals of each population, using FMS- 2 (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., UK) and FluorPen FP100 (Photo System Instruments, Czech Republic) portable pulse- modulated flu-orimeters, respectively. For the chlorophyll a transient data, we used the pre- programmed OJIP test protocols of FluorPen FP100 and cal-culated derived parameters following Strasser et al. (2010). In par-ticular, we analysed the informative energy transduction fluxes on a leaf cross- section basis (absorbed, ABS/CS, trapped, TR/CS, elec-tron transport, ET/CS, and dissipated, DI/CS, energy fluxes) since significant differences in the density of reaction centres (RC/CS) among cytotypes were previously found (one- way analysis of vari-ance, ANOVA: F3,246 = 5.91; p < 0.05). Fv/Fm and OJIP test- derived total performance index (PITotal) were considered based on the broad view they offer about the overall photochemical activity and their sensitivity to stressful conditions, as those of the sampling time in summer.2.5  |  Edaphic divergence of polyploidsAfter obtaining a detailed description of the edaphic niche char-acteristics in the 12 sampled D. broteri populations, we estimated their phylogenetic relationships from a previously performed phylo-gram based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data (see Balao et al., 2010, 2011). Polytomies were resolved in random order using the multi2di function from the ‘ape’ package in r (Paradis et al., 2004). Using the ‘adephylo’ r package (Jombart, Balloux, et al., 2010), we then performed a phylogenetic principal component analysis (pPCA; Jombart, Pavoine, et al., 2010), which can detect sets of soil traits presenting a similar phylogenetic signal and hence informs about the general influence of phylogeny on the measured variables. Through this method, we attempted to identify sources of inter- cytotype variation due to phylogenetic relatedness as well as local divergence (i.e. adaptation or phenotypic plasticity). On the one hand, axes with the most positive eigenvalues reflected positive phylogenetic autocorrelation, corresponding to early diverged traits (global structures sensu Jombart, Pavoine, et al., 2010). At the micro-evolutionary scale studied in the D. broteri complex, early divergence is tightly related to polyploid formation (Balao et al., 2010), although it is not completely possible to separate direct effects due to poly-ploidization from rapid selection promoting the polyploid establish-ment without experimenting with synthetic polyploids. On the other hand, axes with the most negative eigenvalues mirrored the most recently diverged traits (lower phylogenetic autocorrelation than null expected or local structures), related to post- polyploidization processes such as adaptation and phenotypic plasticity.2.6  |  Divergence and integration in the LES covariation networkFor the analyses involving LES and its relationship with polyploidy, we used the previously introduced meaningful variables to describe ecological strategies from nutrient (LMA, leaf N, P, K and δ15N) to water use (δ13C), but also the photochemical behaviour (ABS/CS, TR/CS, ET/CS, DI/CS, Fv/Fm and PITotal). Thus, we carried out a pPCA, as previously described, using the 12 selected functional variables to investigate the effects of phylogeny and downstream selection on the LES. The influence of ploidy level on both sets of variables (functional and edaphic) was analysed using one- way ANOVAs in the two most explanatory axes from each pPCA. In case of significant results, post- hoc Tukey's HSD tests (α = 0.05) were performed to identify inter- cytotype pairwise differences.The overall covariation network in LES traits considering the influence of phylogeny was analysed using the ‘corrr’ package in r (Kuhn et al., 2020). We also quantified the magnitude of integration in the LES network, as a measure of coordination between functional traits, for each D. broteri cytotype separately based on the index of phenotypic integration (INT; Cheverud et al., 1989; Wagner, 1984), following the approach of Damián et al. (2020). We first constructed one correlation matrix per cytotype using Pearson's r and compared them by Mantel tests. We calculated INT values by accounting for the variance among eigenvalues (λi) of each correlation matrix and then corrected the values as INTc = (Var (λi) − (number of traits − 1)/number of individuals per cytotype). We transformed each INTc to percentage of the maximum integration, which equals the total number of traits in the correlation matrix. Finally, we obtained the 95% confidence intervals for each INTc by the bootstrapping method (R = 10,000). High INTc values were indicative of high vari-ance among eigenvalues and therefore strong phenotypic integra-tion (i.e. high trait coordination), whereas low INTc values meant that phenotypic integration was weak in a particular cytotype (i.e. low     |  609Journal of EcologyLÓPEZ- JURADO Et AL.trait coordination). Less overlapping confidence intervals among cytotypes were considered as evidence of variation in phenotypic integration.2.7  |  LES and edaphic niche evolution: Divergence in nutrient uptake and use efficiencyComplementary to both pPCAs (i.e. soil and LES), we tested for phy-logenetic signal on the most explanatory axes with global structures using the Blomberg's K (Blomberg et al., 2003) in the ‘phytools’ r package (Revell, 2012). Given the cytotype relatedness pattern, the global structures can be interpreted as a consequence of niche/func-tional conservatism (following a Brownian motion model of grad-ual drift; BM) or divergence due to polyploidization (following an Ornstein– Uhlenbeck, OU, model of stabilizing selection with differ-ent optima; Butler & King, 2004). To investigate these alternatives, we compared the relative fit of several evolutionary models in case of significant phylogenetic signal: BM as well as an OU model with a single optimum (OU1) and an OU model with four optima (corre-sponding to one optimum per ploidy; OU4). Models were performed with the ‘mvMORPH’ r package (Clavel et al., 2015) and compared by the weights of their Akaike information criterion values (AIC). In case of pPCA axes with local structures, we checked them by fitting a null model of trait evolution (NP) through the simulation of a star- shaped phylogenetic tree.Furthermore, to investigate the degree to which edaphic niche characteristics predicts LES variables (and vice versa; i.e. correlated evolution), we employed procrustean randomization tests (Peres- Neto & Jackson, 2001) through the functions procrustes and protest in the ‘vegan’ r package. We compared the pPCA scores obtained for each population in the two axes that explained more variation (PC1 and PC2 for the soil- pPCA; PC1 and PC11 for the LES- pPCA), using 9,999 permutations. A significant high correlation (p < 0.05) between PCs indicated interdependence of datasets and correlated evolution of characteristics.Finally, we also investigated a wide variety of element contents in leaves. Macronutrient uptake and use efficiency in the four D. broteri cytotypes were determined, for each location, by account-ing for the differences between leaves and soils in the concentra-tion of N, K and P (in mg/g of dry matter). The influence of ploidy level on these latter variables was analysed using generalized linear models (one- way ANOVAs) with normal or gamma distribution of errors. Significant results were followed by post- hoc Tukey's HSD tests (α = 0.05) to identify inter- cytotype pairwise differences. All statistical analyses were performed in R software ver. 4.0.0 (R Core Team, 2020).3  |  RESULTSD. broteri populations showed a pattern of inter- cytotype dif-ferentiation in the edaphic space, as represented in the two most explanatory pPCA axes (soil- PC1 and PC2). Both axes explained more than half of the total variance in the edaphic space (37.7% and 20.1%, respectively) and showed positive eigenvalues, so local structures (related to recently diverged traits) had little influence on the variation of soil niche characteristics. Moreover, variable contri-butions on these axes were generally low (always <0.5 in absolute values), revealing high levels of correlation between edaphic vari-ables. Despite this result, the first axis (soil- PC1) clearly mirrored an alkalinity gradient and the second one (soil- PC2) a nutrient content gradient in soils. In this edaphic space, we noticed niche displace-ment and expansion of the polyploid cytotypes, being 4×, 6× and 12× niches clearly different and wider than the 2× one. Thus, dip-loids had the most restricted niche, which almost completely over-lapped the tetraploid space (Figure 1B). Congruently, the two lower cytotypes (2× and 4×) did not present significant differences in any pPCA axis (Figure 1C,D) and they were associated with milder edaphic conditions. Their niches were characterized by clay, semi- acid soils with high EC as well as elevated contents of essential ma-cronutrients (N, P and Ca) and several important micronutrients (Cu and Mn; Figure 1A,B). Oppositely, the 6× cytotype was located in a significantly divergent position of soil- PC1 compared to the rest of ploidies (F3,8 = 6.18; p < 0.05; Figure 1C). In this axis, the niche space of hexaploids corresponded to silty and alkaline soils, with pH ≥ 7 and high levels of total carbonates and active limestone. Lastly, the 12× cytotype appeared in an extreme position of soil- PC2, mar-ginally different from the other cytotypes (F3,8 = 2.37; p = 0.07; Figure 1D). The niche space of dodecaploids in soil- PC2 was related to nutrient- poor soils (except for Fe), with reduced concentrations of all the essential macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg), organic matter and electrical conductivity.D. broteri also demonstrated a notable variation of the LES traits, which was mainly explained by two pPCA axes accounting for 47.7% and 25.0% of the total inertia, respectively (Figure 2A). The first most explanatory axis had a positive eigenvalue but the second one had a negative eigenvalue, indicating that both global and local structures affect to LES covariation in D. broteri. Therefore, in the first axis (LES- PC1), we found the earliest diverged traits, which were those from the classical LES. LES- PC1 reflected inter- cytotype divergence, being the 12× significantly differentiated from the rest of cytotypes (F3,8 = 16.78; p < 0.05; Figure 2C). The dodecaploids were characterized in this axis by high levels of leaf macronutrients (N, P and K) and high PITotal as well as low LMA and δ13C (Figure 2A,B). In this same axis, the other three ploidies overlapped and appeared in more central positions of the pPCA, with LES traits showed by the 2× cytotype encompassing both 4× and 6× (Figure 2B). Nonetheless, hexaploids were occupying the most opposite location in PC1 compared to dodecaploids. The second represented axis (LES- PC11) gathered recently diverged traits and was mainly characterized by photochemical parame-ters (TR/CS, ET/CS, DI/CS and Fv/Fm). The scores of LES- PC11 did not differ among cytotypes (F3,8 = 0.19; p > 0.05), being this axis mostly defined by intra- cytotype variation, specifically within the 4× (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the photosystems efficiency (Fv/Fm) 610  |   Journal of Ecology LÓPEZ- JURADO Et AL.and performance (PITotal) showed opposite patterns for all the ploidies considering their reverse contribution signs in both axes (Figure 2A).Overall, the well- described covariation relationships for func-tional traits from the LES were maintained in D. broteri. A strong positive relationship was found between the essential macronu-trients N and P (r = 0.72; p < 0.05), which were negatively related to δ13C (Figure 3). This isotopic composition was, in turn, neg-atively related to δ15N but positively to LMA. However, photo-chemical variables were separated from the classical LES traits in this covariation network but integrated between them (Figure 3). Thus, the total performance index (PITotal) presented tight positive correlations with the absorbed (ABS/CS; r = 0.62; p < 0.05) and dissipated fluxes (DI/CS; r = 0.90; p < 0.05), but the relationship was markedly negative with Fv/Fm (r = −0.85; p < 0.05). This latter parameter of PSII efficiency was more related to fluxes of pri-mary photochemistry (TR/CS and ET/CS; Figure 3). Furthermore, the direction of fundamental, globally described, leaf trait– trait relationships (those between LMA, N and P; Wright et al., 2004) were maintained within cytotypes.However, we found differences when comparing the coordina-tion of functional traits among ploidies considering the complete network. The 2× cytotype had the highest integration of LES traits, which decreased with polyploidization, being 6× and 12× cytotypes F I G U R E  1  Phylogenetic principal component analysis (pPCA) obtained for the sampled populations of Dianthus broteri, using soil- related variables regarding nutrient composition and physicochemical properties. Only the two axes with greater inertia explained are represented. Panel (A) shows the distribution of the selected variables loading on the axes. Panel (B) presents the edaphic niches of the four cytotypes (ellipses encompass occurrence points) in the two main axes. Panels (C) and (D) are a breakdown of (B) representing each axis separately (soil- PC1 and PC2, respectively). These show the edaphic range of the ploidies as violin plots, where white circles correspond to the median, thick black bars to the interquartile range and thin bars to the 95% confidence interval. Different letters indicate cytotypes that are significantly different from each other (one- way ANOVA: p < 0.05, Tukey's HSD test: α = 0.05).

Additionally, the Mantel tests revealed a greatly dissimilar structure of LES traits (lowest Pearson's r) between dip-loids and the other cytotypes (4×, 6× and 12×; Table S2). In con-trast, these three cytotypes showed similar LES traits covariation matrices, although the Mantel tests were not significant (p > 0.05; Table S2).In both soil and LES pPCAs, we only found significant phyloge-netic signal (K ≥ 1, p < 0.05) for the most explanatory axes (PC1s). The variation in these axes better fitted the OU4 model (i.e. the one con-sidering a scenario with four optima, corresponding to the four cy-totypes), showing AIC weights above 75 (virtually 100 for LES- PC1; Table 2). These results 
supported the conservatism of the edaphic niche and functional traits at population level (i.e. within ploidies), but the divergence among D. broteri cytotypes. Nevertheless, both sets of characteristics were not correlated according to the results of the procrustean tests. The two pairs of pPCA scores did not show a pattern of multivariate concerted evolution, based on their low and non- significant correlation (r = 0.36; p > 0.05).In contrast to the above- mentioned divergence in soil nutrient contents among D. broteri cytotypes, their leaves showed a clearly distinct pattern, marked by significantly higher contents of essen-tial macronutrients in the 12× cytotype (C, N, P and K; p < 0.05; Table S3) and a greater variation in the 2× cytotype (as indicated its overall higher standard errors; Table S3). Thus, nutrient acquisition and accumulation rates and efficiencies differed among ploidies, es-pecially affecting 6× and 12×.

Thus, the 12× cytotype had significantly greater differences in N than the rest of ploidies (ANOVA: F3,8 = 6.66; p < 0.05; Figure 4A).

However, an early post- polyploidization character displace-ment caused by competition for niche space (Beans, 2014) or niche filling cannot be ruled out. The highest cytotypes (6× and 12×) would have been displaced to stressful environmental edges with much poorer soils in terms of macronutrient content and potential availability than the lower cytotypes (López- Jurado et al., 2019). Furthermore, the divergence pattern was accompanied by an expansion of the edaphic niche in polyploids, which could be linked with amplified ecological tol-erances (Molina- Henao & Hopkins, 2019; te Beest et al., 2012) and/or enhanced competitive abilities (Rey et al., 2017).4.2  |  Divergent positioning along the LES associated with polyploidyAlthough soil variables are supposed to be the strongest environ-mental predictors of leaf traits (Maire et al., 2015), the results of the procrustean tests linking edaphic niche characteristics and LES variables suggested that they are not coevolving. Nevertheless, functional traits related to nutrient (N, P and K) and water economy (δ13C) explained by LES- PC1 also showed an early divergence (global structure) associated with polyploidization. Leal- Bertioli et al. (2017) and Wei et al. (2020) also demonstrated large effects of polyploidy per se on leaf morphology and anatomy by finding analogous results in wild and induced polyploids. Moreover, Münzbergová and Haisel (2019) found a similar pattern for the photosynthetic pigment con-tents in autotetraploids.In agreement with soil- PC1, each cytotype reached a different LES- PC1 optimum given the highest performance of OU4 models. Thus, divergent selection was the major force driving the evolution of D. broteri polyploids in functional traits and soil niche character-istics, which agreed with a scenario of inter- cytotypic competitive interactions (Laport et al., 2013; Rey et al., 2017). In contrast to its most restricted edaphic niche, the 2× cytotype had the overall greatest variation in leaf nutrient concentrations. This fact could be explained by larger pools of genetic variation in this cytotype than the other ploidies (Balao et al., 2010). Notwithstanding the higher genetic variation of the diploids, they showed reduced leaf nutri-ent contents, which were similar to those of 4× and 6× cytotypes. However, we would have expected the leaf nutrients to be increased in the polyploids based on the greater need for these in taxa with larger genomes (Leitch & Leitch, 2008) and the complex polygenic uptake mechanisms for essential macronutrients (N, P and K; Lea & Azevedo, 2006; Vance et al., 2003; Véry & Sentenac, 2003), which would be facilitated by post- polyploidization processes (Cheng et al., 2018). This finding could be explained by the phenotypic dip-loidization phenomenon, an evolutionary tendency of returning to diploid- like phenotype which has been recently demonstrated for photosynthetic characteristics of established D. broteri 4× individu-als (Domínguez- Delgado et al., 2021).Oppositely, the highest- order cytotype (12×) showed, as ex-pected, an elevated leaf accumulation of K, P and N. On the basis of the low- P and N soils where the 12× ploidy is distributed, their elevated content in leaves would be useful for dealing with uncer-tainties in availability (Clarkson et al., 2005; Ostertag, 2010; Ruiz- Navarro et al., 2016). Moreover, dodecaploids would benefit from a higher K content because this element has a key role in numerous stress response mechanisms (e.g. drought, cold or salinity; Wang et al., 2013).In the D. broteri complex, LES- PC1 reflected the acquisitive- conservative continuum (fast– slow, sensu Reich, 2014), which was in accordance with water- use strategies (through δ13C) as Prieto et al. (2018) described in other Mediterranean species. Meanwhile, the highest ploidy (12×) occupied an extreme of the continuum, the second highest ploidy (6×) was located at the opposite extreme, and 2× and 4× filled more intermediate spaces. The 6× cytotype showed a nutrient and water- conservative or slow strategy (i.e. high LMA, low leaf nutrient accumulation plus high δ13C), whereas the 12× cytotype presented a nutrient and water- acquisitive or rapid strat-egy (i.e. low LMA, high leaf nutrient accumulation plus low δ13C). The 12× cytotype showed the lowest intrinsic water- use efficiency (iWUE; estimated from leaf δ13C), which would explain its elevated leaf nutrient concentrations since the low iWUE is offset with high nutrient uptake efficiency through increased stomatal conductance (gs; Cramer et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the other highly drought- exposed cytotype (6×) would prioritize water conservation (causing high iWUE) through the alleged reduction of gs. The functioning at lower internal CO2 concentrations (Ci) would help to reduce water loss (Goud et al., 2019). Additionally, the higher LMA in hexaploids would allow a better adjustment of leaf water potential with small changes in water content (optimizing water uptake from dry soils; Niinemets, 2001) and, at the same time, the alleviation of extreme heat stress (Leigh et al., 2012) and the adaptation to high light in-tensities (Poorter et al., 2009). Congruently, high- LMA species have been extensively associated with semi- arid Mediterranean environ-ments as the one inhabited by the 6× cytotype (e.g. Costa- Saura et al., 2016; de la Riva et al., 2016). However, increased LMA entails generally low photosynthetic rates (AN), since it would limit CO2 dif-fusion through the mesophyll (Tomás et al., 2013), as well as N in-vestment in photosynthetic proteins because of the higher cell wall mass fraction (Onoda et al., 2017).Interestingly, the rapid or acquisitive strategy characterizing the 12× cytotype cannot be maintained indefinitely in a peren-nial plant (Onoda et al., 2017). Therefore, this functional strategy should be promoted in periods of opportunity, limiting the growing season to when water and nutrients become sufficiently available (Querejeta et al., 2018). These adaptations would enable D. broteri dodecaploids to cope with the remarkably seasonal Mediterranean climate under which they live, with highly variable precipitation events (Deitch et al., 2017) and long dry spells (Sánchez et al., 2011). Supporting this hypothesis, we have found stomatal closure and in-creased iWUE during summer in the 12× cytotype (López- Jurado et al., 2019).614  |   Journal of Ecology LÓPEZ- JURADO Et AL.4.3  |  The impact of polyploidization and  subsequent local processes on phenotypic integration and the flexibility of photochemical responsesDespite the mentioned acquisitive- conservative adaptative strategies were defined by a common network of functional traits for all the cy-totypes, a gradual uncoupling of these traits was found with increas-ing ploidy. Interestingly, the same pattern was previously detected in D. broteri using a multivariate morphological study of reproductive and vegetative traits (Balao et al., 2011). The enhanced allelic diver-sity in autopolyploids (Parisod et al., 2010) could lead to transgressive associations in the pleiotropic genes regulating LES trait covariation, then promoting novel extreme phenotypes (Vasseur et al., 2012). The strong selection on specific adaptive traits during initial phases after polyploid formation would have also contributed to the LES uncoupling in D. broteri polyploids. Thus, the higher phenotypic flexibility exhibited by polyploids may facilitated the rapid adaptation of D. broteri 4×, 6× and 12× cytotypes to overcome the initial minority cytotype exclusion (Husband et al., 2016; Oswald & Nuismer, 2011).Nonetheless, divergent selection was not the only driver of functional variation in this complex. The local structures of LES- PC11 (mainly explained by photochemical parameters) suggested a rela-tive role of local selection and/or plasticity, which had already been proposed for the evolution of this complex (Alonso et al., 2016; López- Jurado et al., 2020). In addition, LES- PC11 occupied a dif-ferent and independent functional dimension from LES- PC1 as a likely effect of inherent physiological constraints, given that shade tolerance is independent of the tolerance to other abiotic stresses (Puglielli et al., 2021). However, although the four cytotypes clearly overlapped in the LES- PC11, polyploids (4×, 6× and 12×) showed higher variation compared to diploids, highlighting the effect of polyploidy on promoting phenotypic plasticity and local adapta-tion (Chen, 2007; Hahn et al., 2012). The high flexibility and inde-pendence of the photochemical behaviour of D. broteri polyploids would contribute to the colonization of heterogeneous light micro- environments at any soil– climate interaction (summarized in soil- pPCA and López- Jurado et al., 2019). Interestingly, the highest- order cytotype (12×) showed the highest constitutive PITotal together with the lowest Fv/Fm. This opposite pattern might depend on the con-trasting performance of photosystems. While Fv/Fm only accounted for PSII efficiency, PITotal is calculated from both PSI and PSII yields. In this regard, PSII could be more prone to ploidy dosage effects due to its larger number of subunits and regulatory loci (Coate et al., 2011), which could cause misassembled PSII complexes, impairing photochemical performance in high polyploids (Baena- González & Aro, 2002; Hwang et al., 2008).4.4  |  Final remarksAlthough singularities in the LES at the intraspecific level have been detected (Fajardo & Siefert, 2018), our straightforward results suggest that polyploidy can be a powerful driving force overcoming limitations in LES universality across evolutionary scales and levels of organization. The results of this study, together with the rapid radiation of polyploid races within D. broteri (Balao et al., 2010), sug-gested an ongoing scenario of diversification similar to the one found in Allium (governed by a high ploidy diversity and ecological drivers; Han et al., 2020). We demonstrated that inter- cytotype trait diver-gence in D. broteri is mostly caused by short- term consequences of whole- genome duplication and captured by the LES (almost 50% of the total functional variance was explained by LES- PC1). Trait novelty in early generations of polyploid races would be then re-lated to the higher adaptive and niche exploring capacity of these polyploid genomes to overcome fitness disadvantage compared to diploids (Baker et al., 2017). The dominance of polyploidization effects over subsequent evolution in D. broteri functional traits is likely explained by the relatively recent divergence of the cytotypes (Balao et al., 2010), as Čertner et al. (2019) proposed for Knautia ser-pentinicola. Nevertheless, we have also shown the influence of local processes after polyploidization events, such as adaptation and phe-notypic plasticity, on the divergence of D. broteri polyploids through their photochemical responses under variations in environmental conditions. To date, there are 
no additional studies demonstrating these patterns together, especially dealing with several cytotypes and using a multi- resource- based LES, accounting for nutrient, water and light. Albeit this line of research clearly deserves further inves-tigation, our work is the first one unambiguously reflecting the LES mediated by autopolyploidy at the microevolutionary scale. Finally, we generated new evidence for the inclusion of photochemical vari-ables as an additional dimension of the LES to explain light acquisi-tion and use in plants.ACKNOWLEDG EMENTSWe thank the University of Seville Herbarium and Mass Spectrometry General Services for their collaboration and providing facilities and equipment.
