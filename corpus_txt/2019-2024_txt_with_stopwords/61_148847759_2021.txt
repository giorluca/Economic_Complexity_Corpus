It enormously increases economiesnational healthcare bills and death tolls that deprive the globalworld. The negative environmental externality further strains thecountry’s healthcare sustainability agenda, causing to decline inglobal income. The study evaluates the different socio-economicand environmental factors to assess ecological complexity in alarge, cross-country data set that includes 60 countries. The studyused the following variables for estimation, i.e., coronavirus cases,cost of carbon emissions, per capita economic growth, foreign dir-ect investment inflows, and population growth. Markov SwitchingRegression, VAR Granger causality and variance decompositionanalysis applied on the given dataset. The results show that theCOVID-19 cases have a rebound effect on environmental quality.Economic activities started after a lifted lockdown, and unsustain-able production and consumption led to a deteriorating naturalenvironment. The U-shaped relationship is found between carbonpollution and per capita income. On the other hand, the invertedU-shaped relationship is found between coronavirus cases andcarbon pollution. The foreign direct investment inflows and popu-lation density increases carbon pollution. The study concludesthat stringent environmental policies and incentive-based regula-tions help to minimize coronavirus cases and mitigate car-bon pollution.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 2 August 2021Accepted 16 October 2021KEYWORDSCarbon damages; COVID-19pandemic; GDP per capita;FDI inflows; populationdensity; switchingregressionJEL CODESC21; I18; J171.

The transmitted diseases called corona-virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) was coined by WHO as a ’pandemic’ in March 2020.The disease spread out from the Hubei province of Wuhan, China, and penetratedthe global world. The data is readily available at the WHO and other databases,which shows the high infected cases and deaths by coronavirus disease in the USA,followed by India, Brazil, Russia, and the UK (Worldometer, 2021).Global warming is the volatile factor that is increased by the greater stock of car-bon emissions in the atmosphere. International organizations and environmental pro-tection agencies significantly reduce such emissions through sustainable and cleanertechnologies (Shao et al., 2020). The relationship between carbon emissions and eco-nomic growth is widely evident in the environmental science literature that proclaimsthat economic growth is somehow responsible for increasing carbon emissions at cer-tain threshold levels. In contrast, after reaching its destination, economic growthmoves towards smart and green technologies that help to reduce carbon emissions.This relationship is mainly inverted U-shaped, called Environmental Kuznets Curve(EKC), but it also depends on the country’s sustainable efforts to reduce such emis-sions (Suki et al., 2020). The government’s easy economic and environmental policiesfurther strain the natural environment through more significant inbound FDI thatpollute the environment. This phenomenon is widely understanding with the’Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH)’. Tight government regulations, either formal orinformal, help reduce carbon emissions (Sadik-Zada & Ferrari, 2020; Wang et al.,2019). Moreover, the pollution exacerbated by increasing population growth, afflu-ence, and technology, the I-PAT hypothesis, needs to be reduced through humancapital formation, sustainable economic growth, and cleaner technologies(Chontanawat, 2019). These hypotheses are under investigation in this study withsome modifications that we called up with the ‘alternative’ hypothesis. The studyused the EKC hypothesis, PHH, and I-PAT hypothesis. It extended these hypothesesinto alternative ones, i.e., pandemic Kuznets curve (PKC), Pandemic pollution haven(PPH) hypothesis and pandemic-population-pollution (PPP) hypothesis in a cross-section of 60 selected countries.The study has filled the literature gap by comparing alternative and plausibleenvironmental hypotheses during the pandemic crisis that has been less exploredrecently, leading to misspecified healthcare policies globally. The rise and fall in thecarbon emissions per capita due to continuing per capita income of the countries arewidely discussed under the central theme of ‘environmental Kuznets curve (EKC)’(see, Anser et al., 2020a, 2021a; Apergis & Ozturk, 2015; Dinda, 2004; Nassani et al.,2017). In comparison, little is discussed in the pandemic crisis that has possible arebound effect on environmental quality to increase the costs of carbon emissionsglobally (see, Aljadani et al., 2021; Jozwik & Gruszecki, 2020). The study filled thisgap and assessed the EKC hypothesis and pandemic Kuznets curve (PKC) in carboncost modelling to determine viable healthcare sustainable policies across countries.The EKC hypothesis was formally analyzed by the non-linear functional relationshipbetween per capita carbon emissions and countries’ per capita income (and thesquare of per capita income) to find the different possible hump-shaped relationshipsbetween them. The PKC is analyzed by the relationship between carbon damages and3398 J. JIA ET AL.the square of per capita income (and share of GDP’s per capita relative to COVID-19cases) to obtain the possible shapes across countries. Figure 1 shows the differentforms of possible EKC hypothesis and PKC hypothesis for ready reference.Figure 1 illustrated that the EKC and PKC hypotheses either confirmed theinverted U-shaped, U-shaped, N-shaped, monotonic increasing or decreasing, or flatrelationship between the variables. The point of interest is that the PKC shapes haveless diameter than EKC shapes because the pandemic crisis is likely short. It will besettled down after adopting strict, standardized operating procedures to control cor-onavirus cases. Another environmental hypothesis mainly discussed before the pan-demic crisis was the ‘pollution haven’ (PH) hypothesis. This hypothesis accounts fordealing with foreign production in the homeland that negatively influenced the hostcountries’ environmental quality, affecting the world by the ease of environmentalregulations. Several scholarly contributions have been worked on the stated hypoth-esis and found some interesting findings that conclude it with the adoption of strin-gent environmental regulations to control dirty production (see Anser et al., 2021b;Cole, 2004; Liu et al., 2019; Nassani et al., 2019; Solarin et al., 2017; Zaman & Abd-elMoemen, 2017). The study takes an added advantage to analyze the pandemic pollu-tion have (PPH) hypothesis by incorporating the share of FDI’s relative to COVID-19cases in the carbon cost modelling across countries. Few studies indirectly found thestated hypothesis necessary in policy formulation (see Elliott et al., 2020; Erokhin &Gao, 2020; Wang & Wang, 2020). Figure 2 shows the PH and PPH hypothesis forready reference.Finally, the study evaluated ‘population-induced emissions’ widely explored by theIPAT hypothesis in earlier studies. The IPAT hypothesis shows the emissions inten-sity subject to population growth, affluence, and technology (see Hishan et al., 2019;Nassani et al., 2021; Ozcan & Ulucak, 2020). In contrast, there is little evidence dur-ing the current pandemic crisis explored in this study concerning the moderation useFigure 1. Different shapes of EKC and PKC hypothesis.Source: adapted from Dinda (2004), and Aljadani et al. (2021).ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 3399of COVID-19 cases with population density. This phenomenon is representing withthe ‘pandemic-population-pollution (PPP)’ hypothesis. The study assumed that popu-lation compactness causes increasing COVID-19 cases and environmental destruction,thus negatively impacting countries’ environmental sustainability agenda. Figure 3shows the IPAT and PPP hypothesis for ready reference.The current literature on the stated theme is limited; however, in the case ofspreading the knowledge to the general audience, the study mentioned the followingliterature to quickly followed the earlier research contributions on the environmentalsustainability agenda in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Table 1 shows currentliterature on the stated theme for ready reference.Based on the cited literature, the study presented the contribution of the study.The study is first in its nature that evaluated different alternative and plausible envir-onmental-health hypotheses associated with the COVID-19 cases across countries.The main hypotheses include, i) pandemic Kuznets curve that follows the relation-ships between the square of per capita income and GDP’s share in COVID-19 cases,which established the inverted U-shaped relationship between them, ii) pandemic pol-lution haven hypothesis refers to the situation where the share of FDI’s inflows rela-tive to COVID-19 increases the cost of carbon emissions, which ultimately affect thegreen growth developmental agenda globally, and iii) pandemic-population-pollutionhypothesis is the amalgamation of the COVID-19 cases, population density, and car-bon damages that refers the situation where the share of population density relativeFigure 2.

Second, the study used different moderating and mediating factors linkedwith the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the magnitude of stated factors to affect airquality indicators across the countries. Finally, the study analyzed the stated hypothe-ses in the inter-temporal forecasting framework that helped devise future healthcarepolicies for developing green growth agendas. Based on the study’s contribution, thestudy’s objectives are to examine the rebound effect of the COVID-19 pandemic oncarbon damages. Further, the study evaluated the non-linear relationship between percapita income and carbon damages in the wave of COVID-19 cases across countries.Table 1.

The statedobjectives need to be checked by sophisticated statistical techniques to get robust par-ameter inferences for devising healthcare policies across countries.2. Data and methodological frameworkThe study used carbon damages (CARB_DAM, % of GNI) as a ‘response’ variable. Incontrast, COVID-19 cases (denoted by COVID19, in numbers), GDP per capita(denoted by GDP_PC, constant 20201US$), FDI inflows (denoted by FDI_INF, % ofGDP), and population density (denoted by POP_DEN) used as explanatory variables.Besides, the study used different moderating and mediating factors to evaluate alterna-tive and plausible environmental hypotheses, including, i) square of GDP_PC (denotedby SQGDP_PC), ii) an interaction term of POP_DEN and COVID19 (denoted byPOP_DENCOVID19), iii) the share of GDP_PC relative to COVID19 (denotedby GDP_PC/COVID19), and iv) the share of FDI_INF relative to COVID19 (denotedby FDI_INF/COVID19). Table 2 shows the list of sample countries used in the studyfor ready reference.The stated variables evaluated the following environmental hypotheses, i.e.,i. Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) Hypothesis: The rise and fall in the carbondamages associated with the increase and mega increase in the 
countries percapita income describe the EKC hypothesis (see, Anser et al., 2021b; Chenget al., 2021; Koondhar et al., 2021). The study used GDP_PC and SQGDP_PC inthe functional relationship with the CARB_DAM to evaluate the EKC hypothesisin a cross-section of 60 countries.ii. Pandemic Kuznets Curve (PKC) Hypothesis: The study assumes that doubling theGDP_PC leads to a deteriorating natural environment. Simultaneously, the shareof GDP_PC relative to COVID19 would likely decrease carbon damages, leadingto spending more money on healthcare resources and its infrastructure thathelps move forward towards achieving the healthcare sustainability agenda glo-bally. This phenomenon is referred to as the PKC hypothesis.iii. Pollution Haven (PH) Hypothesis: Generally, the pollution haven hypothesisdescribes the role of dirty polluting industries that get benefited from the ease ofenvironmental regulations to deteriorate the natural environment, whichaccounts for increasing FDI inflows on the cost of carbon emissions (see Ahmadet al., 2021; Anser et al., 2020b). The study used the same concept to evaluatethe PH hypothesis to observe any additional increase in carbon damages associ-ated with the inbound FDI across countries.Table 2.

JIA ET AL.iv. Pandemic Pollution Haven (PPH) Hypothesis: The study assumes that the shareof increasing FDI inflows in reducing coronavirus cases would likely increasecarbon damages due to increased commercialization activities across countries.Hence, the study considers the share of FDI_INF relative to COVID19 as amediating factor in modelling carbon emissions to confirm the PPH hypothesisacross countries.v. Population-Induced Emissions (IPAT) Hypothesis: The IPAT hypothesis generallyrefers to the economic situation where emissions intensity changes the popula-tion growth, affluence, and technology (Tarazkar et al., 2020; Yue et al., 2020).The growth rate of population leads to increase carbon damages, which isobserved in the study by using population density as a determinantal factor thatsabotaged the environmental sustainability agenda worldwide, andvi. Pandemic-Population-Pollution (PPP) Hypothesis: The study assumes that popu-lation density is the causal factor in increasing the exposure of coronavirus cases;as greater the population compactness, the greater the possibility to get exposedto the contagious diseases. Hence, the study used the moderation of POP_DENand COVID19 cases to explore the impact on carbon damages to support thePPP hypothesis.Based on the theoretical support, the study formulated the empirical equation toexplore the dynamics of COVID-19 cases and carbon damages under different mod-eration and mediating variables in a cross-section panel of 60 countries, i.e.,CARB DAM60, 2021 ¼ C0 þ C1COVID1960, 2021 þ C2GDP PC60, 2021 þ C3SQGDP PC60, 2021þC4 GDP PCCOVID19 60, 2021þ C5FDI INF60, 2021 þ C6 FDI INFCOVID 60, 2021þ C7POP DEN60, 2021þC8ðPOP DEN  COVID19Þ60, 2021 þ e60, 2021[oCARB DAMCOVID19 >0; oCARB DAMGDP PC >0; oCARB DAMSQGDP PC9 <0; oCARB DAMGDP PC=COVID19 <0;oCARB DAMFDI INF >0; oCARB DAMFDI INF=COVID19 >0; oCARB DAMPOP DEN >0; oCARB DAMPOP DEN  COVID19 >0(1)where CARB_DAM shows carbon damages, COVID19 shows COVID-19 cases,GDP_PC shows GDP per capita, FDI_INF shows FDI inflows, POP_DEN showspopulation density, and e shows error term.Equation (1) shows that COVID-19 cases would likely increase by increasing car-bon damages. Simultaneously, there is likely to get a hump-shaped relationshipbetween countries’ per capita income and carbon damages across countries.Moreover, the share of countries per capita income relative to COVID-19 is expectedto decrease carbon damages to support the pandemic Kuznets curve hypothesis. Theinbound FDI is expected to harm the natural environment to exacerbate carbon emis-sions. Further, its share of COVID19 cases is likely to increase carbon damages tosupport the PH and PPH hypotheses, respectively. The population density is expectedto establish the negative impact on carbon damages to support the IPAT hypothesis.In contrast, its moderation negatively impacts environmental pollution to support theECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 3403PPP hypothesis across countries. The following hypotheses need to be verified undercarbon pandemic modelling in a panel of selected countries, i.e.,H1: The likelihood that COVID-19 cases increase along with an increase in carbondamages across countries.H2: The inverted U-shaped relationship is expected in a combination of differentvariables relative to carbon damages to support EKC and PKC hypothesis, andH3: FDI inflows, population density, and COVID-19 cases support PH, PPH, andPPP hypotheses.The stated hypotheses need to be checked using different statistical techniques,including the Switching regression approach, Granger causality estimates, and vari-ance decomposition analysis for sound inferences. The Markov switching two-regimeanalysis helps analyze the non-linear relationship between the variables in differentm-stage regime regressions. The stated modelling approach assumed many m-regres-sion equations for each statistical analysis to check the regression parameters with’common’ factors. The dynamic relationship can be found by including the laggeddependent variable in the switching regression approach to observe the possible het-eroskedasticity and serial correlation issues accordingly. The study added non-linearfactors in the ’common’ regression to analyze the variables’ inverted U-shaped rela-tionships. Based on the results, the study moves forward to estimate Granger causalrelationship between the linear and non-linear variables resulting in an impact oncarbon damages across countries. The following hypothesis need to be checked in theschematic fashion of causality, i.e.,Postulate-I: Carbon damages Granger cause COVID-19 and other factors while thereverse also holds for the stated variables. Thus, it confirmed the bidirectional rela-tionship between them.Postulate-II: There is a one-way linkage between the variables, i.e., carbon damagesGranger cause COVID-19 cases and other factors, while the reverse does not hold forother causation. Thus, it confirmed the unidirectional relationship between them.Postulate-III: The revere causality exists in COVID-19 cases and carbon damagesunder different moderating and mediating factors, but the reverse does not hold.Thus, it confirmed the reverse causation between them, andPostulate-IV: The stated variables do not Granger cause each other. Thus, it sup-ports the neutrality hypothesis.Finally, the study used variance decomposition analysis (VDA) under the VARmodelling framework under different lag operators. The forecast error decompositionallows to foresight the relationship between the stated variables over a time horizon.The greater magnitude of the variable on the main regression factor helps determinethe frequency and size to predict the future change direction.3.

In contrast, the aver-age per capita income of the cross-sectional panel of 60 countries is reached atUS$22,389.09. The inbound FDI has a greater value of 28.346% of GDP while itsmean value is 3.039%. The square of GDP per capita and its share in the COVID-19pandemic was used for analyzing the pandemic Kuznets curve hypothesis thatreached their average value of US$9.52Eþ 08 and US$0.122, respectively. The positiveaverage value of FDI and population density’s share in COVID-19 would help todetermine the existence of the pandemic pollution haven hypothesis and pandemic-population-pollution emissions hypothesis, respectively.Table 4 shows the Markov switching regression estimates and found that theCOVID19 cases increase carbon damage in regime 1. At the same time, this result ispowerless to explain the relationship in regime 2. The result implies that coronaviruscases’ rebound effect would likely worsen than negatively affect the natural environ-ment once life returns and lockdowns are lifted worldwide. There is a negative rela-tionship between countries’ per capita income and carbon damages, implying thatcountries spent an enormous amount of money improving air quality. At the sametime, at later stages, once pandemic emerged, its negative impact on countries’income and output level, which exacerbate carbon damages. Thus, the U-shaped rela-tionship exhibited between the two factors during a pandemic crisis. The pandemicTable 4.

JIA ET AL.Kuznets curve (PKC) is evaluated by doubling the countries per capita income andthe share of per capita income relative to the COVID-19 pandemic and found thatcontinued per capita income damages carbon emissions. Simultaneously, the greatersum of money devoted to healthcare infrastructure and environmental resource con-servation helps to decrease carbon damages. Thus, it substantiates the PKC hypothesisacross countries. The impact of FDI inflows on carbon emissions is not statisticallysignificant in both regimes. However, the share of inbound FDI to COVID19 casesincreases carbon damages, supporting the ’pandemic pollution haven’ hypothesisacross countries. There is a negative relationship between population density and car-bon damages, implying that sustainable cities and smart building constructions playedan important role in decreasing carbon damage. On the other hand, coronaviruscases’ moderation effect on population density leads to increased carbon damages. Itneeds to be contained in coronavirus cases and reduce carbon emissions through sus-tainable health care policies. The result confirmed the pandemic-population-pollutionhypothesis across countries.The study results confirmed the following hypotheses that were designed duringthe wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the COVID-19 pandemic is not limitedto damages healthcare infrastructure while negatively affecting the environmental sus-tainability agenda across countries. The result is quite interesting, as due to strictlockdown in many parts of the globe, economic activities were decreases that substan-tially decreased carbon emissions. In contrast, economic activities increase after theCOVID-19 first wave, which amplifies the cost of carbon emissions across countries.Thus, the rebound effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environmental sustain-ability agenda is another threat for the countries to maintain global average tempera-ture less than 1.5 C. Secondly, the study postulates that the relationship between percapita income and carbon damages will be hump-shaped. The result confirmed thenon-linear relationship between the stated variables. The economic activities initiallysupported reducing carbon damages because of strict measures adopted by the gov-ernment to contain coronavirus cases; however, after lifted the lockdown, the eco-nomic activities enormously increased, increasing carbon damages across countries.Third, the percentage share of FDI inflows relative to COVID1-19 cases exacerbatedcarbon damages to support the pandemic Kuznets curve, another deteriorating factorthat needs to be controlled through stringent government regulations. Finally, thestudy found that population density increases coronavirus cases due to increasedsocial bindings among the population, leading to healthcare damages and environ-mental damages to verify the pandemic-population-pollution hypothesis across coun-tries. These results we believe would be helpful to proposed sound healthcaresustainable policies to contain coronavirus cases and carbon damages worldwide.Comunian et al. (2020) found a high correlation between coronavirus cases and par-ticulate matter emissions that negatively affect the individual’s health, damaging lungcells and cause inflammation, which probably increases the high susceptibility of thecoronavirus cases globally. Silva et al. (2021) concluded that plastic pollution wasfound higher during the coronavirus pandemic, which leads to a deteriorating naturalenvironment and causes many healthcare inflammations, not limited to respiratoryand lung diseases. A greater need to make sustainable policies for environmentalECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 3407protection and coronavirus cases to address plastic pollution worldwide. Wang andWang (2020) suggested that countries should be well prepared for the rebound effectof the COVID-19 pandemic to improve energy efficiency, carbon reduction, and sus-tainable development, which reduces carbon damages and coronavirus cases accord-ingly. Mishra et al. (2020) found the negative impact of stock market efficiencyduring the pandemic crisis, which led to severe financial depression across the globe.Bacchetta et al. (2021) argued that the COVID-19 pandemic largely disrupted the glo-bal value chains, including goods trading, healthcare logistics supply, and inventorymanagement, which led to the severe global recession.Table 5 shows the 
VAR Granger causality estimates for ready reference. The resultsconfirmed the bidirectional causality between per capita income and FDI’s share inCOVID19 and between the square of GDP per capita and FDI’s share in COVID19.The result implies that per capita income is the crucial factor that increases inboundFDI to reduce coronavirus cases across countries. On the other hand, the study foundthe unidirectional causality running from i) carbon damages to FDI inflows, popula-tion density, and FDI’s share in COVID19 cases, ii) COVID19 to FDI inflows andshare of population density to COVID19 cases, iii) GDP per capita to COVID-19cases and FDI inflows, iv) FDI inflows to GDP’s share in COVID19, v) populationdensity to countries per capita income, FDI inflows, and GDP’s and FDI’s share inCOVID19, and vi) population density to COVID-19 cases. The result implies thatCOVID-19 cases increase healthcare financing that elevated inbound FDI acrosscountries. Further, continued economic growth increases coronavirus cases andinbound FDI accordingly. Finally, population density increases GDP’s and FDI’s sharein COVID-19 cases along with countries per capita income and inbound FDI, whichdetermine the link between population density and spread of coronavirus casesacross countries.Table 6 shows the VDA estimates of carbon damages in a panel of selected coun-tries. The results suggested that the share of FDI inflows in COVID19 cases will havea greater magnitude to effect carbon damages with a forecast variance of 24.759%,followed by a share of GDP per capita in COVID-19 cases, population density, FDIinflows, and per capita income with a variance of 9.060%, 5.536%, 4.449%, and3.553%, respectively. The least influenced will be population-induced carbon damagesbecause of sustainable healthcare reforms with a variance of 0.035% for thenext months.4. Discussion4.1. Conceptual contributionThe study’s results align with the ’healthcare signalling’ hypothesis, which argued thatthe positive healthcare signals could be delivered to the community members byaddressing socio-economic and environmental issues in the wake of the COVID-19pandemic. The world faced severe financial depression due to an unprecedentedincrease in the national healthcare bills to combat coronavirus cases, which affectedthe green development projects.

ConclusionsThe study’s objective is to evaluate different environmental hypotheses in the wave ofthe COVID-19 pandemic that negatively affects the inbound FDI and countries’ eco-nomic output. The rebound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would likely increasethe cost of carbon emissions, while continued economic growth and population dens-ity influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbate carbon damages across coun-tries. The study confirmed the pandemic Kuznets curve, pandemic pollution havenhypothesis, and pandemic-population-pollution hypothesis in the cross-sectional panelof 60 countries. The results confirmed the different cause-effect relationships betweenthe stated variables, confirming the inter-temporal forecasting formwork that helpedpropose sound policy inferences globally. General policiesBased on the study’s results, the following general and specific policies are sug-gested that followed to achieve healthcare sustainability agenda across countries, i.e.,i. rebound effect of COVID-19 pandemic on environmental degradation: The globalworld has taken many necessary measures to control coronavirus cases, indir-ectly impacting air quality indicators to achieve environmental sustainabilityagenda. Although the steps taken to control coronavirus cases cannot be pro-longed due to decreasing economic output and efficiency, once the lockdownsituation is lifted and economic activities begin to resume, the cost of carbonemissions is likely to increase at a tremendous rate. Hence, the rebound effect ofthe COVID-19 pandemic needs to be assessed, and policies should be drawn tokeep control of carbon emissions for moving towards green growthagenda globally.ii. adopting green financing projects in the wave of COVID-19 pandemic: Financialdevelopment was severely disrupted during the pandemic, leading the globaleconomies into a financial depression. Further, it increases the costs of carbonemissions that need to be controlled through advancement in cleaner productiontechnologies and investment in the healthcare sustainability agenda that helpcontrol financial and healthcare pandemics accordingly.iii. intelligent cities planning to avoid population compactness: The increased popula-tion density causes social interaction that quickly transmits contagious diseasesamong the masses. Hence, it is necessary to adopt smart city planning and infra-structure development, which reduces infectious diseases and allows the popula-tions to participate in environmental protection.iv. Specific policiesECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 3411The more specific policies related to the study’s findings are proposed accord-ingly, i.e., The study’s results show that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on carbon dam-ages is positive, which confirms the adversity of contagious disease for environmentalsustainability. The stringent policies measures to control coronavirus cases initiallysupported low carbon pollution because of strict/partial lockdowns in the cities andtravel and transportation restrictions; however, it damages the natural environmentwhen coronavirus cases substantially decline and resuming economic activities.Further, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, sustainable environmental meas-ures were stopped, and the world is trying to minimize coronavirus cases, whichobstructs the green developmental agenda. There is a time to refocus on sustainableenvironmental policies by innovative cleaner technologies and command-and-controlmechanisms to move towards a healthy and clean developmental agenda. The U-shaped relationship between per capita income and carbon damages in thewake of the COVID-19 pandemic shows some leakages in the existing economicpolicies that cannot control carbon damages, leading to adversely affected health-care sustainability agenda. The governments need to pay attention to economicproduction and healthcare supply chain to minimize carbon damages by incen-tive-based regulations, including the polluters-pay principle, carbon offset policies,and sustainable fuels used in logistics operations, and The pollution haven hypothesis is verified during the COVID-19 pandemic, asdirty production damages economic production and environmental sustainabilityagenda, adversely affecting the health infrastructure across countries. The Pareto-efficient outcome can be achieved by restricting polluting firms through stringentenvironmental regulations, including, imposition of carbon taxes and emissions-cap trading instruments to revitalize sustainable economic development.The limitation of the study provides a basis for future directions research. Thestudy can be improved by extending it to some specific world’s regions and for indi-vidual countries to assess the efforts to control coronavirus cases at country-wide andregion-wise analysis. Further, more variables can be added in a given model to obtainmore generalized insights about the relationships between the variables including,supply chain factors, healthcare expenditures, coronavirus tests, coronavirus vaccines,and greenfield investment. These vital critical considerations need to be implementedto ensure green and clean economic development that helps it avoid any contagiousdiseases across countries.AcknowledgementsResearchers Supporting Project number (RSP-2021/87), King Saud University, Riyadh,Saudi Arabia.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).3412 J.
