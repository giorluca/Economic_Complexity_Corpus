UNIVERSITÀ DEGLI STUDI DI PADOVA  DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, LAW AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES  Master’s degree in Human Rights and Multi-level Governance      IS DEVELOPMENT STILL POSSIBLE?   A STUDY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS    Supervisor: Prof. ROBERTO ANTONIETTI  Candidate: JESSIE PAVAN BORSATTO                             Matriculation No. 2004549     A.Y. 2021/2022   Abstract  Economic complexity is an economic theory and measure created by Cesar Hidalgo and Ricardo Hausmann in 2009 that captures through the outputs of an economy the capabilities contained in it and determines its level of complexity with regard to other countries. There is evidence that the economic complexity of a country is positively related to its economic growth possibilities. Economic complexity guides the industrial and development policies of some countries and regions. Nevertheless, for economic complexity to be considered a sustainable development strategy with human well-being as the final goal, its relationship with other areas needs to be investigated. This monograph studies the relationship of economic complexity with human rights, with the following research questions: Is economic complexity positively correlated to human rights? If so, what are the possibilities and obstacles to countries' complexification? To answer the research questions, a multi-method approach that includes a case study of South Korea's development and a quantitative study using regression analysis of cross-country panel data on the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and the Social Progress Index (SPI) for more than 120 countries for the period 2010-2019 were used. Lastly, a qualitative analysis was done on the challenges and opportunities developing countries can have to implement an economic complexity development strategy considering international trade, technology dominance and corporate power, as well as macro issues such as climate change, income and wealth inequality, demographic dynamics and multilateralism. The case study showed an apparent relationship between the economic development strategy adopted by South Korea and the improvement of human rights, especially education and health. The regression analysis confirmed the existence of a positive and strong correlation between economic complexity and human rights. A unit increase in ECI corresponds to a 4.6 unit increase in SPI. Lastly, the qualitative analysis showed that challenges today outnumber opportunities in number, likelihood and impact. Keywords: Human rights, Economic complexity, Development.   Abstract  La complessità economica è una teoria e una metrica economica creata da Cesar Hidalgo e Ricardo Hausmann nel 2009 che coglie, attraverso gli output di un'economia, le capacità in essa contenute e determina il suo livello di complessità rispetto ad altri Paesi. È dimostrato che la complessità economica di un Paese è positivamente correlata alle sue possibilità di crescita economica. La complessità economica guida le politiche industriali e di sviluppo di alcuni Paesi e regioni. Tuttavia, affinché la complessità economica possa essere considerata una strategia di sviluppo sostenibile con il benessere umano come obiettivo finale, è necessario indagare la sua relazione con altre aree. Questa monografia studia la relazione tra complessità economica e diritti umani, ponendosi le seguenti domande di ricerca: La complessità economica è correlata positivamente ai diritti umani? Se sì, quali sono le possibilità e gli ostacoli alla complessificazione dei Paesi? Per rispondere alle domande di ricerca, è stato utilizzato un approccio multi metodo che include uno studio di caso sullo sviluppo della Corea del Sud e uno studio quantitativo che utilizza l'analisi di regressione di dati a pannello transnazionali sull'Indice di Complessità Economica (ECI) e sull'Indice di Progresso Sociale (SPI) per più di 120 Paesi nel periodo 2010-2019. Inoltre, è stata effettuata un'analisi qualitativa delle sfide e delle opportunità che i Paesi in via di sviluppo possono avere nell'implementare una strategia di sviluppo basata sulla complessità economica,  considerando il commercio internazionale, il dominio tecnologico e il potere delle aziende, oltre a questioni macro come il cambiamento climatico, la disuguaglianza di reddito e ricchezza, le dinamiche demografiche e il multilateralismo. Lo studio di caso ha mostrato un'apparente relazione tra la strategia di sviluppo economico adottata dalla Corea del Sud e il miglioramento della situazione dei diritti umani, soprattutto in materia di educazione e salute. La regressione ha confermato l'esistenza di una forte correlazione positiva tra complessità economica e diritti umani. Un aumento unitario dell'ECI corrisponde a un aumento di 4,6 dell'SPI. Infine, l'analisi qualitativa ha mostrato che le sfide oggi superano le opportunità per numero, probabilità e impatto.

The theory of economic complexity, created in 2009 by Cesar Hidalgo and Ricardo Hausmann, captures through the outputs (products) of an economy the capabilities contained in it and determines its level of complexity with regard to other countries. Economic complexity looks at the combinations of human capabilities as drivers of innovation. Its metrics can indicate the desirability of making new products and activities or entering new sectors and industries according to their level of complexity and, combined with the principle of relatedness, it provides tools to analyse the likeliness of success in investing in different areas.  There is evidence that the economic complexity of a country is positively related to its economic growth possibilities. Indeed, some countries and regions use economic complexity theory and metrics to guide their industrial policies. Some examples are Europe’s Smart Specialization Strategy, Canada’s Superclusters Initiative and China’s special economic zones. Since it is used as a strategy applied to countries’ productive structures to achieve economic growth, it would be interesting to understand its relationship with human development and, more specifically, with the realisation of human rights and freedoms. Thus, the monography’s first research question is: is economic complexity positively correlated with human rights realisation? To answer the question, a regression analysis of the relationship between the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and the Social Progress Index (SPI) was done, covering the period from 2010 to 2019. Moreover, the relationship between economic complexity and human rights is exemplified in the case study of South Korean economic and social development, described by many scholars and policymakers as a miracle.  Given the expected influence of the international economic and political system and relations in the development efforts of countries, a second question was posed: what are the possibilities and obstacles to countries’ complexification nowadays? To answer this question, a qualitative analysis was done on the main challenges and opportunities for 
countries’ development. This analysis includes what entails implementing an economic complexity-based industrial policy and a review of key external issues that can influence it.   The thesis is structured as follows. Chapter I is dedicated to a literature review of the economic complexity theory that goes from the basic concepts and drivers to the relationship of economic complexity with economic growth, income inequality, the environment, social  6  matters such as gender equality and health outcomes, and human development. Chapter II defines the framework of the thesis by discussing the difference between human development and human rights and presenting the research questions. The chapter is also dedicated to the case study of South Korean economic development, to understand the relationship between economic complexity and human rights within this particular and unprecedented example of development in contemporary history.  In Chapter III, the first research question is answered through a quantitative study on the relationship between economic complexity and human rights realisation. It contains an introductory discussion on human rights data and associated challenges, a detailed description of the data and econometric model used and the obtained results. Finally, Chapter IV is dedicated to answering the second research question. It presents what entails adopting an economic complexity strategy and the challenges and opportunities related to the international community rules and dynamics. Specifically, international trade, technology and corporate power are addressed, as well as broader questions such as climate change, inequality, poverty and demographic shifts.                    7  Chapter I – Economic complexity from an economic theory to a development strategy 1. Economic complexity and its index The idea of economic complexity was first introduced to the scientific community by the Chilean physicist Cesar Hidalgo and the Venezuelan economist Ricardo Hausmann in 2009. They created an improved and empirically-based version of the theories of previous economists, such as Adam Smith with his idea that economic growth was related to the division of knowledge and labour (Hidalgo, 2021), and the endogenous growth theorists who, similarly, understood economic growth as the growth of knowledge (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009). The economic complexity theory was also made possible by to application of complex methods such as machine learning to the study of economic geography (Hidalgo, 2021). The theory of economic complexity is rather intuitive. Basically, it is the idea that countries’ productive structures are based on collective knowledge and that the more a country has diversified knowledge and combines it in multiple ways through different structures and organisations to produce technology-intensive and diverse goods, the more complex and wealthier the country is. Furthermore, it is possible to distinguish between more or less complex countries by looking at the diversity and non-ubiquity of the outcomes of their productive structures. Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009), for example, decided to look at the export basket of countries from which is possible to compare the diversity of products countries can make and the ubiquity of those products by looking at how many countries produce the same products (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009).  This idea is better explained with the Lego pieces analogy presented by the theory creators:  “We can create indirect measures of the capabilities available in a country by thinking of each capability as a building block or Lego piece. In this analogy, a product is equivalent to a Lego model, and a country is equivalent to a bucket of Legos. Countries will be able to make products for which they have all of the necessary capabilities, just like a child is able to produce a Lego model if the child’s bucket contains all of the necessary Lego pieces. Using this analogy the question of economic complexity is equivalent to asking whether we can infer properties such as the diversity and exclusivity of the Lego pieces inside a child’s bucket by looking only at the models that a group of children, each with a different bucket of Legos, can make. Here we show that this is possible if we interpret data connecting countries to the products they export as a bipartite network and assume that this network is the result of a larger, tripartite network, connecting countries to the capabilities they have and products to the capabilities they require (…). Hence, connections between countries and products signal the availability of capabilities in a country just like the creation of a model by a child  8  signals the availability of a specific set of Lego pieces” (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009, p. 10.570). The decision to use trade data comes from the fact that it is the most detailed and extensive dataset that captures productive activities in a standardized way1. However, there are some limitations in using trade data as a proxy for countries’ productive capacity. The first problem is that the data thus far does not include services, a sector with increasing importance in the trade balance of countries, and the second is that there are products that are produced but not exported by a country, or vice-versa. To solve part of these problems, Hidalgo and Hausmann (2014) only considered the products in which countries had a revealed comparative advantage (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2014). Other data sources such as patents by metropolitan area or technology and total payroll by industry or city are also used to measure complexity on a smaller scale with similar results (Hidalgo, 2021).  To calculate the economic complexity of countries, the authors use the method of reflections. Economic complexity then turns out to be a very useful tool because it gives a measure of countries’ complexity and their possibilities of growth – the Economic Complexity Index (ECI). ECI is a much more accurate tool to predict growth than other metrics such as human capital, competitiveness or quality of institutions and governance, explaining about 73% of the variation in the income across countries2. It shows that countries’ income levels generally change according to their level of productive knowledge. Therefore, the gap between the income level of a country and its level of complexity reflects the country’s economic growth potential34. In synthesis, economic complexity can be understood as a driver of economic growth and the ECI as a measure of it (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2014).  According to the ECI, in 2020, the first five more complex countries were Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan, South Korea and Germany, while the less complex countries were Papua New Guinea, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Angola (OEC, n.d.-a). The Observatory of  1 The country-product associations use international trade data disaggregated according to three alternative data sources and classifications: (1) the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) revision 4 at the 4-digit level; (2) the COMTRADE Harmonized System at the 4-digit level; and (3) the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the 6-digit level (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009). 2 The result controls for countries with a significant presence of natural resources as they can have a high income without being complex (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2014). 3 ECI is not about export-oriented growth, export diversification, country size or trade openness (Hidalgo, 2021; Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2014). 4 Recently with the popularisation of the economic complexity theory and methodology, other scholars published articles suggesting slight modifications (Schetter, 2019) or alternatives to the model created by Hidalgo and Hausmann (Albeaik et al., 2017; Cristelli et al., 2013, 2015; Lapatinas et al., 2019; Lo Turco & Maggioni, 2020; Sciarra et al., 2020) so it could be even more precise in capturing the complexity of countries’ productive structures and also in predicting future economic growth.   9  Economic Complexity (OEC)5 also has a Product Complexity Index (PCI) that shows that, for the year 2020, the three most complex products were metal working transfer machines, developed exposed photographic material and photo lab equipment. The less complex product ranked was cocoa beans, followed by chromium ore and tin ores6 (OEC, n.d.-b) It is possible to see that products like machines, chemicals or electronics are at the top of the PCI, while agricultural products and those related to extractive activities are at the bottom, reflecting the intensity of knowledge needed to perform the activities that give the cited outputs. Figure 1 shows the ECI of countries ranked by the OEC in 2020:  The ECI is, thus, a measure that looks at the outputs of the countries’ productive structures to infer the capacities available in those countries. It does not look at the inputs that make a country more or less knowledge-intensive but is agnostic about the nature of knowledge and how it is combined and transformed into more or less diverse and complex outputs. By applying dimensionality reduction techniques, it learns directly from the data without assuming the nature of factors (Hidalgo, 2021). Yet, as it dialogues with the principle of relatedness, ECI gives a useful direction for countries to diversify and specialize, which can lead to their economic growth and development.   5 The OEC is a website that contains data and research pieces on economic complexity - www.oec.world. 6 Considering only the countries and products with available data for 2020. Figure 1: Economic complexity index of countries in 2020. Retrieved from OEC, n.d.-a.  10  2. The principle of relatedness The principle of relatedness comes from the idea that productive or tacit knowledge, technology and skills are concentrated in space and that activities, industries and products are more or less related if they require more or less similar inputs or/and knowledge. The study of relatedness was also just recently formalized through empirical evidence. Relatedness metrics reveal path dependencies and predict a location’s probability of entering or exiting an economic activity by looking at the related activities that such a location already does (Hidalgo et al., 2018).  The first scholars to measure the relatedness of products with trade data were Hidalgo et al. in 2007. They introduced the idea of the product space, which shows the probability that a country will start exporting a product depending on the number of related products it already exports (Hidalgo et al., 2007). Similarly, to determine the relatedness of industries, research areas, technologies or occupations, scholars look at the flow of labour among industries, shared labour pools, and so on (Hidalgo et al., 2018). The work of Neffke & Henning (2013), for example, indicated that firms’ diversification choices are strongly associated with the skills and choices of the available human resources. This is, the possibility for a firm to diversify is dependent on skill-relatedness. To arrive at this conclusion, the authors used data on cross-industry labour flows of over 400 different industries in Sweden from 2004 to 2007 (Neffke & Henning, 2013).  Just like in the ECI, the inputs are imperfectly observed, so relatedness only allows us to see the correlation of activities without precisely knowing the nature of their relationship. Nevertheless, the principle of relatedness is strong, ubiquitous and robust as countries tend to deviate from it only in 7% of the cases (Hidalgo et al., 2018). As showcased in the review of Hidalgo (2021), the product space contains well-defined clusters (more connected products and peripherical areas (less connected products), the latter composed of less complex products (Hidalgo, 2021):        11                Relatedness is useful for countries not only because it identifies with fair precision how easy or difficult can it be for them to start a certain new activity in comparison to other activities, thus showing some promising pathways of industrial diversification, but also Figure 2: The product space and the categories of products with their assigned colours. Retrieved from Hidalgo (2021).  12  because it shows that they need to create mechanisms of knowledge flow among industries and territories through different policies such as promoting the mobility of people or creating industrial parks. Moreover, relatedness studies go against the intuitive thought that countries should target the most related activities as they are easier to perform and state that the optimal approach is to target relatively unrelated activities during an opportunity window (Hidalgo et al., 2018). Another “common sense” debunked by the study of relatedness is that countries need to diversify by stepping forward in their productive value chains, showing that is it actually easier for them to invest in the upstream links of their value chains7 as they have more knowledge of it. For example, it would be more efficient for a country that produces grains to invest in producing agricultural machines or biochemical inputs for the crops than in processing the grains (Hidalgo, 2021). Even with the helpful information provided by the study of relatedness, it is not easy for countries to diversify and increase the complexity of their productive structures as their current level of complexity already limits their possibilities. As Hidalgo & Hausmann (2014) put it, countries face the “chicken and egg problem”. New activities require new capabilities that are not present in the country and those capabilities are not present because there is no demand for them. It adds to the fact that the more complex knowledge is, the more it concentrates in space and the more difficult it is to be diffused (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2014).  In short, the knowledge of activities’ complexity level and possibilities of growth captured by ECI, together with the information on the relatedness of activities provided by the principle of relatedness, can usefully inform the industrial policies of countries, being a more precise than ever before guidance to specialisation and diversification that could ultimately lead to economic growth and development.  3. The drivers of economic complexity As mentioned before, economic complexity metrics do not look at the nature of complexity. Hidalgo & Hausmann (2014) said that “(…) development is the expression of the total amount of productive knowledge that is embedded in a society. But the process by which this knowledge is accumulated has a structure that we are only now starting to understand” (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2014, p. 48). However, with the popularisation of the economic  7 The upstream links of a value chain refer to the operations that are part of the manufacturing process, where the necessary basic materials for producing finished products are obtained (Downstream Operations, 2020).  13  complexity theory within the economic research field, scholars started trying to identify the drivers8 of economic complexity to have an even more detailed explanation of how economic complexity comes to be a reality. In the words of Lo Turco & Maggioni (2020): “Economic complexity, indeed, may reflect the quality of local formal and informal institutions, the variety of inputs, the advances of technology, as well as a higher human capital requirement. Uncovering the elements behind the notion of complexity allows to shed light on some of the channels underlying the nexus between complexity and growth, and would favour the development of more precise insights to guide policy makers more effectively” (Lo Turco & Maggioni, 2020, p. 2). The starting point is understanding that a complex economy's main feature is knowledge. But it refers to a particular type of knowledge that is not the symbolic knowledge learned through books but tacit knowledge, which is embedded in individuals and is, therefore, much more difficult to transfer. Moreover, individuals are not capable of accumulating large amounts of knowledge, so for a society to be collectively wiser, it needs to have several individuals specialized in specific activities, so the tacit knowledge is then distributed in coherent pieces among them. Then, to be productive, this knowledge needs to be diverse and 
rightfully combined through complex webs of interaction. Hence, complex economies have large networks of people that together have vast quantities of diverse relevant knowledge and that know how to combine and use it to make knowledge-intensive products (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2014). Considering these characteristics of knowledge and the dynamics that need to take place for economic complexity to exist, Balland et al. (2020) found out, by looking at the United States, that complex activities concentrate disproportionately in large cities and that the more complex a place is, the more urbanized it will be and vice-versa. This happens because big cities concentrate diversified human capital, institutions and organisations that create several opportunities for complex activities to happen. This finding leads to two critical considerations for policy: (1) with complexification, inequality between large cities and small cities/rural areas is likely to increase; and (2) megacities may be an important driver of development, as in the Chinese experience (Balland et al., 2020).  Naturally, the type of human capital in a location also influences its economic complexity. According to the study of Lo Turco & Maggioni (2020) on the labour content of complex products, complexity is highly intensive in STEM knowledge (Science, Technology,  8 The research pieces cited in the 'The drivers of economic complexity' subchapter and those cited in the following subchapters use different versions of the ECI, methods and controls to arrive at results. Such information is not mentioned throughout the text but can be consulted directly in each reference work.  14  Engineering and Mathematics) and in critical thinking, science and mathematics skill requirements, which means that the accumulation of this type of knowledge and skills should be encouraged in order to enhance the complexity level of industries, regions or countries (Lo Turco & Maggioni, 2020).  Looking at the demographics of complexity, Bahar et al. (2019), using a sample of 100 countries for a period of 10 years (1990-2000), showed that the birthplace diversity of the immigrant population of a country is positively correlated with its economic complexity as it contributes to the diversity of knowledge. This is the case especially for countries at intermediate levels of economic complexity and considering high-skilled immigrants (Bahar et al., 2019). Similarly, the social inclusion of LGBT strengthens innovative national capacity by fostering the accumulation of human capital skills. Moreover, the tolerance of LGBT people by a population tends to be indicative of its tolerance towards technological innovation (Vu, 2021). In addition, Nguyen (2021) found that gender equality in employment, education, health and socio-economic and political rights is greatly beneficial to economic complexity. When looking at employment, specifically, the results demonstrate that women's participation in the industry or service sectors is positively correlated with complexity. In contrast, their employment in agriculture, self-employment or vulnerable employment are negatively correlated. To arrive at such conclusions, the author used panel data9 on 119 countries from 1991 to 2017 (Nguyen, 2021). Hence, according to the available research, the most inclusive society a is, the most it enables human capital development and innovation, leading to economic complexification. The remaining and relatively recent literature on the drivers of economic complexity investigates the influence of internet usage, taxation, foreign direct investment (FDI), intellectual property rights/patents, financial development and institutional quality, among others. Not surprisingly, Lapatinas (2019) found out that internet usage is positive and statistically significant10 for complexity, suggesting that increasing access to the internet could accelerate economic sophistication (Lapatinas, 2019). Regarding taxation, Lapatinas et al.  9 “Panel data analysis refers to the statistical analysis of data sets consisting of multiple observations on each sampling unit. This could be generated by pooling time-series observations across a variety of cross-sectional units, including countries, firms, or randomly sampled individuals or households. This also encompasses longitudinal data analysis in which the primary focus is on individual histories” (Lavrakas, 2008). For example, in most of the works cited in the monograph, panel data is used to analyse the relationship between the changes in countries’ economic complexity in relation to changes in other aspects throughout the years or decades. 10 “Statistical significance is a determination that a relationship between two or more variables is caused by something other than chance” (Kenton, 2022, n.p.).  15  (2019) tried to understand what fiscal policy is better for fostering economic complexity by looking at evidence from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. They found out that economies that rely less on capital taxation than labour taxation tend to be more sophisticated and that the negative correlation of capital taxes with economic complexity is stronger for high-income countries. (Lapatinas et al., 2019). The evidence is mixed in the case of inward FDI11. The study of Javorcik et al. (2018) on Turkey’s manufacturing sector from 2006 to 2009 indicates that FDI may serve as a catalyst for the complexification of the economy, being the small and less sophisticated firms the ones to benefit the most from it. However, the positive technological/knowledge spill over effect only occurs when FDI is present in the downstream sectors12 and mostly by multinationals of industrialized countries (Javorcik et al., 2018).  Differently, by broadening the study of the correlation of FDI with economic complexity to a sample of 117 countries from 1995 to 2016, Antonietti & Franco (2021) discovered that only greenfield FDI can lead to economic complexity and only for countries with certain characteristics: above-average levels of income per capita, financial development, tertiarization and an above-average level of tertiary-educated population. For other countries, only knowledge-intensive greenfield FDI relate to economic complexity. Therefore, there is no clear correlation with inward FDI in developing countries (Antonietti & Franco, 2021). As for intellectual property rights and patents, the evidence is also mixed. A study of 52 economies done by Nguyen et al. (2020) found a positive correlation of patents with economic complexity (Nguyen et al., 2020). While Sweet & Maggio (2015), when analysing the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), found that it positively correlated with economic complexity only for countries with an already above-average level of economic development and complexity. So for developing countries, it generally has a negative correlation or, at best, an insignificant one, thus reinforcing global productive inequality (Sweet & Maggio, 2015). The study of Nguyen et al. (2020) also identified a short-run positive relationship between financial development and economic complexity, as an efficient financial market  11 Inward FDI refers to any foreign direct investment received by a location, which can be of two types: greenfield or mergers and acquisitions. The biggest difference between the two types is that while the first implies the creation of a new business, the second refers to buying or merging with an existing company (Hintošová, 2021). 12 “Downstream operations refer to the final processes in the production and sale of goods, where finished products are created and sold to consumers” (Downstream Operations, 2020, p. n.d.).  16  offers alternative funding possibilities for productive activities. But in the long run13 the relationship becomes negative because a too large financial market does not add to the sophistication or diversification of the economy (Nguyen et al., 2020).  Finally, the last cited contribution to the drivers of economic complexity is the work of Vu (2022), which approached the influence of institutional quality. With a sample of 115 countries and using the Economic Freedom of the World Index14 as a proxy of institutional quality, the author came to the conclusion that higher-quality institutions lead to higher economic complexity since well-functioning inclusive institutions would lead to human capital accumulation (better-educated population), innovative entrepreneurship and allocation of human resources in productive activities (Vu, 2022).   While it is easy to imagine that states and the institutions that compose them have a relevant impact on the productive capacity of a country, the study of the influence of institutions on economic complexity is almost inexistent and constitutes a huge gap and research opportunity within the field.  4. Economic complexity and economic growth   As briefly mentioned in the first subchapters, one of the most important contributions of the economic complexity methods is that they empirically proved a strong association between economic complexity and economic growth. Several scholars confirmed this correlation using different evidence, metrics and versions of the ECI, of which a few are briefly mentioned in this section.   Besides the basilar and already cited work of Hidalgo & Hausmann (2014), the works of Zhu & Li (2016), Stojkoski & Kocarev (2017), Gala et al. (2018) and Udeogu et al. (2021) show that economic growth is considerably related to the complexity of countries’ productive structures. Of the scholars mentioned, Gala et al. (2018) were the ones to use the broadest set of countries (147) for the largest period (1979-2011). They verify that the higher the economic complexity, the higher the probability of growth and that complexity is partly explanatory of the divergence or convergence among low- and high-income countries. A focus of their work is to show how economic complexity corroborates with the structuralist  13 A long run/long-term effect refers to a time span of decades. 14 The Economic Freedom of the World Index created by the Heritage Foundation is composed of 28 indicators classified in five areas: size of government; legal systems and security of property rights; freedom to trade internationally; access to sound money; and regulation of credit, labour and businesses (Vu, 2022).  17  economic theory15, which was very strong in Latin America during the 60s, but now with the advantage of working with evidence (Gala et al., 2018). Zhu & Li (2017) made an analysis based on 126 countries from 1995 to 2010. They investigated the correlation of economic complexity and human capital with economic growth, and the outcome was the same: complexity has a strong explanatory relation with growth. Nevertheless, they saw that human capital measured by secondary and tertiary education attainment still had a relevant role, indicating that there must be a combination of both (Zhu & Li, 2017). “Ignoring the cultivation of human capital is not conducive to the improvement of domestic production capabilities” (Zhu & Li, 2017, p. 13). The last two studies focused on reduced sets of countries. Udeogu et al. (2021) used data from 31 OECD countries covering the period 1982-2017 to test if product complexity determines long-term economic growth, and they found that complexity indeed determines growth in the long run (Udeogu et al., 2021). Equally, when studying the relationship between growth and economic complexity in 16 countries from South-Eastern and Central Europe, Stojkoski & Kocarev (2017) arrived at a similar conclusion to other works on the topic, that economic complexity is a statistically significant explanatory variable of growth in the long run, while in the short run there is no correlation (Stojkoski & Kocarev, 2017).  This growing literature linking economic complexity with economic growth clearly indicates that for countries to develop economically, they need to create and implement strategies that include and even have as a main feature the complexification of their productive structures. This relationship, however, is not so linear and simple, and the economic development of nations is also not realized only with income growth but it has to do with the distribution of this income. 5. Economic complexity and income inequality All the existing research on the relationship between economic complexity and income distribution or income inequality confirms that complexity strongly influences income inequality, positively or negatively. Interestingly, some of these works also show that other important factors influence this relationship and could moderate it.   15 “The structuralist view usually stresses that economic development is strongly linked to a radical transformation in the structure of production to suppress obstacles, bottlenecks and other rigidities of underdevelopment. Based on the hypothesis that the industrial structure affects both the rhythm and the direction of economic development, the structuralist literature highlights the importance of industrialisation as a process of structural change necessary to economic development” (Gala et al., 2018, p. 220).  18  One of the most influential studies on the relationship between economic complexity and economic inequality is the article of Hartmann et al. (2017). By using cross-country evidence (over 150 countries) from 1963 to 2008, they found that complexity negatively correlates with income inequality. This is, the more complex a country becomes, the more likely it is to decrease its level of income inequality. More specifically, one standard deviation16 in economic complexity is associated with a reduction on the Gini Index17 of 0.03 points. Another interesting contribution of this work was the development was the creation of a Product Gini Index (PGI) that associates products with levels of income inequality (Hartmann et al., 2017).   In their words, “understanding the determinants of income inequality is not simple since income inequality depends on a variety of factors, from an economy’s factor endowments, geography, institutions, and social capital, to its historical trajectories, changes in technology, and returns to capital” (Hartmann et al., 2017, p. 76). Still, the level of economic complexity of a country is not only reflective of its productive structure but also other features and dynamics, such as geographic features, human capital and institutions. Because of that, economic complexity can also partly explain income inequality (Hartmann et al., 2017).  On the other hand, Lee & Vu (2019) obtained contrary results when investigating the same relationship. Using a sample of 96 countries from 1980 to 2014, they found that economic complexity was associated with an increase in income inequality in the long term (Lee & Vu, 2020). Chu & Hoang (2020) corroborated that economic complexity is associated with higher income inequality using panel data on 88 countries from 2002 to 2017. However, they also observed that economic complexity could be associated with less income inequality if certain thresholds in education, government spending and trade openness are met (Chu & Hoang, 2020).  Other scholars also indicate that for the relationship between a country's level of economic complexity and level of income inequality to be positive or negative, there are some moderators or influencing factors to consider. For example, Fawaz & Rahnama-Moghadamm (2019), using panel data for 129 countries from 1964 to 2013, found that: (1) the average level  16 “The standard deviation is the average amount of variability in your dataset. It tells you, on average, how far each value lies from the mean. A high standard deviation means that values are generally far from the mean, while a low standard deviation indicates that values are clustered close to the mean” (Bhandari, 2022, paras 1 and 2). 17 The Gini index, or Gini coefficient, is a measure of income distribution across a population. The index ranges from 0 or 0% (perfect equality) to 1 or 100% (perfect inequality) (Hayes, 2022).  19  of income inequality of the top 10 trade partners influences a country's level of income inequality; and (2) trading with more 
economic complex countries correlates with the reduction in income inequality (Fawaz & Rahnama-Moghadamm, 2019).  Following the same line, Lee & Wang (2021) investigated if country risk could be a moderator of the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality. By employing panel data on 43 countries from 1991 to 2016, they concluded that country risk and its subdivision into areas (economy, politics, finance and others) are relevant for the complexity-inequality nexus. So economic complexity is positively associated with lower income inequality under low country risk (Lee & Wang, 2021). In synthesis, economic complexity is a good predictor and source of economic growth, and it can also contribute to lowering the average level of income inequality of a country, taking into consideration other influencing variables. Nevertheless, there are still two types of inequalities that were not addressed so far: inequalities within and among countries, where it could be easier to see the adverse effects of relatedness due to the concentration of knowledge in some urban regions and countries.  Brazil and China serve as examples to understand the relationship between complexity and income inequality within countries. Morais et al. (2021) used panel data for the 27 regions of Brazil from 2002 to 2014. Their results showed that the relationship of economic complexity with income inequality has an inverted U-shape, so as complexity increases, income inequality also increases and decreases afterwards. This relationship, however, is mediated by each region's development level, especially considering urbanisation and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Thus, the regions need to reach a development threshold to feel the benefits of economic complexity in reducing income inequality (Morais et al., 2021).  Regarding China, Gao & Zhou (2018) concluded that economic complexity negatively correlates with regional income inequality when studying firm data for 70 industries in 31 provinces from 1990 to 2015 (Gao & Zhou, 2018). However, by zooming in into the intra-regional level based on export data and income survey data, Zhu et al. (2020) found that economic complexity only contributes to the reduction of regional income inequality in urban areas, deepening the urban-rural divide existent in China as there are barriers that inhibit the flow of capital and labour between cities and rural areas. The authors pointed out that the Chinese government needs to be aware of this rural-urban divide and develop strategies to make complexity beneficial to both rural and urban populations (Zhu et al., 2020).    20  There is a similar dynamic in the case of income inequality among countries. Within regions, only a few nations are able to complexify their economies while the others lag behind, which is the case in Europe. Through data on industries and patents from 283 regions in 32 European countries for 15 years, Pinheiro et al. (2022) saw that only the already more complex places benefit from economic complexity and are able to diversify into other (even more) complex activities. The other locations are not benefited and then focus on low-complex activities, creating a spatial inequality feedback loop (Pinheiro et al., 2022).   The greatest challenge, however, is certainly for low- and middle-income countries to catch up and become economically developed, which only a few nations have been able to do so far. Countries “stuck” in the same income level for a long time are said to be in an ‘income trap’ (Felipe et al., 2012). Latin American countries are good examples of this phenomenon. They were middle-income countries long before some Asian and European countries, but while the latter afterwards were able to become high-income countries, Latin American countries remained at the same income level (Jankowska et al., 2012).  Scholars studying the income trap see the complexification of productive structures as a way for countries to develop economically and, therefore, a crucial part of the solution to the income trap (Felipe et al., 2012; Hartmann et al., 2020; Jankowska et al., 2012). But, as seen previously, achieving this goal is not as simple as it may seem. Fortunately, the work of economic complexity scholars is increasingly providing helpful, specific and practical policy guidance. Jankowska et al. (2012), for example, said that “for small and medium-sized developing countries which are dependent on external markets for driving their productive development, PDPs18 need to be guided by the appropriate temporary incentive structures, in line with factor endowments, and be coherent with other relevant complementary policy areas” (Jankowska et al., 2012, p. 43).  Pinheiro et al. (2022), by their side, said that for complexity to take place in peripherical countries of a region such as Europe or the European Union (EU), governments and other stakeholders need to pursue complexification by upgrading existing activities and diversifying at the same time as developing less complex activities and creating new jobs in these areas so to build on existing local capabilities. This is a very challenging task that requires some prior efforts, and those could be: (1) the development of local knowledge and education infrastructure; (2) the establishment of linkages with other regions; (3) the attraction of skilled migrants; (4) the establishment of new research collaborations; (5) the  18 Productive development policies.  21  attraction of external firms and; (6) the improvement institutional governance (Pinheiro et al., 2022). Finally, a very important contribution that can be used as policy guidance is the work of Hartmann et al. (2020). By comparing the experiences of countries that complexified their productive structures and became economically developed (e.g. Ireland, Singapore and South Korea) with those that got "stuck in the middle" (e.g. Brazil and South Africa), they were able to identify what was done differently between the two groups and what could be the way out for developing countries (Hartmann et al., 2020). According to the authors, the first group had smart industrial policies that enabled them to identify and use windows of opportunities in the digital and electronic sectors and promote the acquisition of endogenous skills and access to international knowledge sources. The latter kept gravitating towards simple economic activities, did not have coherent industrial policies and suffered from social fragmentation. So countries that want to develop economically have to plan this development through industrial policies that promote economic complexity, considering the principle of relatedness and identifying these windows of opportunity to enter new industries and markets at the right time (Hartmann et al., 2020). 6. The impact of economic complexity beyond the economy If economic complexity is to be taken as a development strategy or part of it, its impact on societal issues beyond economic growth and income inequality must be considered. Scholars recently started to study the correlation of complexity with environmental and social matters such as gender inequality, health and crime. The most studied subject so far is the impact of economic complexity on the environment, which is not surprising when taking into consideration that the improvement of productive structures presupposes the use of more resources and energy and that climate change today is one of the biggest challenges, if not the bigger, we as a global society have to face. When looking at economic complexity and environmental protection as goals, we could assume that it is impossible to achieve both, as they seem contradictory. However, the existing studies have shown that this relationship is not so straightforward. Romero & Gramcow (2021) demonstrated with their study, using data for 67 countries from 1976 to 2012 on greenhouse gas emissions intensity, that more complex products are associated with lower emissions and, consequently, more complex countries tend to pollute the atmosphere less (Romero & Gramkow, 2021). More specifically, “an increase of 0.1 in the economic complexity index generates a 2% decrease in next period’s emissions of kilotons of  22  CO2 per billion dollars of output” (Romero & Gramkow, 2021, p. 1). Boleti et al. (2021) arrived at similar conclusions when studying the overall environmental performance of countries in relation to their economic complexity levels. Using the Environmental Complexity Index of 88 countries from 2002 to 2012, they saw that higher complexity leads to better environmental performance. However, it also leads to lower air quality (Boleti et al., 2021). On the other side, according to the study by Dogan et al. (2019) that analysed the CO2 emissions of 55 countries from 1971 to 2014, economic complexity increased emissions in lower and higher middle-income countries while controlled emissions in high-income countries (Doğan et al., 2019). Similarly, Khezri et al. (2022) investigated the role of economic complexity in determining how renewable energies affect CO2 emissions using a sample of 29 countries from Asia and the Pacific from 2000 to 2018. They corroborated that economic complexity increases emissions as it increases the scale of production and the energy demand. Yet, at the same time, using solar and wind energy sources helps reduce emissions in countries of lower complexity (Khezri et al., 2022). Thus, complexity is negative for economically developing countries and positive for the already developed ones. To be more precise, complexity is no longer harmful to the environment after a certain threshold. Neagu (2021) gave a practical example: for carbon emissions to start decreasing, France had to reach the threshold of 1.6 ECI, Italy 1.45, Finland 1.9 and Belgium 1.4. It then validates the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), which is the idea that complexity growth will lead to an increase in environmental degradation and then a decrease when a high complexity level is achieved (Neagu, 2021). So, on one side, there is the desire and right of countries to develop and on the other, the urgent need to curb emissions and preserve the environment so as not to arrive at an irreversible situation of resource crises and environmental disasters on a global scale. As with the relationship between economic complexity and income inequality, scholars believe that economic complexity can be compatible with environmental protection if moderated by institutions and policies.  Ahmad et al. (2021), for example, investigated the impact of institutional quality19 on the relationship between economic complexity and footprint20 in 20 emerging economies from  19 It is an index created by the PRS Group which covers the bureaucratic quality, law & order, internal conflicts, ethnic tensions, demographic accountability, control of corruption, government stability, external conflicts, military in politics, religious tension, socio-economic conditions, and investment profile (Ahmad et al., 2021). 20 The Ecological Footprint is a metric of how fast we consume resources and generate waste compared to how fast nature can absorb our waste and generate resources (Ecological Footprint, n.d., n.p.).  23  1984 to 2017, and the outcome of their work was that environmental footprint is reduced when moderated by institutional quality. Moreover, they also validated the EKC hypothesis and recommended that countries combine a solid environmental protection framework with the acceleration of the complexification process for their growth to be sustainable (Ahmad et al., 2021).  Other academics expressed their concern about the negative impact of economic complexity on the environment and proposed a series of policies for growth and development to take place ecologically and sustainably. Khezri et al. (2022) provided several specific recommendations in their work, which are: regarding energy use, for more complex countries to focus on the production of renewable energy, processes optimisation and structural changes in the industry to prevent CO2 emissions; and for less complex countries that lack the capabilities to transition to renewable energy production and use, to direct their attention to supply and demand as well as industrial strategies to reduce emissions and innovate (Khezri et al., 2022) In general, they also recommend that countries start using or expanding ecological technologies such as carbon capture and utilisation and implement environmental policies such as subsidies and incentives for renewable energy infrastructure, green technology investment and carbon tax. Moreover, if considering the general interest in curbing global warming as stated in the Paris Agreement, countries with the knowledge of green technologies should consider transferring it to less complex countries (Khezri et al., 2022).  Neagu (2021) made a no less significant contribution in that sense. The scholar advised companies and industrial units to integrate energy considerations in the early stages of their product design and, again, to invest in ecological technologies. Furthermore, industries should analyse their potential impact before starting any operation and design ways of mitigating any foreseeable negative impact. Regarding governments, they should have a national commitment and a realistic plan to reduce carbon emissions that incorporate both regulatory and financial measures (Neagu, 2021). Nevertheless, shifting from current productive models to ecological ones is not simple. In the end, environmental protection is also an economic decision. In that sense, Mealy & Teytelboym (2020) observed that green products have not grown as a fraction of total trade in the last twenty years. To inform countries about their real possibilities to become complex and environmentally coherent and, therefore, provide some guidance for the creation of policies and industrial strategies toward a transition, the authors created the Green Complexity Index (GCI) and the Green Complexity Potential (GCP). The GCI gives  24  information on countries' current capabilities for producing ecological products, and the GCP shows countries' potential for complexification in ecological products (Mealy & Teytelboym, 2020). As far as the research on complexity and environmental protection arrived, researchers tend to agree that both goals can be mutually achieved if efforts are made to avoid degradation during the complexification process. However, for the offer of ecological products and the investment in greener technologies to take place, the government and the private sector need to change their approach, but the demand side and public opinion also matter. According to Lapatinas et al. (2021) research, economic complexity shapes cultural values and beliefs related to environmental protection. Hence, they suggest that countries that want to implement measures to reduce degradation should be aware of cultural barriers and find the right incentives for the policies to be successful among the population (Lapatinas et al., 2021). Now, turning the attention to the discussions on the impacts of complexity on social issues, there are, as mentioned previously, very few studies related to gender equality, health and crime. With respect to gender, scholars investigated the role of complexity on gender inequality in education and the formation of gender roles. Saâd and Ella (2019) used data from the Gender Parity Index in education and the ECI for the period 1984-2014 and concluded that economic complexity reduces gender inequalities in education, especially at the tertiary level taking into consideration the global sample (Saâd & Ella, 2019).  And Zanaj (2021) found that economic complexity is correlated with female emancipation as knowledge accumulation favours more egalitarian attitudes, while low levels of complexity are compatible with back-lashing gender roles. However, the attitudes towards gender relate only to women's position within a household. Concerning their position in the public sphere, opinions are more inclusive only in places at high levels of complexity. The study was based on the responses of 64.954 individuals from 59 different countries (Zanaj, 2021). Overall, it can be said from the exis
