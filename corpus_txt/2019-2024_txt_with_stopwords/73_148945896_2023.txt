Existing studies have explored various derivingfactors of green growth. However, none of the studies has evaluatedthe combined effect of economic complexity, trade diversification,renewable energy consumption, and environment-related taxes topromote green growth. Therefore, this study quantified the impactof these variables on achieving green growth goals for BRICTS coun-tries (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China, Turkey, and SouthAfrica) from 1995 to 2018. The study addressed the potential econo-metric issues of panel data, such as cross-section dependency, slopeheterogeneity, data nonstationary through robust testing. Cross-Sectional ARDL has been applied to investigate the long-run andshort-run association among the study variables. The findings sug-gest that economic complexity, trade diversification, renewableenergy consumption, and environment-related taxes significantlydrive green growth in BRICTS countries. However, their marginal con-tribution substantially varied. Similar results are endorsed using alter-native estimators and offer pertinent policy implications.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 14 May 2022Accepted 25 October 2022KEYWORDSGreen growth; economiccomplexity; tradediversification; renewableenergy; environment-related taxesJEL CODESQ16; Q01; B261. IntroductionIn the era of industrialization with rapid economic growth, sustainable developmentis the key agenda (Kwilinski et al., 2019). Economic growth is important for improv-ing the quality of life, reducing poverty and inequalities, and enhancing overall pros-perity (Saleem et al., 2022). However, economic growth has environmentalconsequences, such as excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global warming,waste production, environmental degradation, and biodiversity losses (Hao et al.,2021). Environmental protection has become a major concern for policymakers. DueCONTACT Wenjuan Zhao estelle_zhao81@163.com 2022 The Author(s).

Therefore, there is a need to adopt thealternative economic growth path, such as green growth, which is geared toward effi-ciently consuming economic resources, mitigating the environmental impact, andmeeting sustainable development goals (SDGs-13). The concept of green growth wasraised as an alternative perspective of economic growth by considering the potentialsocial, economic, and environmental constraints for sustainable development (Tawiahet al., 2021). According to the (OECD., 2018), ‘green growth means fostering eco-nomic growth and development while ensuring that natural assets continue to pro-vide the resources and environmental services on which our well-being relies’ Greengrowth is also known as ‘the environmentally adjusted multifactor productivitygrowth’ (Hao et al., 2021).The additional component to measure green growth other than the traditionalGDP measures is the resource consumption costs (the cost of environmental impact).The achievement of green growth goals is subject to the development and diffusionof environmental-friendly technology and products and other economic factors.Existing studies have explored various sets of factors that drive green growth. Forinstance, economic complexity is important in determining the products’ skills, know-ledge, diversity, and ubiquity needed for green growth. Similarly, trade diversificationalso enhances economic growth by exploring new markets and business opportunities(Can et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022). Renewable energy consumption is the major com-ponent of the sustainable development function. Besides this, the environment-relatedtax is the carbon-pricing strategy to control the GHGs emission and support resourcemanagement to achieve green growth (Hao et al., 2021). However, the combinedeffect of economic complexity, trade diversification, renewable energy consumption,and environment-related taxes to promote green growth has not been explored yet.Therefore, to cover the gap, this study quantified the impact of these variables onachieving green growth goals for emerging economies of BRICTS countries (Brazil,Russian Federation, India, China, Turkey, and South Africa).BRICTS countries are the unique economic bloc of emerging economies (middle-income group countries) with steady growth and are acknowledged as the fifth largestgroup in the world economy. This bloc has achieved a remarkable rise in GDP inrecent decades. Therefore, BRICTS countries are a key driver of global economicgrowth because their aggregate GDP is comparatively higher than G7 countries. Themassive production activities and high population has extensively enhanced energyconsumption. BRICTS are accountable for consuming more than 40% of the world’stotal energy consumption, leading to high carbon emissions. BRICTS countries arealso blamed for being the top GHGs emitters in the world (Caglar et al., 2022).Besides this, these countries have enhanced a considerable share in global trade(import and export merchandise goods). China is a key player in importing andexporting merchandise goods and services, followed by Russia and Brazil. However,India has also contributed to importing and exporting services (Z. Zhang et al.,2019). Emerging economies like BRICTS face multiple economic and environmentalchallenges to sustainable development. Green growth has become the strategic prior-ity of emerging economies (Mealy & Teytelboym, 2022). Green Growth Index is a2 B. WANG ET AL.‘composite index measuring a country’s performance in achieving sustainability tar-gets, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)’ (Acosta et al., 2020). Figure 1demonstrates the improvement of BRICTS countries in the green growth index from2005 to 2019. These countries fall under moderate progress (40% to 60%) towardachieving sustainable goals. According to the data (GGGI, 2021), China has shownthe highest progress in the study bloc, from 52.07 in 2005 to 58.33 in 2019. At thesame time, India remains on the same ranking as the group of Asian countriesagainst the progress for sustainable development. In comparison, South Africa is theonly country with a decline in progress from 49.96 in 2005 to 48.79 in 2019.Economic complexity is the degree of complexity that highlights and evaluates theindustrial system differences, productive structure evolution, and trade partners(Adebayo et al., 2022) to obtain green growth. It estimates the available knowledge ofthe economy and forecasts future economic growth. Economic complexity acceleratessustainable economic efficiency and expertise by improving the production process,increasing economies of scale, reducing production costs by applying the specializeddivision of labor, and providing knowledge and technology (F. Wang et al., 2021).Moreover, it is the way to transform the economy from an energy-intensive to a tech-nology-intensive economy. Therefore, one of the important measuring tools of eco-nomic growth or the country’s productive capacity is the economic complexity index(ECI). The ECI has first introduced by (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009) to measure theexport capabilities required for sustainable economic growth. This index determinesthe products’ skills, knowledge, diversity, and ubiquity. It states that economicallygrown and developed countries have a high ranking of ECI due to complex anddiversified export products (Caglar et al., 2022). Figure 2 shows the ECI for BRICTScountries. Among all these countries, the highest index value has been obtained byChina, which exhibits the strong, productive capabilities of the country with a com-plex export portfolio. At the same time, turkey and India illustrate steady growth fora few decades. While for South Africa, a significant decline has been observedsince 2014.Similarly, another important factor highly influences green economic growth istrade diversification. Existing studies have proven that trade plays a vital role in eco-nomic sustainability (Can et al., 2021). Trade with high export portfolio boostsFigure 1. Green growth Index – comparison of 2005 and 2019 index values of BRICTS countries.Source: https://greengrowthindex.gggi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2020-Green-Growth-Index.pdfECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 3economic growth. It upsurges the per capita GDP, reduces poverty and unemploy-ment, and supports the well-being of society. However, at the same time, carbon-intense merchandise trading and manufacturing enhance environmental degradation(Jiang et al., 2022) and creates hurdles to achieving green growth. Therefore, it hasbeen suggested by World Bank and International Monitoring Fund (IMF) to divertthe trade portfolio. Trade diversification (TRD) is ‘the process by which a business,nation, or other economic entity offers a range of products or services instead of spe-cializing in just one’. TRD has various advantages. For instance, it prevents the econ-omy and entrepreneurs from global trade shocks and unforeseen unfavorablecircumstances (Song et al., 2021). It provides more business opportunities by explor-ing new markets (Can et al., 2021). This study uses trade diversification as the com-bined proxy of import and export diversification. The TRD is the compositionalchange in the import and export basket where the export specialization and concen-tration have reduced, and the number of different products has increased anddecreased the dependency risk on the specialized products (Saleem et al., 2022). Atthe same time, import diversification promotes spending on distinct exporters.Countries with high-tech imports enhance economic growth (Mania & Rieber, 2019).However, some studies have highlighted the inverse U-shaped relationship betweenexport diversification and green growth based on the threshold level of economicgrowth (Munir & Javed, 2018). Trade diversification has been measured through thetrade diversification index, which ‘signals whether the structure of exports by-productof a given country or group of countries differs from the structure of the product ofthe world’. Figure 3 demonstrates the TRD index values for BRICTS countries.It is widely known that energy consumption is the primary contributor to eco-nomic growth; however, for sustainable economic growth, the role of renewableenergy (RENR) is inevitable. Many studies (Sohag et al., 2021; Usman et al., 2021; W.Zhang et al., 2022; Y. Wang et al., 2020) have suggested RENR as a substitute forFigure 2. Economic Complexity Index ranking of BRICTS Countries.Source: Country Rankings (ECI) j OEC - The Observatory of Economic Complexity https://oec.world/en/rankings/eci/hs6/hs964 B. WANG ET AL.fossil fuels. Therefore, the consumption of renewable energy (RENE) is conducive toachieving green growth targets. These resources are cost-effective and more efficientwith green innovation (Chen et al., 2021; J. Hu et al., 2022), reduce externalities, andbecome a driving force for green growth and economic prosperity (Usman et al.,2021). Similarly, for the sustainable development goal (green growth) , the mostimportant objective is determining the routes toward economic growth without pay-ing environmental costs. Therefore, governments and policymakers are taking seriousinitiatives to control environmental degradation due to economic growth. Theyimposed carbon pricing in the form of taxes as the effective policy instrument on theconsumption of fossil fuels due to their high carbon intensity. These taxes are calledenvironment-related taxes. Numerous studies are agreed on implementing the ERT topromote RENR consumption to reduce carbon intensity and accelerate green growth(Ahmad et al., 2021; Dogan et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2019; Klymenko, 2019; Spinesi,2022) Also, to take the maximum benefits and to promote the consumption ofrenewable energy these environment-related taxes used as the subsidies to enhancegreen growth (Hao et al., 2021).The most critical part of the research paper is the selection of appropriate method-ology to obtain reliable outcomes. Following the existing studies (Hao et al., 2021;Tao et al., 2021), this study applied the advanced panel data estimator of ‘cross-sec-tionally augmented autoregressive distributed lags CS-ARDL’ to evaluate the impactof economic complexity, trade diversification, renewable energy consumption andenvironment-related taxes on green growth of BRICTS countries from 19950to 2018.The study prefers the CS-ARDL analysis estimator to avoid biased results by address-ing all the econometric issues which may manipulate the original outcomes. As theprerequisite to running CS-ARDL, this study has applied Pesaran (2015) test forcross-section dependency, Pesaran (2007) and Bai & Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009) testFigure 3. International Trade Diversification Index of BRICTST countries.Source: https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/TableViewer/dimView.aspxECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 5for the unit root of variables data series, while Pesaran and Yamagata (2008) testused to determine the slope heterogeneity. Consequently, to confirm the cointegrationamong variables (Westerlund & Edgerton, 2008) and (Banerjee & Carrion-I-Silvestre,2017) has applied. After having the short-run and long-run estimates to disclose thevariable relationship, the study employed the ‘Augmented Mean Group’ (AGM) and‘Common Correlated Effect Mean Group’ (CCEMG) to endorse the estimation. Thestudy’s findings revealed that all the independent variables such as economic com-plexity, trade diversification, renewable energy consumption and environment relatedtaxed significantly contribute to promote the green growth in the BRICTS countries.The rest of the research is constituted as follows: Section two discusses the empir-ical evidence from the existing literature for each independent variable, such as eco-nomic complexity, trade diversification, renewable energy, and environment-relatedtaxes relationship with green growth. Subsequently, the third section of the method-ology provides the theoretical background of the association among study variables.In addition, this section also shares the data summary and its sources and suggests 
asuitable methodology for the analysis. Section four gives a detailed discussion of thetest results applied in the analysis; the last section of the conclusion summarizes thestudy and suggests some policy recommendations to achieve green growth.2. Literature review2.1. Economic complexity and green growthIn recent years various studies have used economic complexity as the major strategyto promote social, economic, and environmentally sustainable growth. Regarding eco-nomic sustainability, this study reviews the existing studies to investigate the influ-ence of economic complexity on green growth. Economic complexity is the country’sproductive capabilities and competitive advantages measured by the ECI (EconomicComplexity Index)(Hausmann et al., 2014). The economic Complexity Index ranksthe countries based on their export portfolio similarities. The high index value of ECIillustrates that the country has high economic growth, expertise, and efficiency, andthe export basket is composed of technologically sophisticated products. In contrast,the low level of ECI shows that the countries’ economic growth is not considerable,and the greenhouse gas emission is high due to the export of technologicallyunsophisticated products (Mealy & Teytelboym, 2022). The existing literature on therelationship between ECI and green growth is scant. However, numerous studies havediscussed the effect of ECI on other major components of economic development.Such as (Sepehrdoust et al., 2022) highlight income inequalities as a critical factor ofeconomic growth and investigate the economic complexity role in income inequalityin developing countries from 2000 to 2019. They found that economic complexityincreases income inequality and promotes economic growth.Some studies discuss the EC’s influence on regional economic growth. Forinstance, (F. Wang et al., 2021) refer to economic complexity as the economic capa-bilities in resource allocation, knowledge application, and industrial chain expansion.While evaluating the impact of EC on the green development efficiency of variousprovinces of China, they suggested that ECI has positively associated with the green6 B. WANG ET AL.development of China provinces. It has been witnessed in two ways; for instance, ECdirectly accelerates green economic growth. Similarly, improving the human capitaland innovation levels is mediating in improving the ECI impact on green economicdevelopment efficiency. Likewise, a study by (Gao & Zhou, 2018) assessed the role ofthe provisional economic complexity of china by accommodating the firm-based dataof 25 years. They found that the ECI significantly correlated with economic develop-ment and income inequalities. Moving toward the green economy (Mealy &Teytelboym, 2022) measures economic complexity’s productive capabilities to obtaingreen economic growth. They assign ranks to the countries based on the complexgreen product exports. The study explored that the high economic complexity pro-vides a strong path to green growth by reducing carbon emissions and transformingtraditional industrialization toward green industrialization. In addition, (Fraccasciaet al., 2018) discussed the economic complexity regarding green products productionand comparative capabilities to improve the exports of green products for the sampleof 41 countries from 2005 to 2013. Similarly, (Dordmond et al., 2021) determined therelationship between economic complexity and green job creation for 27 states ofBrazil and found that economic complexity promotes green employment.2.2. Trade diversification and green growthTrade plays a vital role in promoting economic growth. There are a plethora of stud-ies discussing the volume-based trade nexus with economic growth. However, thelink between compositions-based trade in trade diversification and green growth hasnot been significantly explored. For instance, few studies (Saleem et al., 2022) haveinvestigated export diversification’s impact on attaining green growth targets inSAARC ‘The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation’ countries from 2000to 2019. They found that export diversification has an inverse and insignificant rela-tionship with green growth. It means that the SAARC country’s exports are concen-trated; therefore, these countries cannot reap the benefits of export diversification andenergy efficiency production techniques to improve green growth. Other studies havelinked trade diversification (proxy of export and import diversification) with differentforms of economic development, such as (Charles et al., 2018) determined the exportdiversification linkage with the economic growth of Nigeria from 1981. Their studyexplored that export diversification enhances economic growth in Nigeria’s early yearsof analysis. Whereas in the last period, the upsurge in economic growth is due to theoil export only, while the export diversification significantly declines the economicgrowth due to the weak institutional quality. Therefore, the product specializationstrategy gives better output than the export diversification.Likewise, (Carrasco & Tovar-Garcıa, 2021) examines the accumulated role of threeimportant factors, export diversification, import composition, and export compos-ition, on trade-based economic growth. The outcome of their study revealed theinsignificant influence of export diversification and export composition on the eco-nomic growth of 19 developing countries. In contrast, the import composition signifi-cantly enhances the economic growth due to the high share of high-tech imports(Mania & Rieber, 2019) highlight the productive capabilities in the exportECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 7diversification to attain sustainable economic growth targets by applying the advancedpanel data estimations on the three samples of developing countries from LatinAmerica, Sub-Sahara Africa, and Asia from 1995 to 2015. They discovered that exportdiversification with technology spillover accelerates economic growth with the help oftechnology spillover. They argue that the quality of the export diversification mattersconcerning the country’s structural and productive capacity. The emerging marketsand developing countries (Trinh & Thuy, 2021) evaluated the association betweenexport diversification and economic growth. They found that at or above the certainregression threshold, the export diversification amplifies the economic growth, whilebelow the threshold level, the impact of export diversification becomes insignificanton the economic growth of sample emerging markets and developing countries.In contrast, below a certain level of economic. Similar outcomes have already beenexplored by (Munir & Javed, 2018), who investigated the impact of export diversifica-tion (vertical and horizontal) on economic growth in four countries in South Asia.Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sir Lanka. The outcome of their study shows theinverse U-shaped relationship between these variables, which means that in the initialyears of economic development, export diversification boots the economic growth.However, after some threshold level, the export diversification influence becomesinsignificant while the export specialization enhances sustainable economic growth.2.3. Renewable energy and green growthThe attainment of green growth targets is highly reliant on energy resource consump-tion in the green total factor productivity. However, high consumption of fossil fuelsapricate production and boosts the economy, consequently increasing carbon inten-sity. Various studies have highlighted the key conduits to control carbon emissions.Renewable energy consumption is an extensively reported solution to reduce carbonintensity and obtain sustainable economic growth. The nexus analysis between renew-able energy and green growth (economic growth) has obtained two different conclu-sions. One group of the study conclude that as a substitute for fossil fuels, theconsumption of renewable energy (RENE) is conducive to achieving green growthtargets. For instance (W. Zhang et al., 2022) investigated the impact of RENE on thesustainable economic growth of 34 countries for the period from 2007 to 2017. TheRENE accelerates sustainable economic growth as an alternative energy source byimproving product quality and energy efficiency. However, the enhanced economicgrowth is subject to a certain threshold limit of RENE. Likewise, (Sohag et al., 2021)also affirm the positive association between RENE and green growth (GGR) inOECD countries. They employ the CS-ARDL method and found that RENE’s bio-mass or non-biomass types boost GGR. They consider it an important means ofenergy conversation to achieve sustainable economic development.In addition, (Usman et al., 2021) selected 15 top GHGs emitting countries to studythe impact of renewable energy on ecological footprint and economic growth. Theyfound RENE highly effective in boosting economic growth in the study period from1990 to 2017. Besides this, (Y. Wang et al., 2020) define the RENE as a crucial stra-tegic step toward achieving the regional economic sustainability of China. Similarly,8 B. WANG ET AL.(Tawiah et al., 2021) investigate various determinants to achieve the sustainable devel-opment goal of 2030 set by 123 countries categorized as developing and developed.RENE’s energy-related factor was found to positively impact green growth along withother constructive factors. On the other hand, another group of studies revealed aninsignificant association between RENE and GGR. For instance, A study on top oil-producing countries of Africa by (_Inal et al., 2022) tested the role of RENE on theeconomic growth of the sample countries by applying the bootstrap panel cointegra-tion test. The analysis concludes that the RENE do not facilitate economic growthdue to the underutilization of their potential consumption of RENE. For E7 countries(Aydogan & Vardar, 2020) found that RENE has a negative impact on the real GDPfrom 1990 to 2014. They argue that implementing RENE has to bear some economiccost; therefore, consumption of RENE slows economic growth in emerging econo-mies. These results endorsed the findings of (Qi & Li, 2017), who argue that theRENE has a negative impact on economic growth for EU countries because the EUcountries belong to the high subsidy group of economies whose threshold regime isnot appropriate for RENE.2.4. Environment-related taxes and green growthExisting literature has several studies highlighting the role of environment-relatedtaxes in mitigating carbon emissions, while the correlation between environment-related taxes and economic growth has not drawn much attention. According torecent studies (Tao et al., 2021), environment-related taxes theory suggests that theERT strategy discourages the consumption of carbon-intensive energy resources forproduction activities. Therefore, the economy has to withdraw from the steadygrowth, whereas some studies suggest a contradictory relation between ERT andGGR. Supporting the positive influence (Ahmad et al., 2021) compare two countries,China and India, for the imposition and collection of ERT to retain sustainable eco-nomic growth. They posit that ERT significantly constructive sustainable economicgrowth in both countries. A recent study by (Spinesi, 2022) studies the correlation ofERT on income inequality, economic growth, and human capital for the US econ-omy. They found that the ERT in terms of carbon pricing is more effective andenhances income inequalities due to an improved per capita growth rate. Thus, ERTboosts sustainable economic growth in the R&D-driven growth model.In addition, (Fan et al., 2019) analyzed the environmental taxes’ role in greendevelopment. The study used the new dynamic system of four dimensions for China.They explore that the imposition of environmental taxes enhances government con-trol to reduce carbon intensity. Moreover, ERT also helps the government adoptadvanced technology and create consumer awareness for better resource management.Hence the ERT plays a constructive role in attaining economic growth. (Hao et al.,2021) use the sample of G7 countries to evaluate the environment-related multifactoreconomic growth and confirm the carbon curtail role of renewable energy in support-ing green growth. Similarly, (Klymenko, 2019) conducted a study to confirm the roleof environmental taxes as a good policy instrument to obtain green growth in the EUand Ukraine. Since sustainable economic growth cannot be obtained withoutECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 9incorporating the environmental issue, the implementation of ERT protects the envir-onment. It encourages a green economy by controlling the excessive consumption ofcarbon-intensive energy resources and producing dirty goods. (Dogan et al., 2022)investigate the moderating impact of ERT on RENE and natural resources rent. Theyexplore that the increase in ERT promotes green production and innovation toachieve sustainable environmental and economic goals from 1994 to 2014 in G7countries (Sun & Razzaq, 2022; Zhuang et al. 2021).3. Methodology3.1. Data SummaryThe prime objective of the study is to investigate the effect of economic complexity(ECOM), trade diversification (TDV), renewable energy (RENE), and environment-related taxes (ERT) on green growth (GGR) of BRICTS countries. BRICTS countriesare the economic bloc of emerging countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, China,Turkey, and South Africa. The study span covers the period from 1995 to 2019 as perdata availability. The dependent variable green growth refers to the green total factorproductivity, the multifactor economic growth, after adjusting the environmentalissues. While economic complexity refers to the economic complexity index, it is aproductive capability measuring tool for large economies. Another indicator used todescribe trade diversification is the international trade diversification index con-structed by taking the weighted average of merchandise diversified export and import.The details of the data, such as its source and definition, has explained in Table 1.3.2. Empirical model and theoretical frameworkBased on the detailed description of the variables given in table 1, the standardapproach (Copeland & Taylor, 2004) regarding trade growth and environment andthe theoretical linkage discussed by (Mealy & Teytelboym, 2022) for economic com-plexity (Saleem et al., 2022) for trade diversification and (Hao et al., 2021) for envir-onment-related taxes with green growth (green total factor productivity).

presents as the error term of the regression model.Emerging economies like BRICTS face multiple economic and environmental chal-lenges to sustainable development. Due to the frequent economic transformations,the structural growth toward sustainability is no longer effective for these countries(Rubbo et al., 2021). Therefore, they need to adopt the alternative economic growthpath, such as green growth, which is geared toward efficiently consuming economicresources, mitigating the environmental impact, and meeting sustainable developmentgoals (SDGs-13). Green growth has become the strategic priority of emerging econo-mies, focusing on raising the global trade in the environmental goods related torenewable energy, water waste management, and recycling systems (Mealy &Teytelboym, 2022). Economic complexity index is a common tool for economicgrowth or the country’s productive capacity. This index determines the skills, know-ledge, diversity, and ubiquity of the products. It states that economically grown anddeveloped countries have a high ranking of ECI due to complex and diversifiedexports products (Caglar et al., 2022). Economic complexity accelerates sustainableeconomic efficiency by improving the production process, increasing economies ofscale, reducing production costs by applying the specialized division of labour, andproviding knowledge and technology (F. Wang et al., 2021). Therefore, the expectedoutcome of the nexus between economic complexity and green growth is posi-tive aECOM ¼ GGRECOM > 0:The bloc of BRICTS countries is specifically a merchandise export-based bloc oftrade partners. Among them, China has the highest merchandise trade. This bloc hassignificantly extended the export basket in terms of diversified products in the lasttwo decades to mitigate the impact of trade fluctuations and sudden trade shocks(Carrasco & Tovar-Garcıa, 2021). Besides this, trade diversification helps explore newmarkets and opportunities to strengthen economic growth (Can et al., 2021). Thetrade basket with eco-friendly products enhances sustainable economic andECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 11environmental growth (G. Hu et al., 2020), whereas the trade diversification portfoliowith energy-intensive products may lead to environmental degradation and not sup-port green growth. Therefore, based on the composition of the trade products, theexpected outcome of the nexus between trade diversification and green growth can bepositive aTDV ¼ GGRTDV > 0 and negative aTDV ¼ GGRTDV < 0:Global policymakers have a pivotal objective to obtain green growth. The steadyeconomic growth required high energy consumption, and this perpetual demand forenergy leads to the high consumption of fossil fuels and causes serious damage to theenvironment. Renewable energy consumption is the best alternative to control thesedamages. Renewable energy sources condensed the dependency on imported fossilfuels, thus mitigating the risk of price volatility of the imported non-nonrenewableenergy resources and stabilizing the economy (Hao et al., 2021). Moreover, long-runeconomic and environmental sustainability is also significantly reliant on cost-effect-ive renewable energy resources, conserving energy, and reducing carbon emissions(Dogan et al., 2022). Thus, the expected association between renewable energy andgreen growth is positive aRENE ¼ GGRRENE > 0 . Similarly, to control the environmentalpollution along with the sustainable economic growth government impose taxes onthe consumption of fossil fuels due to their high carbon intensity. These taxes arecalled environment related taxes. Also, to take the maximum benefits and to promotethe consumption of renewable energy these environment related taxes used as thesubsidies to enhance green growth (Hao et al., 2021). Therefore, the expected value ofthe coefficient to describe the nexus between environmental taxes and green growthis positive aERT ¼ GGRERT > 0:3.3. Econometric strategiesIt is crucial to select the right methodology for panel data analysis to obtain reliable andconsistent outcomes and to provide better policy recommendations. Panel data analysishas some econometric challenges. It is extensively revolving around the issues of CR-S-DP (‘cross-section dependency’), non-stationarity (‘Unit root’), S-CORR (‘serial correl-ation’), ST-BRK (‘Structural break’), and S-HTR (‘Slope heterogeneity’). CR-S-DPdepends on cross-contrary units in high correlation (Tao et al., 2021). This interconnec-tion of countries is attributed to the spillover effects of unobserved common factors(also known as economic or financial shocks or events due to their downturns, com-modity prices, or stock indices volatility). For instance, the intensity of the global finan-cial crisis in 2008 varies for each country, and its cross-country impact cannot beignored. Thus, it has been assumed that the first generation’s estimation techniques areunreliable because they do not address the issue of cross-country dependency. Thisstudy examines the CR-S-DP existence in the panel data by applying the (Pesaran, 2015)test. The null hypothesis of this test supports the inexistence of CR-S-DP. Subsequently,the next step to selecting the panel unit root test is important to get non-fictitious resultsand highly based on the CR-S-DP test outcome.The affirmation of the CR-S-DP convergence motivates the study to select theappropriate panel unit root test. Although the first generation unit root tests of Imet al. (2003b), and Lluıs Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2005) highlight the S-HTR and ST-12 B. WANG ET AL.BRK failed to address the issue of CR-S-DP. In contrast, the second generation testsof Pesaran (2006) consider CR-S-DP but cannot determine the ST-BRK. Therefore,the Bai & Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009) and Pesaran (2007) tests of unit root from third-generation were found to be a more appropriate panel unit root test that accommo-dates both CR-S-DP issues and ST-BRK of panel data. The null hypothesis of thesetests assumes that the data is not stationary. Afterward, to identify another flaw ofslope homogeneity in the panel data, the study applied the test of Pesaran andYamagata (2008) to examine the S-HTR with the null hypothesis of ‘homogenousslope parameters’. Upon confirmation of the unique integration order of the paneldata series, the study employed the (Westerlund & Edgerton, 2008) and (Banerjee &Carrion-I-Silvestre, 2017) tests of cointegration. The reason to select these two tests isthat the first one tackle all the discussed econometric issue related to panel data,whereas the second one more precisely explains the strength of cross-sec-tional dependency.In the presence of CR-S-DP and S-HTR, the use of ordinary least square (OLS)does not remain pertinent to estimating the long-run coefficient. Hence, the studyassumes that the ‘cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lags’ (CS-ARDL) is appropriate for estimating the long-run associations among variables (Aliet al., 2021; Çoban & Topcu, 2013). CS-ARDL is the advanced panel data estimateswhich provide reliable estimates for long-run and short-run estimates by handling theCR-S-DP and S-HTR to suggest a common policy framework for green growth (Haoet al., 2021). The CS-ARDL model has been constructed as under:GGRit ¼Xpui¼0hitGGRit1 þXpvi¼0xitVit1 þ lit (iii)Where GGR is a dependent variable refer as green growth, while the independentvariables are denoted with V, such as economic complexity (ECOM), trade diversity(TDV), renewable energy (RENE), and environment-related taxes (ERT). Equation(iii) does not address the CR-S-DP; therefore, there is a high probability that the out-comes become erroneous. Chudik & Pesaran (2015) suggested that taking the cross-section average of variables’ impact on CR-S-DP has neutralized. Thus, equation (iii)is extended into equation (iv), where the cross-section average of each independentvariable has been appliedGGRit ¼Xpui¼0hitGGRit1 þXpvi¼0xitVit1 þXpwi¼0uiWt1 lit (iv)WhereWt1 ¼ ðGGRit1,Vit1ÞThe average value of the dependent variable GGRit1 and all independent variablesVit1 are presents as Wt1: Besides this, equation (iv) pu, pv, and pw illustrate thevariable lags value. In the CS-ARDL estimation approach, the long-run estimatedECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 13values are measured through the value of short-run estimations. The long-run param-eter estimations and the mean group estimator are presented as under:b̂CDARDL, i ¼PpvI¼0x̂Ii1 ¼ RI¼0 hI, t (v)The estimator for the mean group (MG) is as under:b̂MG ¼1NXNi¼1b̂i (vi)Whereas the coefficient of the short-run relationship is as follows:DGGRit ¼ di½GGRit1  aiVit1 Xpu1i¼ihitDIGGRit1þXpvi¼0xitDIVit1 þXpwi¼0uiWt1 lit(vii)WhereDI ¼ t  ðt  1Þk̂i ¼  ð1Xpui¼0ĥitÞ (viii)b̂i ¼Ppvi¼0x̂itk̂i(ix)b̂MG ¼1NXNi¼1b̂i (x)The value of the error correction model (ECM) should be significant, and negativevaries from negative 1 to zero, which confirms the stability of the model and itsadjustment toward the long-run adjustment. The econometric strategy of this studyincorporates two tests of the ‘Augmented Mean Group’ (AGM) estimator and‘Common Correlated Effect Mean Group’ (CCEMG) suggested by (Eberhardt & Teal,2010) and (Pesaran, 2006), respectively, to check the robustness of CS-ARDL.4. Analysis and discussionAs discussed earlier, to avoid erroneous results of the study, it is essential to considerthe issue of CR-S-DP. From Table 2, the outcomes of the Pesaran (2015) cross-14 B. WANG ET AL.sectional dependency test show the significant value of all the variables such as greengrowth, economic complexity, trade diversification, renewable energy, and environ-mental-related taxes. Thus, the null hypothesis of ‘no cross-sectional dependency’ hasbeen rejected by all and confirms the CR-S-DP in all panel data variablesLikewise, the CR-S-DP, the slope heterogeneity(S-HTR), is also a crucial issue thatneeds to be addressed to obtain reliable outcomes for the study. To serve the object,the (Pesaran & Yamagata, 2008) test results illustrated in Table 3 show that the nullhypothesis has been rejected at a 1% level of significance which assumes the ‘slopehomogeneity’ in the panel data. Hence, the high slope weight dispersion or modelslope homogeneity has been affirmed.Based on the strong evidence of CR-S-DP and S-HTR, it has been discovered thatthe BRICTS countries are interrelated and reliant on each other. Therefore, the studyused the unit root tests of Pesaran (2007) and Bai & Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009). Theoutcome of these tests in Table 4 revealed that the null hypothesis of ‘unit root pre-sent’ has been significantly rejected by Pesaran (2007) at the level. Whereas, underBai & Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009) panel unit root test, the null hypothesis of ‘unit rootpresent’ has significantly rejected at first difference.To determine the long-run association among dependent and independent varia-bles such as green growth, economic complexity, trade diversification, renewableenergy, and environmental-related taxes, the two cointegration tests of Westerlundand Edgerton (2008) and Banerjee & Carrion-I-Silvestre (2017) are applied. Tables 5and 6 illustrate the outcomes of these two tests. According to the results ofWesterlund and Edgerton (2008), the null hypothesis of ‘no cointegration’ has beenrejected at No break, Mean shift, and regime shift at a 1% significance level andendorses the long-run association between study variables.Correspondingly, the long-run correlation between green growth, economic com-plexity, trade diversification, renewable energy, and environmental-related taxes hasalso been endorsed by Banerjee & Carrion-I-Silvestre (2017) for the individual mem-bers and a full sample of BRICTS countries.The outcomes of the above two tests confirm the existence of long-run associationamong variables and motivate the study to move toward the main analysis strategy ofTable 2.

Table 7 presents thelong-run coefficient of the variables, which illustrates that the independent variablessuch as economic complexity, trade diversification, renewable energy, and environ-mental taxes have a positive and significant influence on green growth in the longrun for BRICTS countries. The positive association of economic complexity withgreen growth has explained that economic complexity is the ability of the specificeconomy to efficiently allocate its resources, bring knowledge and technology toenhance production capabilities (Zhuang et al., 2021), and diversify the products. ECIhas increased the green growth efficiency of the country. These findings are consist-ent with the study of (F. Wang et al., 2021), who state that the increase in economiccomplexity plays a major role in enhancing green growth.Table 4.

WANG ET AL.Likewise, the CS-ARDL long-run estimates for trade diversification show its posi-tive impact on green growth at a 5% significance level because trade diversificationchanges the composition of the traded products and provides vast opportunities fortrading. It mitigates the trade risk and impact of price shocks by expanding the tradeportfolio. Thus, stabilizing the revenue and promoting the trade of eco-friendly goodsand services to enhance green growth. The outcome illustrates that the nexus of tradediversification and green growth is in line with the study results (Can et al., 2021;Carrasco & Tovar-Garcıa, 2021). Similarly, the long-run positive association betweenrenewable energy and green growth exhibit that in the long run, renewable energyconsumption in BRICTS countries enhances green growth by being cost-effective,energy-conservative, emission-reducer energy sources. The finding of the CS-ARDLestimate is similar to the discoveries of (Alper & Oguz, 2016; _Inal et al., 2022; Tawiahet al., 2021). In addition, the environment-related tax also shows that the increase intax level aid green growth and discourages fossil fuel consumption from obtainingenvironmental and economic sustainability in the long run for BRICTS countries.The findings are consistent with the study outcomes of (Hao et al., 2021; Kwilinskiet al., 2019), who suggested that environment-related 
taxes control carbon-intensiveenergy resource consumption and promote renewable energy resources for produc-tion; therefore, economic stability has retained, and green growth encouraged.The short-run estimates of CS-ARDL are also illustrated in Table 7, demonstratingthat all the independent variables, such as economic complexity, trade diversification,RENE, and ERT, positively correlate with the dependent variable of GGR for BRICTScountries. These results endorse the long-run results regarding the nature of variablesassociation. However, the economic complexity significance level has varied. Thepositive association between economic complexity and green growth is significant at a10% level of significance in the short-run. Thus, it has been confirmed that all theTable 8.

In addition, the coefficient value of the ‘error correction model’ ECM issignificantly negative, which affirms the stability and reliability of the economicmodel to return toward equilibrium.In addition, for the robustness check, the study applied the ‘Augmented MeanGroup’ (AGM) and ‘Common Correlated Effect Mean Group’ (CCEMG) introduced by(Eberhardt & Teal, 2010) and (Pesaran, 2006), respectively. From Table 8, the estimatesof AGM and CCEMG have corroborated the association among variables derived fromthe CS-ARDL test. For instance, the economic complexity, trade diversification, renew-able energy, and environment-related taxes enhance green growth in BRICTS countries.5. Conclusion and policy recommendationsSustainable economic growth is the primary concern of economies and internationalorganizations for the well-being of humanity. Green growth is the most appropriatepath with a comprehensive and integrated economic approach that ensures the poten-tial economic deliverables of the natural capital on a sustainable basis. Existing studieshave explored various factors that drive green growth; however, as per our know-ledge, not a single study has been carried out to explore economic complexity, tradediversification, and environment-related taxes as the core driver of achieving greengrowth targets emerging economies like BRICTS countries. This study took the initia-tive to determine the impact of economic complexity, trade diversification, and envir-onment-related taxes on the green growth of BRICTS countries from 1995 to 2018.Emerging economies like BRICTS face multiple economic and environmental chal-lenges to sustainable development. Since frequent economic transformations occur,the structural growth toward sustainability is no longer effective in these countries.Therefore, the suggested alternative economic growth path is green growth, whichfosters the efficient consumption of economic capital, mitigating the environmentalimpact, and meeting sustainable development goals (SDGs-13).The study has employed various tests to address the panel data econometric issuesof ‘cross-section dependency, slope heterogeneity, structural breaks, serial correlation’.The stationarity of the panel data series has obtained at first difference under the testof Bai & Carrion-I-Silvestre (2009), while Pesaran (2007) suggests the integration atthe level. The mixed integration order and the affirmation of cointegration amongvariables have motivated the study to implement the CS-ARDL test. The CS-ARDLestimations have estimated the long-run and short-run estimates to investigate thereal association between economic complexity, trade diversification, environment-related taxes, and green growth. The finding of the CS-ARDL suggests that in thelong-run and short-run, all the study variable have a constructive impact on greengrowth. The study has measured the green growth of these countries in terms of theeconomic complexity index, which determines the skills, knowledge, diversity, andubiquity of the product. The positive association of ECI shows the increase in ECIboost the economic sustainability with more complex and diversified export productsin these countries. Similarly, the extended portfolio of trade diversification acceleratesthe green growth and neutralize the carbon impact of high economic growth.18 B. WANG ET AL.Additionally, the renewable energy and environment related taxes are work as usefulstrategy to promote green growth in BRICTS countries, these results were affirmedby the ‘Augmented Mean Group’ (AGM) and ‘Common Correlated Effect MeanGroup’ (CCEMG) test for robustness check.After determining the positive association between economic complexity, tradediversification, renewable energy, and environment-related taxes, this paper has pro-posed the following policy recommendation to promote green growth in BRICTScountries. Economic complexity indicates the diversification of industrialized exports,production capabilities, and the country’s competitiveness. Therefore, this economicbloc needs to significantly emphasize the economic complexity and the diversificationof the industries by introducing advanced technology and knowledge-based industrialpractices. Moreover, this transformation toward the technology and knowledge-basedproductive structure contributes to attaining green growth and carbon neutrality tar-gets and provides the comparative advantage to support regional competitiveness.Countries like South Africa that witnessed a sharp decline in the ECI are narrowlyattentive to their productive capabilities; therefore, these countries need to focusmore on resource management to develop their productive capacities to align withfuture green growth. The BRICTS countries’ bloc trade is based on energy-intensiveproducts (cement, iron, oil refineries, and heavy engineering). It has been suggestedthat to achieve sustainable economic and environmental goals; they should invest inrenewable energy resources to meet the energy demand. The government shouldencourage investment in renewable energy projects by offering grants, subsidies,loans, and tax holidays. However, they should implement energy mix strategies untilthe transformation from non-renewable to renewable energy. Moreover, by wideningthe trade portfolio in export and import diversification, they should extend the num-ber of distinct products and categorize them based on their demand and environmen-tal impact to foster green growth. Besides this, they should impose heavy taxes ortrade duties on importing and producing high-energy-intensive products.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.FundingGuangdong Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Planning rant (GD22CYJ03).ORCIDBaixun Wang http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5307-8464Wenjuan Zhao http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7642-8503ReferencesAcosta, L.
