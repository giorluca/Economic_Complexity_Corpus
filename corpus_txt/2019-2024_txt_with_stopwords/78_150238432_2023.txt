A system! A system maintains a certain fluid  stability that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one niche. A system has order,  a flowing from point to point. If something dams that flow, order collapses.  The untrained might miss that collapse until it was too late.   That’s why the highest function of ecology is   the understanding of consequences”   Frank Herbert, Dune     1Pardot Kynes, First Planetologist of Arrakis    v  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS   At the end of my doctoral studies, I would like to address a few words of gratitude to my thesis coordinators and to those who offered me scientific advice, support and help throughout my professional and didactic career.

Establishment of new economic activities generates negative pressures on the environment and surface waters, generating increased pollution, manifested by vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to stressors. Preliminary studies carried out within the doctoral thesis entitled "Research on the evolution, magnitude and complexity of the impact of economic activities on the East Jiu" include information on characteristic elements of the East Jiu River basin, in accordance with the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/CE. The objectives of the field research aimed to identify economic activities in the eastern Jiu Valley generating an impact on the environment (especially the mining industry, but also timber exploitation and processing, local agriculture, animal husbandry and waste storage), establishing a quarterly monitoring program of the river basin, identification of flora and fauna species and identification of areas vulnerable to potential pollution. Based on observations made in situ and on information obtained from the evolution process of the monitoring program, the appropriate methodologies for assessing physical-chemical and ecological quality of the water were selected. Study of the evolution of the impact generated by economic activities on the East Jiu was carried out by mathematical modelling, with finite volumes, of the East Jiu River basin and plotting of pollutant dispersion maps. The magnitude and complexity of impact generated by economic activities was studied by using a complex system based on fuzzy logic, designed based on interactions between natural and artificial systems, between physical-chemical indicators of water and ecosystem. The research carried out substantiates in development of necessary technical measures to reduce the impact generated by economic activities located in eastern Jiu Valley, without significantly changing the hydrodynamics of the river basin. Following research, during different research stages, methods, techniques and tools were designed and accomplished with the help of which, water and aquatic ecosystems’ quality can be assessed, as well as the impact generated by human activity on the Jiu River, at a given moment and/or continuously.  Keywords: aquatic ecosystems, CFD, environment, fuzzy logic, GIS, ichthyofauna, impact, mining, pollution, surface water, sustainable development, water quality index (WQI).     vii  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER  CONTENT   page DECLARATION OF AUTHORSHIP ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS iv SUMMARY v LIST OF FIGURES x LIST OF TABLES xiv ABBREVIATIONS xvi   INTRODUCTION 1 PURPOSE OF THE THESIS AND RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 5   CHAPTER 1 THE EAST JIU RIVER HYDROGRAPHIC BASIN 7 1.1.

The most precious category of waters is represented by fresh, liquid waters, which represent only 0.036% of the total water existing on Earth (1,385 million km3). On continents, freshwater sources are unevenly distributed, so about 30% on the land surface has permanent difficulties in providing water. Human beings and the environment conditions are inseparable entities, the existence of humans on Earth being environmentally dependent, and environmental factors (air, water, soil) can change over time as a result of anthropogenic interventions. Thus, pollution occurs, implicit and inevitable aspect of contemporary society, in which some products or services resulting from economic activities become residues that can disturb functioning and evolution of ecosystems, depending on their nature and quantity. Environmental pollution (alteration, degradation, deterioration of environmental factors’ quality under the influence of polluting substances) is a consequence of production industries using imperfect technologies, which remain, still, wasteful with raw materials and energy,
 and removal of pollution is a problem of correcting the errors that cause it.  Vulnerability of water bodies should be considered as a relative, anisotropic and dimensionless property, which depends in particular on the degree of exposure to anthropogenic pressures. Given the high vulnerability of freshwater resources, international conferences and debates are organised, on the sustainable development of society, the management and use of water resources so that they are kept healthy, productive, safe, secure and resilient. The United Nations Conference on the Environment in Stockholm in June 1972 recognized for the first time, from an international legislative point of view, the interdependence of social, technological, economic and environmental issues. Based on this truth, the concept and strategy of sustainable development were, in which ecology plays the role of a true foundation. The importance of sustainable development is accentuated and developed by the intermingling of ideas and by numerous struggles won over time by the environment, at international conferences organised on environmental issues: the Bern Convention (1979), the Rio de Janeiro Conference (1992), the Johannesburg Conference (2002), the United Nations (UN) conference in Paris (2015).   2  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER Alarm signals regarding global drinking water resources come from the United Nations, which particularly addresses multilateral forums and major world partners, announcing the danger of a possible global crisis of drinking water. UN warns, in worldwide, regional conferences and negotiations, about a potential loss of potable water up to 40% by the end of 2030, in the context where the need for water resources is expecting to increase up to 55% in 2050. Also, because of global population growth, by 2050, agriculture must produce 60% more food worldwide than at present, and in developing countries, production must double. From an industrial point of view, it is estimated that from 2000 to 2050, the increase in water demand would be up to 400%. To this end, strategies have been developed at global and European Union (EU) levels to stimulate sustainable and inclusive blue growth, thus introducing aspects of the blue economy (natural resources, energy, trade, development and security) into foreign policies. Regional strategies have also been developed to address common challenges and capitalise on current opportunities, working closely with civil society and the public and private sectors. Pollution of natural water resources creates synergistic effects, which are manifested on local aquatic ecosystems and extend continuously in time and space, generating cumulative effects on other surface and underground water bodies with which they interact or have continuity. Synergistic effects caused by natural water pollution can directly affect biological diversity, defined as the abundance of living entities in water resources. The biological diversity is represented by all species of plants, animals and microorganisms, genes they contain, interactions and complexity of interactions that the aquatic ecosystems form in the biological environment. The aquatic environment, represented by all aquatic ecosystems, developed over millions of years, began to be affected and sometimes destroyed by anthropic activities. A large number of species suffer a rapid decline, some being close to the point where their extinction begins, as a direct result of destruction of habitats, overfishing, predators or competitors deliberately introduced by humans. One of the main enemies of biodiversity is poverty, and the degree of biodiversity protection can be improved by raising the standard of living and fighting against the underdevelopment of modern society. Moreover, the pollution of the aquatic environment can have a disproportionate and adverse effect on the poor, indigenous and marginalised populations, because of the general state of health, higher potential exposures and the reduced resilience to social, environmental and economic risk. The level of understanding and knowledge of ecological decisions by the public is relatively low, and executive decision-making is at risk through the misunderstanding of environmental issues, without knowledge of essential data and functions of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Many "legends" regarding the tasks of terrestrial and marine   3  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER ecosystems developed over the years, both in the general public sector and among environmental specialists. The functions of forests related to the aquatic environment are a clear example, assuming that forests are beneficial to marine ecosystems and nevertheless, for water resources, and based on direct observations, it has been proved that they are strictly related to soil degradation through massive deforestation and soil conservation and rehabilitation through afforestation. Through logical correlation of terrestrial ecosystems, urbanised areas and aquatic ecosystems, a united image must be developed. Such a model might be essential, as a basis for conducting an in-depth dialogue between stakeholders, environmentalists and water managers. Shortly, as much as possible emphasis should be placed on information campaigns, public involvement and education in the attempt to disseminate the knowledge obtained. Most anthropic activities consume and pollute water resources, and flowing waters are the most exposed. Their vulnerability is higher in the case of rivers and their tributaries in the mountain areas, with smaller dimensions and flows, which shelter ecosystems sensitive to any form of pollution. To identify protection measures for water resources and aquatic and riparian biodiversity, it is necessary to know and analyse the impact exerted by different anthropic actions, as well as to determine their extension (in time and space), complexity and magnitude.     4  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER          5  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER  PURPOSE OF THE THESIS AND RESEARCH METHODOLOGY   The hydrosphere is an essential factor for the existence of life and the development of modern human society; therefore, protection of freshwater resources and implicitly of aquatic ecosystems is, in the context of contemporary economic development, a challenge for both the present and future generations. The novelty of the topic studied is the global approach to the concept of sustainable development (Agenda 2030), adopted at the General Meeting of the United Nations (UN) in New York in 2015. The 2030 Agenda directions of action are oriented towards ensuring availability, sustainable management of water resources and water quality conditions for all users, as well as towards protection of the aquatic environment and implicitly water resources. Primary purpose of the PhD thesis is to analyse the impact generated by economic activities in the eastern part of Jiu Valley, to establish the spatial-temporal extension of the impact they generate, as well as to determine magnitude and complexity of the impact generated by pollution of the aquatic environment on the local aquatic ecosystems and population. The main objectives set for solving the research on the chosen topic are:   Detailed knowledge of the East Jiu River basin;  Research on the fish species present in the river basin;  Study of the mechanisms generating pollutants in the river basin;  Characterization of waters from the physical-chemical and ecological point of view and their monitoring;  Analysis of the impact generated by each economic activity;  Analysis of pollutants’ dispersion in the East Jiu River basin;  Impact assessment;  Establishing technical solutions for water body protection.  In order to achieve the set objectives, the research uses hydrogeological research methods based on stationary observations, with a specific frequency, in the hydrometric stations placed along the East Jiu River basin. The samples taken with a quarterly rate in the sampling sections were analysed in the laboratory, in order to collect experimental and observation data. Based on in situ analysis of the hydrographic basin and on interpretation of results obtained from samples taken, the quality of the aquatic environment was described and protective measures of the Eastern Jiu River were developed.    6  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER The longitudinal statistical methods were used to simulate pollutants’ dispersion in the aquatic environment, to estimate the extent of the impact in the East Jiu River basin. Analytical tools were used to validate the computational model, which confers more accuracy and rigor in scientific research. Cross-sectional analyses were used to analyse the impact generated by each economic activity carried out in eastern Jiu Valley. Estimating the degree of complexity and magnitude of the impact generated by anthropic activities implied, in an early stage, the use of the Delphi method of consulting field specialists, followed by reference to hypotheses based on analyses and complex interpretations of the studied bibliography. All research methods used to carry out the doctoral thesis entitled "Research regarding the evolution, magnitude and complexity of the impact generated by economic activities on the East Jiu River" are materialized by a top-down approach, typology based on abiotic descriptive parameters, factors supposed to be in indirect relation with different biological communities (cause-effect relationship) and with degradation of water quality.     7  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER  CHAPTER 1 THE EAST JIU RIVER HYDROGRAPHIC BASIN  The hydrographic basin of the East Jiul River, located in the eastern part of the Jiu Valley (Petroșani) coal basin, constitutes, next to the hydrographic basin of the West Jiul River, the regional hydrographic network. The East Jiul River springs south of the Şureanu Mountains (1520 m), from where it runs a distance of 29 km up to the confluence with the West Jiul (554 m), where it forms the Jiu River. The tributaries of the East Jiul River are Voievod, Bile, Răscoala, Taia, Băniţa on the right side (from the Şureanu Mountains), and Sterminos, Lolea, Cimpa, Giorganu, Jieţ, Maleia, Slătioara and Sălătruc on the left side (from the Parâng Mountains), (Figure 1.1) (Romanian Waters Authority, 2012).   Figure 1.1. The East Jiu hydrographic basin Source: Own processing after (Satellite processing on the OpenStreetMap, Humanitarian Layer)  From the general features point of view, the hydrographic basin is characterized by a deep and narrow, V-shaped profile, lacking a significant riverbed because of its mountainous nature, having slopes between 30-18 ‰ for Eastern Jiu and 120-25 ‰ for its tributaries (Romanian Waters Autority, 2016 - 2021).   8  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER The abiotic typological classification of the river basin, which uses obligatory and optional parameters, defined in accordance with Appendix 1 of the Water Framework Directive, places the basin in the Carpathian Mountains ecoregion (ecoregion 10), as being at a high altitude and having an average dimension retention area. From a geological point of view, the Petroșani depression is made up of a combination of siliceous, calcareous and organogenic (biogenic) rocks, covered by lithological formations consisting of blocks, boulders and gravels. Climatic conditions of the river basin are characterized by annual average rainfall in the range of 600–1400 mm/year and average annual temperatures in the range of 0℃÷ 8℃. The East Jiu River has a specific multiannual average flow higher than 5 l /s/km2 and a minimum annual average specific flow (with 95% insurance), which is usually higher than 0.5 l/s/km2. The dynamic mechanism of sediments in the mountainous region (spring area) is manifested by local erosion phenomena. In the Piedmont region of the basin, transport phenomena seasonally accompanied by particle wear phenomenon, are predominant. East Jiu river is divided into 2 areas:   Mountain and hilly areas, characterized by a substrate made up of boulders, gravel and sand, with high water flow rates (between 5-6 m/s in the alpine area of the Eastern Jiu and lower speeds when water reaches hilly areas), clear water, rich in oxygen, with relatively low temperatures, increased roughness of the ablation and insignificant quantities of organic matter due to strong water currents.  Lower areas, where the riverbed increases considerably, resulting in much lower water speeds, reduced water oxygen levels, high turbidity and the presence of a substrate formed by a mixture of sand and mud accompanied by deposits of organic material. In winter, when water temperature drops very low, the lower East Jiu area freezes and in summer, water temperature will raise by about 2℃ compared to average annual temperature.   1.1. SOIL AND SUBSOIL OF THE EASTERN PART OF JIU VALLEY  The environmental factor that has the most to suffer as a result of mining is land, with its soil and subsoil and with it, the entire local ecosystem. Soil has a complex composition and is continuously changing. Its composition, adding to elements of mineral origin, also includes an amount of organic nature material, coming from substances of vegetal and animal origin, in various stages of transformation (Lăzar & Dumitrescu, 2006) (Lăzar, 2010).   9  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER  The land, in the eastern part of Jiu river basin, is stratigraphically composed of a complex of sedimentary rocks laid on a foundation consisting of crystalline shales belonging to the Getic domain, over which, sedimentary deposits of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Neozoic age, represented by conglomerates, marls, sandstone, shale and quaternary, have developed (Florea & Parichi, 1978) (Simion, 2016a). The diluvian cover formation has a Quaternary age, consisting of clays, gravel and gravel sands, all in various stages of transformation.  Soil types characteristic for this area are in strict agreement with lithology of sedimentary deposits of Neozoic age, namely: marls, sandstone, shale clays, over which lay Quaternary diluvian formations such as clays, sands and gravels. Alluvial soils are also found, especially in the significant riverbed of the Jiu River (Florea & Parichi, 1978) (Romanian Waters Autority, 2016 - 2021) (Simion, 2016a). Soil genetic types found in the Jiu Valley are those characteristic of mountain areas, namely soils of following classes (Florea & Parichi, 1978) (Simion, 2016a):   Mollisols - rendzina and with lithic typology;  Cambisols - brown eumezobasic and brown acid soils;  Spodosols - feriilluvial brown soils and podsols;   Undeveloped soils of lithosoil and alluvial type present at high altitudes and on surrounding slopes of the Jiu Valley.  In terms of depth, soils vary from shallow soils (lithosols) to medium deep ones, sometimes even to deep ones. Medium deep soils are most widespread and their texture is generally sandy and sometimes clayey. The humidity regime derives mainly from the moderate rainfall regime of the river basin (Rebrișoreanu, 1998). The relief is represented by erosion foothills and glaciers, with heights of 150 - 200 m, by terraces, meadows and segments of narrow and deep valleys. Rivers such as Băniţa, Valea Roşie, Taia have dug the most picturesque gorges, some of them being included on the list of protected natural areas (Simion, 2016a). The lithological character of the coal-bearing horizon, with the predominance of pelitic sequences and 
shielding effect, associated with a specific geological structure, does not present favourable premises for the formation of aquifer layers (Rebrișoreanu, 1998). The primary source for restoration of humidity in the aeration area is represented by atmospheric precipitation by its infiltration into outcrop areas of porous formations or by draining watercourses from the eastern part of the Jiu Valley. So far, no particular hydrogeological issues were reported in the mining fields (Lonea, Petrila and Livezeni) located in the East Jiu river basin.    10  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER  1.2. CLIMATE DESCRIPTION OF THE EASTERN PART OF JIU VALLEY  Climate of a region is represented by all atmospheric conditions that take place over a year, according to a scheme which is repeated from year to year (Lăzar & Dumitrescu, 2006). The eastern territory of the Petrosani depression, located in the mountain area of the Southern Carpathians, being defined by relief layout, altitude, its orientation and its morphology (slopes and valleys) records the climatic characteristics listed primarily in altitudinal differentiation of climatic parameters. Sub-mountain topoclimate of the Petrosani depression is mainly characterised by average annual temperatures between 7°C and 9°C, maximum average temperatures between 19°C and 20°C and minimum average temperatures between -3°C and -6°C (Figure 1.2).  Local rainfall regime is characterised by annual average rainfall amounts between 900 ÷ 1100 mm (approximately 172 days/year) and average thickness of snow layer, which varies between 50 ÷ 60 cm (Figure 1.3), around 119 days/year with frost. Highly cloudy days reach over 200 a year. During summer, warming is accentuated due to reduced circulation, so average monthly values range between 19.2°C in August and -6.6°C in January.   Figure 1.2. Thermal regime in Eastern Jiu Valley Source: Own processing after (Romanian National Meteorology Administration, 2017-2019)   -30.0-25.0-20.0-15.0-10.0-5.00.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.040.0Average temperature Minimum temperature Maximum temperature  11  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER  Most clear days are recorded between August and September and the rainiest months are May and June, which is also confirmed by recordings during the research period (Figure 1.3.). During the research period, average monthly precipitation ranged from 8.3 mm to 267 mm, and thickness of snow layer from 2.8 cm to 25.7 cm (Appendix 3). Increase of the average annual precipitation more in mountain area than in depressions, highlights the climatological diversity as a result of pollution generated by economic activities and by road traffic in eastern Jiu Valley. Thus, the atmosphere is more polluted and rains have a higher frequency because of dust and smoke particles in the atmosphere that play the role of condensation nuclei. Because of this phenomenon, mists and drizzles are particularly frequent, especially in autumn.  Figure 1.3. Rainfall regime in Eastern Jiu Valley Source: Own processing after (Romanian National Meteorology Administration, 2017-2019)   Changes in local rainfall significantly influence the quality of East Jiu water, manifesting in three directions:  reducing the concentration of pollutants by dilution phenomena;  transport of contaminants, either by washing the atmosphere of pollutant load or by removing residues and polluting materials present in soil;   infiltration of polluted water into the groundwater.    9.78.23.75.34.24.92.9 2.8 3.025.720.44.8051015202530050100150200250300Amount of precipitation Height of the snow layermm cm  12  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER  As for the relative humidity of air (Figure 1.4.), monthly average is higher in cold seasons (84 ÷ 88%) and lower in hot seasons (69 ÷ 80%).   Figure 1.4. Humidity and average pressure in Eastern Jiu Valley Source: Own processing after (Romanian National Meteorology Administration, 2017-2019)  The region, being a depression, favours accumulation and stagnation of cold air, which causes frequent temperature inversions even between low altitude land forms. In summer, warming is accentuated because of reduced circulation, so that daily and annual thermal amplitudes differ from other regions. Sometimes, in the winter season, because of cold air stagnation in the depression area, temperature in the Petroșani depression is lower than on the slopes surrounding it (Parâng, Șureanu, Retezat and Vâlcan). Air masses’ movement occurs in the general and local synoptic of the region, a local particularity being their displacement on the main direction of the two Jiu rivers’ valleys, with intensities of seasons, months, decades and days (Simion, 2016a).  South-South-East mis the predominant wind direction (Appendix 3), with relatively low average air current speeds ranging between 0.9 and 1.6 m/s (Figure 1.5.). The valley, being a depression, surrounded by high mountain massifs, generates an unusual nature of hazard and accumulation of air masses. In creating this natural hazard, anthropogenic factors, especially changes in the physical-chemical characteristics of atmospheric air, particularly generated by mining industry, contribute significantly. 6956976997017037057077097117137156065707580859095100Average umidity [%] Average atmospheric pressure[%] [mmHg]  13  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER  Figure 1.5. Average wind speed in Eastern Jiu Valley Source: Own processing after (Romanian National Meteorology Administration, 2017-2019)  In the cities of eastern Jiu Valley and in the areas where the height of constructions is medium to high, with a particular density, the velocity of unidirectional winds is much diminished; instead, local swirls are more frequent. Directed circulation of air masses in the region, as a component of wind regime in Jiu Valley, determines the carry-over of particles from residue and combustion product deposits (smoke, soot, ash), loading the atmosphere with pollutants. Transfer of contaminants to freshwater surfaces is accomplished either by direct transport or by washing the atmosphere by precipitation, in case of contaminants dispersed in the atmosphere. The mountain topoclimate is in direct relation with the relief, determined by high altitudes of mountains Parâng, Șureanu, Retezat and Vâlcan, characterizing the Petrosani depression, from a climatic point of view, as an area with average annual temperatures ranging between -2°C and 6°C, average annual rainfall amounts of about 1400 mm and an average snow layer thickness between 80 and 100 cm.   1.3. GEOLOGICAL PARTICULARITIES OF THE EASTERN PART OF JIU VALLEY   In the upper part of eastern Jiu Valley, from the geological point of view (Figure 1.6.), the Eastern Jiu river crosses areas with metathetic migmatites, in which the metasomatic ratio materialises through quartz and potassium feldspar, which varies significantly from a 1.60.90.80.91.01.11.21.31.41.51.61.7Average wind speed [m/s] Maximum speed [m/s] Minimum speed [m/s]m/s  14  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER quantitative point of view. The quartz-feldspar process is often very advanced; thus, the structure and texture of original rocks has almost been obliterated, the metasomatism leading to formation of granitoid rocks with a granodioritic and dioritic composition.  Figure 1.6. Geological map of Eastern Jiu Valley Source: Own processing after (Geological map of Romania scale 1: 200 000, 1965)  The upper part of East Jiu river also includes small deposits of pegmatites, serpentinite, peridotite, dunes, calcareous sandstone, calcareous, massive limestone, siliceous quartzite, quartzite, quartzite with sericite, amphibolite, amphibolic shale, etc (Geological map of Romania scale 1: 200 000, 1965). In the hilly area, the East Jiu enters an area with fluvial deposits, consisting of rounded gravels, sands and clays formed in the Burdigalian Miocene, usually characterized by an unparalleled (cross) arrangement of layers. From the geological point of view, in the area were identified deposits of shale clays, coal, marls with thicknesses between 20 and 350 m, formed in the Chattian Aquitaine Oligocene, sands and gravels belonging to the lower and medium terrace, with thicknesses of about 50 m, formed in the upper Pleistocene. The fragmentation of relief, the accentuated erosion, the micro-landslides and the collapses have led to formation of numerous fossil nests of invertebrates of particular scientific importance due to richness and rarity of species   15  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER (Drăghindă, 1956). On the south-eastern edge of the Petroşani depression, arise two areas of Sonian deposits, consisting of conglomerates, clays, marls and limestone (Drăghindă, 1956), which contain a diverse fauna consisting of Plesioptygmatis aff. Bicinta Bronn, Plesioptygmatis aff. Djirmanijensis, Inoceramus balticus Boehm, Actaeonella sp (Drăghindă, 1956).   1.4. GROUNDWATER FEATURES OF THE EASTERN PART OF JIU VALLEY  The groundwater, phreatic and deep-water bodies of the Petroşani Depression are of fisural type, being accumulated in conglomerates, sandstones, marls and shale clays of Burdigalian age, from the composition of Petrosani sedimentary basin. This basin has a syncline structure oriented in V-E direction; the axis has been located north from West Jiu (Romanian Jiu) (Romanian Waters Autority, 2016 - 2021). East from Vulcan town, the basin has the structure of a syncline. The median anticline (the Slatinioara anticline) separates, to East, two synclines of a smaller magnitude: at N, Petrila syncline and at S, Sălătruc syncline. The basin was affected by numerous longitudinal faults, developed on its edges and by a series of transverse faults, of which the most important ones are those in the Petrila area  (Romanian Waters Autority, 2016 - 2021). Burdigalian aquifer deposits are partially uncoated, partly covered by soil or by different genetic types of quaternary deposits (fluvial, alluvial, diluvial, colluvial, eluvial, etc.). The protection degree of groundwater is strongly unsatisfactory because the aquifer is not being sufficiently fed, the supply is mainly carried out through the frame area, from surface waters and precipitation (Romanian Waters Autority, 2016 - 2021). From a quantitative point of view, the flows of underground springs vary depending on season, ranging between 0.14 and 6 l/s and the effective regional infiltration ranges between 315 and 472.5 mm/year.   1.5. FLORA AND FAUNA OF THE EASTERN PART OF JIU VALLEY   Aquatic flora and fauna of the East Jiu river basin should be viewed and analysed as an element of naturalistic importance or as an economic resource. Still, the characteristic of “elementum vitae essentiale” of the environment should not be neglected. Eastern Jiu is a mountain river accompanied, at the top, by strips of forest with species characteristic of mountainous and sub-montane areas. From upstream to the confluence with the East Jiu one can find conifers, beech, oak, mixed with elm and birch, willow and alder, anchored very well in the soft and moist soils (Simion, 2016a). Flow and speed of the running water are the main elements that determine the ecosystem’s physiognomy and composition of biocenosis (Lăzar & Dumitrescu, 2006). Aquatic ecosystems of the eastern Jiu Valley divide according to characteristics and properties of   16  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER the living environment (respectively water), but also according to peculiarities of relief, which is crossed by streams and rivers, in freshwater (lentic ecosystems) and running water (lotic ecosystems) ecosystems. Depending on these characteristics, the hydrographic basin of the East Jiu parts into two areas: mountain area and hilly area.  1.5.1. Upper area of the East Jiu River (mountain area) is characterized by a mountain specific biotope, with high water flow rates, low turbidity, waters rich in oxygen and low temperatures. The riverbed substrate is mainly made up of boulders and gravels. In the area where the river basin’s slopes are steep, no organic matter is deposed because of strong water currents, waterfalls being very common. The hydrological basin’s biocenosis consists of green algae and water mosses, invertebrates (snails, worms, trichopterans insects, crustaceans well fixed by the substrate), fish (common bullhead or miller's thumb  - on the water's edge, the stone loach - under rocks, trout, barbel, nase and Danubian long barbel gudgeon and minnow - in the water body), amphibians (green frog, triton, salamander) and birds (common blackbird, grey wagtail) (Onciu, 2007). The bottom animals or those from the substrate of the Eastern Jiu river bed are medium density zooplankton, dominated by protozoans, especially by two key species: Vorticella chloro stigma and Vorticella Campanula, rotifers, nematodes, cladocerans, scaphopods, harpacticoids (the last two are crustaceans), which undoubtedly indicates low turbidity of the river, average speeds and minimum quantities of suspensions, oligochaetes, chironomid isopods (Asellus aquaticus) and hirudinelle (Erpobdella monostriatata, Erprbdella octoculata) gammarids (Rirulogamodus balcanicus) mayflies, snails and slugs (Physa acută, Radis peregra), hydroacarians (Sperchom glandulosus), springtails and coelenterates (Hydra) (Onciu, 2007).  1.5.2. Lower area of the East Jiu River (hilly area) The biotope of the lower East Jiu area is characterized by a substrate of sand and mud, a riverbed larger than the upstream, much lower water velocities, higher flow, waters with high turbidity levels, reduced dissolved oxygen levels, high water temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter and the presence of a much more pronounced organic material at the bottom of the water (Onciu, 2007) (Simion, 2016a).    Main components of the biocenosis are microscopic green algae, lynx, frog grass, invertebrate animals that form phytoplankton, microscopic animals that form zooplankton (worms, shells, snails, insects) and vertebrate animals (frogs, snakes and birds, and fish) (Onciu, 2007).. The primary factor that intervenes in spread and maintenance of these ecosystems is mainly human activity, along with general and local ecological factors.   17  RESEARCHES REGARDING THE EVOLUTION, MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON THE EAST JIU RIVER Following the researches, it was found that the East Jiu’s ichthyofauna is composed of numerous species such as Barbus petenyi or Barbus meridionalis petenyi (violet blue barbel or stained barbel), Romanogobio uranoscopus (Danubian longbarbel gudgeon), Salmo trutta fario (trout) , Barbatula barbatula (stone loach), Thymallus thymallus (grayling), Squalius cephalus (chub), Alburnus alburnus (bleak), Cottus gobio (miller’s thumb or common bullhead) etc (Romanian Waters Autority, 2016 - 2021). Other species of aquatic fauna identified: Austropotamobius torrentium (sparrow), Coluber caspius (snake), Bombina bombina (frog), etc. From a morphological point of view, the East Jiu is a mountain river in which water speed is high, with steep slopes and narrow riverbeds and the aquatic flora is impoverished, with only a few species belonging to the isoetales and hydropteridales orders. The riparian terrestrial ecosystems are composed of plant and animal species that usually live on the banks of watercourses. They can directly or indirectly influence the quality of water and in turn, can be influenced by the quality of water. This category of ecosystems includes species of plants and animals that live near the water
