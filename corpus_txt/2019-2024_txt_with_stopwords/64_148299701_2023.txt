In this paper, we test whether the economic com-plexity of a country is relevant for understanding the impact of remittances on new firms’ birth. We find evidence that the impact of real per capita remittances on new firms’ creation is inversely mediated by economic complexity. More (less) com-plex economies generate opportunities to found new firms which need high (low) funding. Since economic complexity is positively correlated with economic devel-opment, remittances are more likely to facilitate the establishment of new firms in less developed economies rather than in more advanced ones. We also examine the link between remittances and new firm creation for Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean countries, finding very heterogeneous patterns. Hence, policy implications aiming at attracting remittances to create new firms should respond to the challenges posed by specific countries and be tailored to their peculiar needs. Countries of origin should build institutions and facilitate the crea-tion of networks to bridge the diaspora abroad with their home country to increase awareness of new business opportunities. Policy initiatives could spur investment in the formal economy by making regulations less stringent, discouraging the use of remittances for consumption purposes, reducing informality, improving competi-tion, reducing remittance transfer costs, and giving incentives to new firms created through remittances.Keywords New firms · Remittances · Economic complexity index · Economic developmentJEL Classification F24 · L26 · O19 · O50I wish to thank the Journal editor George Hondroyiannis and two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful and constructive comments on an earlier version of the paper.

These diasporas signifi-cantly affect their countries of origin, including their social, political, and economic environments, as discussed by social scientists. Economists have investigated how diasporas impact the economy of the origin countries, particularly in terms of eco-nomic development (Bahar 2020). One of the most hotly debated issues is the role of remittances, with two opposing views: an optimistic one that sees positive effects and a pessimistic one that denies them (Clemens and McKenzie 2018; Naudé et al. 2017; Yang 2011). One less explored issue regarding the role of remittances in the economy is their impact on creating new firms. This paper aims to address this gap and examine whether the economic complexity of a country is relevant for under-standing the impact of remittances on new firm creation. Our research is framed around three key points.Firstly, in the last few decades, remittances have grown exponentially from $122 million in 2000 to $706 million in 2020, representing a more than fivefold increase (Fig. 1) (World Bank 2021). In many countries, remittances have become the pri-mary financial flow, surpassing foreign direct investment and official development assistance flows. Furthermore, a significant portion of international remittances is transmitted through informal channels and goes unrecorded in official statistics.1 The growing importance of remittances for investment purposes has drawn the attention of scholars in various fields, such as economics, management, entrepreneurship, and international development agencies (Ratha 2003, 2007). Although remittances are 01,00,0002,00,0003,00,0004,00,0005,00,0006,00,0007,00,0008,00,000200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017201820192020Fig. 1  Migrant remittance inflows (US$ million) Source: World Bank1 Ratha (2017) claims unrecorded flows through informal channels are at least 50 per cent larger than recorded flows.1 3Economic Change and Restructuring primarily used for non-investment purposes, such as food, housing, and education, they have been shown to stimulate new investments as a source of financial funds. In fact, many studies have suggested that remittances play a potentially positive role in new business creation. Single-country (e.g., Kiliç et al. 2009; Woodruff and Zenteno 2007) and cross-country studies (e.g., Cummings et  al. 2021; Yavuz and Bahadir 2022) have found a positive correlation between remittances and new business activ-ities. These studies hypothesize that remittances increase entrepreneurial activities by providing financial resources for new investments.Secondly, new firms generate more employment than larger incumbent firms (Haltiwanger 2015), and this explains why policymakers try to design policy incen-tives to promote entrepreneurship (Ratinho et  al. 2020). However, in many coun-tries, particularly low-income ones, there is a lack of capital needed to start new firms. If remittances from migrants can provide an alternative and additional source of funding for new businesses, it could significantly benefit the economic and social well-being of these countries.Thirdly, it is surprising that the connection between economic complexity and entrepreneurship has received little attention in the literature. According to Nguyen et al. (2021), existing empirical studies on the determinants of entrepreneurship tend to adopt either a micro- or macro-perspective, occasionally exploring the impact of government efficiency and institutional quality. However, they overlook the crucial role of the economy’s structure in entrepreneurship. In a recent survey, Ratinho et al. (2020) suggest that future research should investigate the relationship between eco-nomic structure and entrepreneurship.In this paper, we make several contributions to the literature. Firstly, we show that the impact of real per capita remittances (REM) on new firm creation is inversely mediated by economic complexity. Since economic complexity is positively corre-lated with economic development, remittances are more likely to facilitate the estab-lishment of new firms in less developed economies rather than in more advanced ones. Secondly, our sub-sample analysis for high and upper-middle-income (HUMI) countries on the one hand and low- and lower-middle-income (LLMI) countries on the other corroborates our hypothesis regarding the positive impact of REM on new limited liability company (NLLC) creation in LLMI countries and the negative impact in HUMI countries. Furthermore, in both sub-samples the economic com-plexity index (ECI) negatively mediates the impact of REM on NLLC. Thirdly, the sub-sample analysis at the regional level (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean) reveals that in Africa, the average marginal effect of REM on NLLC creation is negative, despite increasing as ECI grows. In Asia, the average marginal effect of REM on NLLC creation is positive and decreases as ECI increases. In Europe, we do not find any positive or negative role, whereas, in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, we observe a consistently positive average marginal effect of REM on NLLC creation, which increases as ECI increases. Fourthly, based on our empirical results, we present and discuss some policy implications. Our find-ings suggest that economic policies should be tailored to the specific needs of each country to address the challenges they face. Policy initiatives such as reducing infor-mality, improving competition, lowering remittance transfer costs, and introducing a special legal status for new firms created through remittances would facilitate the  Economic Change and Restructuring1 3channelling of remittances toward new business creation. Additionally, institutions in origin countries should encourage the creation of diaspora networks to increase awareness of new business opportunities in their respective countries of origin.Due to data availability constraints, we examine 78 countries from 2006 to 2020 in our empirical analysis, and we use a negative binomial regression model to esti-mate the relationship between remittances, economic complexity, and new firm cre-ation. This estimation strategy is suitable because our dependent variable is an over-dispersed count variable.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we review the relevant literature. Section 3 provides a detailed account of our empirical investi-gation, and Sect. 4 presents our results. Policy implications are discussed in Sect. 5, and the paper concludes with Sect. 6.2  Literature reviewThe literature on the impact of remittances on economic complexity, its effect on new firms, and the role of remittances in new firm creation are still in its early stages, with only a few studies available for citation. To our knowledge, the interre-lated connections among remittances, economic complexity, and the creation of new firms have never been explored.Saadi (2020) analyzed the impact of remittances on economic complexity and found that they have a significant positive effect on the complexity of products exported by developing and emerging countries. Using an unbalanced panel from 2002 to 2014, he maintains that remittances encourage business investment and that the entrepreneurial use of remittances enables developing countries to upgrade their production and diversify their exports into more complex goods (Saadi 2020, p. 19).Nguyen et al. (2021) and Ajide (2022) have recently analyzed the impact of eco-nomic complexity on entrepreneurship. Nguyen et al. (2021) argue that “improve-ments in economic complexity reflect the development of the economic systems and conditions that boost industrial production and enhance product quality” and that “these improved conditions are usually associated with business opportunities (demands for new products and services) as well as risks (competition with multiple newcomers) for entrepreneurs” (Nguyen et  al. 2021; p. 2). Following these prem-ises, they show that entrepreneurship density, i.e., the number of new firms over the working-age population, follows an inverted U-shaped function of economic com-plexity. They conceptualize this finding as increasing economic complexity leading to two potentially conflicting results: creating new opportunities for opening new firms and bringing higher levels of competition and uncertainties for entrepreneurs, particularly if a country has already achieved high levels of complexity. Ajide (2022) evaluates the impact of economic complexity on entrepreneurship in 18 African countries between 2006 and 2017. He finds a positive relationship between new firm density and economic complexity and suggests that entrepreneurship is “strengthened by ethnic and religious diversity but reduced by weak political institu-tions” (Ajide 2022, p. 383). Given that most African countries operate at low levels of economic complexity, these findings are not surprising.1 3Economic Change and Restructuring Several other studies have explored the impact of immigrants’ remittances on new firm creation.2 The seminal work in this area is Vaaler’s (2011) analysis of 61 non-OECD and other developing countries between 2002 and 2007. Among other findings, Vaaler reports that remittances alone do not affect new firm creation. How-ever, when he introduces an interaction term between remittances and the state share of the economy (measured by the share of GDP accounted for by the government and state-owned enterprises), he observes a positive impact of remittances on new firm creation at low levels of the state share of the economy, which disappears as the state share of the economy increases.Since Vaaler’s (2011) pioneering work, empirical research on the relationship between remittances and new firm creation has grown, with studies including Mar-tinez et  al. (2015), Hanusch and Vaaler (2015), Cummings and Gamlen (2019), Cummings et  al. (2021), Yavuz and Bahar (2022), Bettin et  al. (2022), Ajide and Osinubi (2022), Nanyiti and Sseruyange (2022), and Alhassan (2023).Martinez et  al. (2015) examine the relationship between informality, remit-tances, venture funding availability, and the new firm starts in a sample of 38 developing countries from 2001 to 2009. They find that remittances increase new firms starts when informality increases. Interestingly, they also find that when informality is nil, the effect of remittances on new firms starts is negative, point-ing toward a re-direction of remittances toward household consumption rather than investments. Similarly, Hanusch and Vaaler (2015) investigate whether the positive impact of remittances on new firm creation is constrained by capital access in a sample of 47 developing countries for the 2002–2007 period. They find that remittances increase new firm birth, but the effect diminishes as capital access increases. Cummings and Gamlen (2019) study whether diaspora engage-ment policies pursued by many developing or emerging countries amplify the pos-itive impacts of remittances on entrepreneurship. They consider a sample of 35 countries observed from 2001 to 2010 and find that remittances positively affect new venture funding availability and new firm creation. Moreover, they confirm their conjecture about the magnifying effect of diaspora engagement institutions on remittances in favor of new firm creation. Cummings et al. (2021) focus on a sample of 29 developing countries from 2001 to 2010 and find that remittances 2 In the present study, we analyze the role of real per capita remittances on new limited liabilities com-panies (new firms’ registration) and take data from the world development indicators (see sub-Sect. 3.1 for more details). Another strand of empirical literature studies the impact of remittances on entrepre-neurship using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) database. The data collected by GEM com-prises two complementary tools: the Adult Population Survey (APS) and the National Expert Survey (NES). The former explores the individual’s role in the entrepreneurial process’s lifecycle through an administered survey (2000 adults are interviewed). The latter assesses the status of the Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions (EFCs) through interviews with at least 36 experts. Our research questions cannot be satisfactorily addressed as it consists of self-reported data rather than company registration data. For this reason, in this literature section, we do not review any of these works; the interested reader can see the recent paper of Bedi et al. (2020) and the references therein. For more general surveys regarding new firms’ creation, see the recent contributions of Ratinho et al. (2020) from the perspective of the manage-rial sciences and of Lu et al. (2020) for a more general approach that also includes works in the fields of accounting, economics, finance, innovation, and organization studies. Quite surprisingly, neither the former nor the latter cite papers dealing with the role of remittances in entrepreneurship. Economic Change and Restructuring1 3from migrants residing abroad for less than a year significantly increase venture founding rates, measured by newly registered firms. They interpret this result as reflecting a stronger home-country identity for migrants who reside abroad and remit to agents at home to help found new ventures that provide livelihoods for those migrants upon return. Yavuz and Bahadir (2022) are primarily interested in the role of ethnic diversity in new business creation. Using data on 64 developing countries from 2006 to 2016, they find that migrant remittances correlate posi-tively with new business creation, and ethnic diversity strengthens this positive association. According to Yavuz and Bahadir 2022, p. 1943), this positive link depends on the 
special relationship that migrants maintain with those they left behind. In their view, not only do migrants’ remittances act as founding resources for new firms, but they also inject new knowledge, skills, and practices into their home countries. Authors (2022) studied a very large panel of 143 countries from 2006 to 2018 and investigated the role of social and financial remittances in new firm creation. They find that both kinds of remittances are positively and signifi-cantly correlated with new firm creation for the entire sample of 143 countries and that the effect of financial remittances depends on the level of social remittances. Once social remittances exceed a threshold level, financial remittances do not con-tribute to new firm creation. They also perform a disaggregated analysis, separat-ing developing and developed countries and non-OECD and OECD countries. The results for both developing and non-OECD countries are similar to those for the entire sample, while developed and OECD countries do not seem to benefit from remittances as a booster for new firm creation.The last three papers on remittances and new firm creation, namely Ajide and Osinubi (2022), Nanyiti and Sseruyange (2022), and Alhassan (2023), use firms’ density (NLLC per 1000 working-age population) as the dependent variable instead of the absolute number of new firms’ creation. Ajide and Osinubi (2022) use a sam-ple of 19 African countries from 2006 to 2017 and find that foreign aid and remit-tance harm new firms’ density. However, remittances mitigate the negative impact of foreign aid on entrepreneurship, indicating that both variables are complemen-tary in improving the level of entrepreneurship in Africa. They claim that formal entrepreneurship involves high start-up costs in Africa, discouraging potential entrepreneurs from starting a new business. To become a formal entrepreneur, one needs to bear the higher cost of formalizing operations and higher risks compared with other alternatives, and this trade off disincentives to engage in entrepreneur-ship. Nanyiti and Sseruyange (2022) analyze 63 developing and developed coun-tries and find a positive effect of remittances on firms’ density, which is stronger for LLMI countries and disappears for HUMI countries. Alhassan (2023) inves-tigates the effectiveness of e-government as a mechanism for reducing migrants’ transaction costs and promoting remittance-based opportunity entrepreneurship in 55 African, Asian, Oceanian, and Latin American countries from 2007 to 2019. The empirical results for the entire sample indicate no role for remittances, but a statistically negative direct effect is found for African countries. However, he also finds that e-government positively moderates the association between remittances and new firms’ density.1 3Economic Change and Restructuring A summary of the findings regarding the link between remittances and new firms is presented in Table 1. Three main results emerge from this field of research. First, most studies find a positive (or non-negative) link between remittances and new firm creation. Second, the role of remittances can be mediated by other factors. Third, empirical research focuses almost exclusively on developing or African countries.This study aims to extend the literature by exploring the interconnected relation-ships among remittances, economic complexity, and new firm creation. To achieve this, we use a large sample of heterogeneous countries and split it into LLMI and HUMI countries. We also conduct a more disaggregated regional analysis at the con-tinental level, focusing on Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.3  Empirical investigation3.1  Sample description, summary statistics, and data sourcesLimited by data availability, our dataset consists of an unbalanced panel comprising 78 countries from 2006 to 2020. As Table 2 indicates, the dataset is highly heteroge-neous regarding the income levels of the countries included. According to the 2022 World Bank Income Classification, 22 countries are considered high-income, 24 are upper-middle-income, 23 are lower-middle-income, and nine are low-income. The majority of the countries included are African (23), followed by Asian (21), Euro-pean (16), Latin American and the Caribbean (15), Oceanian (2), and North Ameri-can (1) countries.Table  3 provides names, descriptions, and sources of all variables used in this study. The World Bank development indicators (WDI) were used to retrieve data on NLLC, remittances received,3 real per capita GDP growth rate (GDPPCGR), real per capita GDP level (GDPPC), openness to trade (TRADE), net foreign direct investment,4 real interest rate (RIR), domestic credit to the private sector (CREDIT), total population (POP), percentage of the population using the Inter-net (INTERNET), and the share of employment in the agricultural (EMPAGR) and industrial (EMPIND) sectors. The economic complexity index (ECI) was obtained from the MIT Observatory of Economic Complexity. The ease of doing business (EDB) score was taken from the World Bank’s (WB) Doing Business database. The share of gross capital formation (SGCF) and the human capital index (HCI) were sourced from the Penn World Tables (PWT). Finally, the voice and accountability index (VAI), the size of the government index (SGI), and the democracy index (DI) were obtained from Kaufmann (2010), Gwartney et al. (2022), and Coppedge et al. (2023), respectively.Tables 4 and 5 provide summary statistics demonstrating considerable heteroge-neity across countries. In this section, we briefly discuss the summary statistics of 3 In the empirical analysis, we use real per capita remittances (REM) as an explanatory variable (see below).4 In the empirical analysis, we use net foreign direct investment divided by total population (FDIPOP).

On average, the number of new firms for the whole sample is 49,993, but it is much lower for LLMI countries (19,610), substantially higher for HUMI countries (65,334), and peaks at 90,717 in Europe. The minimum and maximum values of NLLC vary enormously, ranging from 226 (Paraguay in 2020) to 774,854 (The United Kingdom in 2020). Real per capita remittances received on average are 1.79 dollars (expressed in real terms, base year 2010), but significant differences emerge between LLMI (1.04) and HUMI (2.20) countries. Even more striking differences emerge at the continental level, with European countries at the top (2.78), followed by Latin American and the Table 2  List and income classification of countriesIncome classification according to the World Bank Income Classification (worldbank.org): HI = high-income, UMI = upper-middle-income, LMI = lower-middle-income, LI = low-income.

On average, real per capita remittances received in Africa are just 14% of that of Europe, about 18% of Latin America and the Caribbean, and 22% of Asia. REM is equal to zero in Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, and Zimbabwe in various years, and it attained its maximum value for Jamaica in 2005 (15.12). The mean value of the ECI for the whole sample is 0.03, but significant differences emerge between LLMI (-0.68) and HUMI (0.51) countries. As regards continents, Europe records the highest value (0.82), followed by Asia (0.24), Latin America and the Caribbean (-0.09), and Africa (-0.76). The differences are more evident looking at the single country-year minimum and maxi-mum: ECI ranged between -2.70 for Kuwait in 2008 and 2.65 for Japan in 2005.3.2  Dependent variableThe number of NLLCs is defined as those registered in the private, formal sector per calendar year. It should be noted that in many countries, particularly develop-ing ones, informal firms account for up to half of economic activity (La Porta and Shleifer 2014). The exclusion of the informal sector is based on the challenges of quantifying them. The World Bank employs consistent measurements and concepts applicable across countries in data collection. Specifically, national business regis-tries are the primary sources of information. In limited liability firms, the financial liability of the owners is limited to the value of their investment in the company.3.3  Main independent variablesPersonal remittances are the sum of personal transfers and compensation of employ-ees. To obtain real per capita remittances (REM) used in the empirical analysis, we standardize remittances by country population and express them in real terms using the GDP deflator, where the GDP deflator is from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Since price levels and inflation rates vary enormously across countries, we maintain that real rather than nominal remittances should be used when analyzing their role in the real economy.5The literature reviewed above suggests that the direct link between remittances and new firm creation is mostly positive (or non-negative) and that other variables can moderate (i.e., magnify or cushion) the effects of remittances on new firm crea-tion. In this paper, we aim to examine the mediating role of ECI in this relationship, and the interaction between REM and ECI is considered.The economic complexity index was first introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009). According to Hausmann et al. (2014, p. 18), “complex economies are those that can weave vast quantities of relevant knowledge together, 
across large networks 5 Among other things, a possible explanation of why empirical results on the role of remittances on the economy often produce conflicting results might be that almost all empirical studies utilize nominal rather than real remittances.1 3Economic Change and Restructuring Table 4  Summary statistics (total, low and lower-middle-income, high and upper-middle-income coun-tries)Variable Total LLMI HUMI Variable Total LLMI HUMINLLC Mean 49,993 19,610 65,334 CREDIT Mean 56.71 28.20 75.71S.D 97,134 27,576 114,546 S.D 43.60 18.64 45.11Median 14,620 8098 23,808 Median 40.04 24.31 64.69Min 226 312 226 Min 3.47 3.47 10.65Max 774,854 142,000 774,854 Max 193.52 115.53 193.52REM Mean 1.79 1.04 2.20 VAI Mean 0.04 -0.53 0.42S.D 2.19 1.09 2.51 S.D 0.85 0.56 0.78Median 1.00 0.60 1.12 Median 0.00 -0.42 0.50Min 0.00 0.00 0.00 Min -2.23 -2.23 -1.75Max 15.12 5.56 15.12 Max 1.74 0.46 1.74ECI Mean 0.03 -0.68 0.51 SGI Mean 6.89 6.91 6.89S.D 0.95 0.56 0.86 S.D 1.09 1.12 1.07Median − 0.13 − 0.77 0.33 Median 6.91 6.92 6.90Min − 2.70 − 2.26 − 2.70 Min 3.30 3.30 4.41Max 2.65 0.96 2.65 Max 9.27 8.98 9.27ECI*REM Mean 0.44 − 0.52 0.96 POP Mean 76.25 109.35 58.13S.D 2.05 1.20 2.22 S.D 222.89 251.65 203.39Median 0.00 − 0.14 0.22 Median 16.85 33.90 9.46Min − 6.11 − 6.11 − 5.81 Min 0.87 2.53 0.87Max 8.93 2.84 8.93 Max 1397.71 1366.42 1397.71GDPPCGR Mean 2.62 3.19 2.31 HCI Mean 2.70 2.20 2.97S.D 3.33 3.38 3.26 S.D 0.62 0.54 0.47Median 2.64 3.50 2.03 Median 2.72 2.17 2.95Min − 18.49 − 18.49 − 13.57 Min 1.16 1.16 1.62Max 18.07 18.07 14.75 Max 4.35 3.29 4.35GDPPC Mean 14.56 1.70 21.59 TRADE Mean 80.36 68.67 86.63S.D 20.37 1.15 22.39 S.D 48.64 30.81 54.90Median 5.59 1.37 10.03 Median 69.06 60.69 75.60Min 0.23 0.23 1.66 Min 20.72 20.72 22.11Max 92.56 4.83 92.56 Max 437.33 210.40 437.33SGCF Mean 0.23 0.21 0.24 FDIPOP Mean − 0.01 − 0.01 − 0.02S.D 0.08 0.09 0.08 S.D 0.16 0.02 0.20Median 0.23 0.21 0.23 Median − 0.01 0.00 − 0.02Min 0.05 0.05 0.09 Min − 1.99 − 0.16 − 1.99Max 0.58 0.56 0.58 Max 1.49 0.14 1.49EMPAGR Mean 25.18 46.73 13.21 INTER-NETMean 40.39 15.70 56.88S.D 21.77 18.61 11.99 S.D 30.02 15.38 25.81Median 20.25 44.19 9.14 Median 36.72 10.50 59.90Min 0.06 8.34 0.06 Min 0.07 0.07 3.26Max 81.96 81.96 46.04 Max 99.65 75.04 99.65 Economic Change and Restructuring1 3of people, to generate a diverse mix of knowledge-intensive products. By contrast, simpler economies have a narrow of productive knowledge and produce fewer and simpler products, which require smaller webs of interaction”. The core idea of ECI is that it captures the sophistication of a given economy’s products. Economic com-plexity includes the breadth of an economy’s exports and how knowledge-intensive they are. A country that produces many products that few other countries can pro-duce has a broad range of productive capacities. Conversely, a country that produces few products that many other countries can make is likely to have few productive capabilities. Therefore, economic complexity is a crucial factor that can help explain entrepreneurship and new firm creation. If a country takes on more innovative activities, it will likely produce a broad range of products, making it more complex. Thus, complex economies generate more opportunities to start a business venture and innovate. At the same time, they will need higher funding to start a new busi-ness. On the contrary, less complex economies produce fewer and simpler products and require lower funding levels to create new businesses. In this regard, Nguyen et al. (2021) found that entrepreneurship density is an inverted U-shaped function of economic complexity. This relationship exists because an increase in economic complexity reflects the rise in economic diversification that leads to new business opportunities. However, new opportunities also mean higher competition and uncer-tainty, and beyond some level of economic complexity, higher competition might stop or even discourage new business opportunities (Nguyen et al. 2021, p. 4).According to these theoretical premises, countries with low levels of economic complexity presumably produce goods and services that do not require particularly complex technologies and can be realized with relatively low investments. There-fore, ECI will likely negatively mediate the impact of REM on NLLC. Countries with low levels of economic complexity will probably engage in producing goods and services with newly created firms that do not need high start-up costs, precisely the kind of new firms that can be established with relatively low initial investments that can be set up with the aid of remittances coming from abroad. Conversely, in countries with high economic complexity, new firms must bear high initial Table 4  (continued)Variable Total LLMI HUMI Variable Total LLMI HUMIEMPIND Mean 20.39 15.77 22.96 EDB Mean 76.79 67.11 83.04S.D 7.75 7.62 6.54 S.D 15.74 17.54 10.48Median 20.15 15.72 21.44 Median 80.72 71.12 85.35Min 3.42 3.42 12.67 Min 15.48 15.48 40.01Max 59.58 33.93 59.58 Max 98.38 95.13 98.38RIR Mean 5.73 6.12 5.46 DI Mean 0.58 0.44 0.67S.D 9.27 11.42 7.44 S.D 0.23 0.16 0.23Median 4.63 5.41 4.15 Median 0.60 0.45 0.74Min − 81.13 − 81.13 − 18.30 Min 0.08 0.09 0.08Max 52.44 52.44 44.64 Max 0.93 0.76 0.931 3Economic Change and Restructuring Table 5  Summary statistics (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean)VariableAfricaAsiaEurLACVariableAfricaAsiaEurLACNLLCMean27,31231,31590,71749,459CREDITMean28.8172.4782.1241.84S.D70,06042,506146,13879,625S.D28.2445.7745.4524.29Median656614,22431,74512,260Median19.1059.8166.9234.38Min3125301671226Min4.043.4720.0610.65Max486,900245,321774,854405,049Max142.42193.52192.06124.57REMMean0.391.752.782.18VAIMean− 0.34− 0.420.800.30S.D0.552.002.182.71S.D0.620.770.730.50Median0.170.982.091.13Median− 0.29− 0.490.970.21Min0.000.000.000.03Min− 1.67− 2.23− 1.13− 1.10Max2.628.8310.1415.12Max0.941.111.741.31ECIMean− 0.760.240.82− 0.09SGIMean6.637.086.467.63S.D0.471.060.740.57S.D1.071.080.940.85Median− 0.740.080.70− 0.16Median6.697.196.597.75Min− 2.26− 2.70− 0.63− 1.20Min3.304.414.435.73Max0.242.652.331.39Max8.888.988.739.27ECI*REMMean− 0.350.132.10− 0.27POPMean35.33197.1020.5434.26S.D0.761.692.631.40S.D41.04393.3423.3952.70Median− 0.100.031.24− 0.01Median22.8950.079.7710.63Min− 5.44− 6.11− 2.79− 5.81Min1.230.872.662.74Max0.068.548.934.70Max200.961397.71144.50211.05GDPPCGR Mean2.403.581.932.49HCIMean2.042.773.332.58S.D3.403.503.142.98S.D0.460.550.240.31Median2.783.881.732.51Median2.082.793.312.61Min− 18.49− 13.57− 14.38− 6.85Min1.161.742.851.62Max18.0715.1511.149.97Max2.944.353.773.15 Economic Change and Restructuring1 3Table 5  (continued)VariableAfricaAsiaEurLACVariableAfricaAsiaEurLACGDPPCMean2.7714.2831.937.28TRADEMean68.5595.1788.7764.82S.D2.8019.6326.343.75S.D24.1776.4333.0327.22Median1.233.6833.907.08Median63.6872.1683.2062.36Min0.230.601.661.41Min20.7224.4939.2722.11Max10.8969.6892.5615.11Max127.20437.33169.84166.70SGCFMean0.220.270.230.20FDIPOPMean− 0.03− 0.020.02− 0.02S.D0.100.100.060.05S.D0.190.140.200.02Median0.210.260.240.20Median0.000.00− 0.02− 0.02Min0.070.050.050.11Min− 1.99− 1.05− 1.05− 0.12Max0.560.580.350.37Max0.080.451.490.06EMPAGR Mean46.3925.8610.8617.89INTERNETMean15.2041.1667.2841.73S.D24.7418.3012.119.35S.D15.9830.5422.7521.42Median53.2631.164.7616.07Median8.4134.8972.2440.15Min4.600.471.000.06Min0.220.073.752.57Max81.9655.8246.0437.57Max71.9199.6598.0088.30EMPINDMean13.8323.4323.6120.05EDBMean65.7579.1987.5176.14S.D8.378.215.172.69S.D18.4113.237.9111.58Median10.7922.0421.7419.83Median69.7581.5589.2377.36Min3.4213.6815.8214.07Min16.6515.4856.1543.83Max33.9359.5838.0626.20Max95.1396.6398.3897.301 3Economic Change and Restructuring Table 5  (continued)VariableAfricaAsiaEurLACVariableAfricaAsiaEurLACRIRMean6.474.663.098.80DIMean0.490.430.740.72S.D12.577.204.258.93S.D0.170.230.190.15Median5.454.063.168.08Median0.480.390.850.74Min− 81.13− 20.50− 12.86− 11.60Min0.150.080.260.23Max52.4441.2517.9844.64Max0.790.870.930.92Australia, Canada, and New Zealand merged with Europe Economic Change and Restructuring1 3start-up investments, and remittances from abroad may not provide adequate found-ing resources. Hence, the effect of REM on NLLC is expected to be positive at a low level of ECI and negative at high levels of ECI. Furthermore, we also predict that for HUMI countries, the positive impact of REM on NLLC might not be observed in the data precisely because these countries, on average, are likely to produce highly complex goods and services that require high founding sources that cannot be pro-vided by remittances alone.3.4  Control variablesThe analyzed control variables encompass economic, financial, socio-political, socio-demographic characteristics, along with the international and institutional dimensions. These variables can potentially influence the attractiveness or de-attrac-tiveness of each economy for creating new firms.Within the economic variables, GDPPCGR and GDPPC provide a broad over-view of the economic environment and are anticipated to positively impact the crea-tion of new firms. At a macroeconomic level, SGCF is a crucial variable influenc-ing GDP growth. SGCF can influence investment decisions toward new economic activities and, indirectly, affect the creation of new firms. EMPAGR and EMPIND are economic variables that account for a country’s economic structure. In every country, rates of new business creation differ considerably by sector, and we do not have a priori expectations regarding the impact of these two shares on the creation of new firms.CREDIT serves as a proxy for financial development, with higher levels of finan-cial development expected to facilitate the creation of new firms. Conversely, RIR measures the cost of capital, and it is expected to harm the creation of new firms.The socio-political variables in this study are the voice and accountability index (VAI) and the size of the government index (SGI). These variables reflect the social characteristics of the countries and the government policy environment. The VAI comprises several indicators that measure various aspects of the political process, civil liberties, and political rights. These indicators gauge the extent to which citi-zens can participate in selecting governments. Higher values of VAI are expected to foster a better environment for creating new firms. The SGI is based on general government consumption spending as a percentage of total consumption, transfers and subsidies as a percentage of GDP, government enterprises and investment as a percentage of total investment, and the top marginal tax rate. The effect of this variable is ambiguous since, on the one hand, larger governments may drain private resources that could otherwise be invested in productive activities (including new firms) by the private sector. On the other hand, some public expenditures, such as public infrastructure and education, may benefit a country’s overall productivity and encourage private economic initiatives and the creation of new firms.The socio-demographic variables in this study include HCI and POP. HCI is a synthetic indicator of the average human capital based on the average years of schooling and return to education. We anticipate that this variable will positively 1 3Economic Change and Restructuring impact the creation of new firms. POP should also positively affect the creation of new firms, as it captures the role of a large home market.The variables TRADE, FDIPOP, and INTERNET are associated with the level of country internationalization. TRADE is almost invariably linked to better economic opportunities, including creating new firms; therefore, it is expected to have a posi-tive impact. As for foreign direct investment, they are used in nearly all of the stud-ies mentioned above, but their role needs clarification, as forecasting their effects is more complex.6 According to The World Bank “Foreign direct investment are the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 per cent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor". Therefore, foreign direct investments refer to direct investment equity flows in the reporting economy, and there is no strong reason to believe that they could favor the creation of new firms. Regarding INTERNET, some studies have documented a positive relationship between internet connectivity and aggregate measures of economic progress (Hjort and Tian 2021, p. 17). For example, Cariolle et al. (2019), using a sample of 30 thousand firms, found a positive effect of internet usage on firm performance. Analogously, Hjort and Poulsen (2019) documented a large and significant increase in net firm entry after the arrival of submarine internet cables in South Africa. More generally, Alhassan (2023) found that online services and telecommunication infrastructure positively moderate the association between remittances and entrepreneurship.The variables EDB and DI capture the institutional dimension. EDB is a score that measures the difficulty of starting a business in a country based on the gap between its performance and the regulatory best practices worldwide. A higher score indicates better performance, positively affecting the creation of new firms. EDB also captures the entrepreneurial capacity of entrepreneurs, as well as a business-friendly environ-ment characterized by competitive market factors. DI is a measure of a country’s degree of democracy that attempts to quantify the extent to which the ideal of democracy is achieved. As socially inefficient regulations and rent-seeking activities are less likely to be imposed in democratic countries, it is expected that the higher the DI, the greater the number of new firms. According to World Bank (2014), there is a strong correla-tion between democratic institutions, respect for human rights, and better conditions for business. However, the relationship between democracy and the creation of new firms could be more complex. In this regard, Sima and Huang (2023, p. 2) claim that “the ini-tial condition in terms of economic development is crucial for countries to embark on a path of faster economic growth after democratization”. They find that strong democra-cies (defined as democracies with adequate economic development at transition) grow faster than weak democracies (defined as democracies with poor economic develop-ment at transition).6 Authors (2022), Ajide and Osinubi (2022), and Cummings et al. (2021) find that the estimated coeffi-cient of foreign direct investment either is not significant or, when it is, it has a negative sign. Depending on the specific model, Yavuz and Bahadir (2022) find that it is usually not significant, although some-times they find it positive and statistically significant. In Cummings and Gamlen (2019) and Martinez et al. (2015), the sign is positive but never statistically significant. Finally, Vaaler (2011) finds that for-eign direct investments positively and statistically significantly affect new firms’ creation. Economic Change and Restructuring1 3In concluding this section, it is important to remember that various other coun-try-specific factors influence the creation of new firms, and it is nearly impossible to account for all of them. Including country-fixed effects allows for controlling all time-invariant country-specific factors, which is the best way to handle them econo-metrically. Additionally, dividing the sample into more homogeneous sub-samples is a complementary approach to dealing with the country-specific heterogeneity arising from these unobserved factors. In the empirical analysis, we employ both strategies.3.5  Methodology and econometric specificationOur dependent variable is a count variable that takes on only non-negative integer val-ues and linear regression models are inappropriate since the basic assumptions of the ordinary least squares model are violated leading to biased and inconsistent coefficient estimates. Conversely, count data models such as Poisson and negative binomial are more suitable for our empirical analysis (Allison and Waterman 2002; Cameron and Trivedi 1986). Figures 2, 3, and 4 show that the distribution of NLLC is right-skewed in the total sample and in the different sub-samples we study. In addition, the likeli-hood ratio test LR2 reported for all 
regressions indicates that NLLC is over-dispersed (i.e., the variance is greater than the mean); thus, the Poisson regression model is inap-propriate because the over-dispersion could result in the spurious significance of the coefficient estimates due to underestimated standard errors (Cameron and Trivedi 1986; 2013).7 On the contrary, negative binomial models allow over-dispersion through separate parameterization of the dispersion parameter. Expressed in terms of its log-likelihood function, the negative binomial model takes the following general form:where yit is the dependent variable, x′it is a vector of explanatory variables, possibly including unit and time effects, α is the over-dispersion parameter, β is a vector of coefficients, and Γ is the gamma function. In our study, the dependent variable is the number of new limited liabilities companies ( (NLLCit) , and exp(x′it) corresponds to:where for each country i at time t, the number of new limited liabilities companies is related to real per capita remittances ( REMit−1 ), the economic complexity index (ECIit−1) , their interaction term (REMit−1 × ECIit−1) , and the set of control varia-bles z�it−1 described in Sect. 3.4. To cope with possible reverse causality issues, all explanatory variables are lagged at time t-1. Furthermore, country ( i ) and time ( t ) fixed effects are included.LL =n∑i=1{yit ln( exp(x′it)1 + exp(x′it))− 1ln(1 +  exp(x′it))+ lnΓ(yit +1)− lnΓ(yit + 1)− lnΓ( 1)}exp(0 + 1REMit−1 + 2ECIit−1 + 3(REMit−1 × ECIit−1)+ z�it−1j + i + t)7 The LR1 (p-value) test reported at the bottom of the tables is the probability of the likelihood ratio test statistic on the null hypothesis that all regression coefficients in the model are simultaneously equal to zero.1 3Economic Change and Restructuring As discussed above, we assume that ECI mediates the relationship between NLLC and REM. Thus, finding 𝛽1 > 0 or 𝛽1 < 0 says nothing regarding the impact of real per capita remittances on new firms’ creation. To obtain the effect of REM on NLLC, we must look at the average marginal effect of the former on the latter at dif-ferent levels of ECI. However, to better appreciate this marginal effect, in the follow-ing section, first, we present the regression with the control variables alone; second, we introduce the two main dependent variables without the interaction term; finally, we present the estimate for the complete model.4  Results4.1  Full sample analysisIn this subsection, we will discuss the estimation results and provide a graphical representation of the average marginal effect of REM on NLLC at different centiles of ECI. Table 6 reports the results for the entire sample of countries. Column (1) includes only the control variables, while columns (2) and (3) introduce REM and ECI separately. In column (4), both variables are considered simultaneously, and in column (5), their interaction is added.Table 6 shows that the estimated coefficients of the control variables agree with theoretical expectations. GDPPCGR, TRADE, CREDIT, EOB, POP, HCI, INTER-NET, EMPAGR, EMPIND, and DI have positive estimated coefficients, while RIR’s coefficient is negative. Almost all coefficients are highly statistically significant, up to 1%. On the other hand, the estimated coefficients of GDPPC, FDIPOP, SGCF, VAI, and SGI are not statistically significant. Additionally, the magnitude of these Fig. 2  Frequency distribution of new limited liabilities companies (NLLC) Economic Change and Restructuring1 3coefficients remains stable across all regressions in Table 6, even when ECI, REM, and their interaction are included.Columns (2) and (3) show negative coefficients for both REM and ECI when introduced separately, but only REM in column (2) is statistically significant. The same result is seen in column (4) when they are considered jointly. However, in Panel (a): low and lower-middle-income (LLMI) countriesPanel (b): high and upper-middle-income (HUMI) countriesFig. 3  Frequency distribution of new limited liabilities companies (NLLC)Panel (a) Africa Panel (b) AsiaPanel (c) Europe Panel (d) Latin America and the CaribbeanFig. 4  Frequency distribution of new limited liabilities companies (NLLC)1 3Economic Change and Restructuring column (5), the introduction of their interaction causes the sign of ECI to become positive and the estimate of REM to become statistically insignificant. Interest-ingly, the interaction term is negative and highly statistically significant, indicating an inverse relationship between REM and new firms’ creation as the level of ECI increases. Thus, the impact of real per capita remittances on new firms’ creation depends on the level of the ECI.To better understand this role, Fig. 5 illustrates the (nonlinear) average marginal effect of REM on NLLC at different centiles of ECI (continuous line), with the ver-tical bars representing the 90% confidence interval. As shown, the effect is posi-tive and statistically significant up to the 15th centile. It then becomes insignificant until the 55th centile. Finally, above the 55th centile, the effect of REM on NLLC becomes negative and statistically significant. This finding supports our hypothesis about the role of ECI in the impact of REM on NLLC. Countries with low levels of ECI produce goods and services with new firms that can be established with relatively low initial investments provided by remittances from abroad. Conversely, countries with high levels of ECI produce goods and services with new firms that require high initial investments. In such circumstances, it is unlikely that single remittances alone can provide sufficient resources to start new firms.To understand the practical implications of these results, at the 5th centile of ECI, an increase of real per capita remittances by one dollar would increase the num-ber of new firms by 3069 units. Note that a one-dollar increase in real per capita remittances could represent a significant surge. To provide a concrete example, let us consider Mali, which was at the 5th centile of ECI in the final year of our sample (2020). Mali had a population of approximately 19.1 million in the same year, and real per capita remittances were 0.48 dollars. Therefore, a one-dollar increase in real per capita remittances would represent about a 200% growth, resulting in a $19.2 million increase in total real remittances, which would help create 3069 new firms. In the same year, Mali had a real GDP (constant US dollars) of 15,830 million, and a $19.2 million increase in total real remittances would be equivalent to 0.12% of real GDP.Moving beyond the 5th centile of ECI, at the 10th centile, the number of new firms would increase by 2498, while at the 15th centile, the number of new firms would increase by 1988. No statistically significant effect is observed between the 15th and 55th centile. However, a statistically significant adverse impact is detected above the 55th centile. With a few exceptions (Vietnam, Ukraine, India, and The Philippines), all countries in the negative section of the average marginal effect of REM on NLLC are high-income or upper-middle-income countries, indicating a structural difference between HUMI countries on the one hand, and LLMI coun-tries on the other. More generally, countries differ significantly in political economy, social culture, institutions, traditions, etc. As said above to account for these fac-tors, we included the country’s fixed effects in all regressions, thus controlling for all the time-invariant country-specific factors. Additionally, in the following subsection we partition the sample into relatively more homogeneous sub-samples. Firstly, we split the sample into HUMI and LLMI countries. Secondly, we exploit the regional dimension of our data set and estimate separate regressions for Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean countries.

Columns (1) and (2) consider only the control variables for the two sub-samples of LLMI and HUMI countries. Columns (3) to (6) present the regression results when REM and ECI are introduced sepa-rately, followed by their joint inclusion in columns (7) and (8). Finally, their interac-tion is included in columns (9) and (10). The control variables show the expected signs and are statistically significant most of the time. TRADE, RIR, EMPAGR, and EMPIND are statistically significant in almost all regressions, while others (GDPP-CGR, CREDIT, EOB, HCI, INTERNET, and DI) are significant only for the HUMI sample. In contrast, FDIPOP, POP, and VAI show a statistically significant coef-ficient in the LLMI sample only, while GDPPC, SGCF, and SGI are never statisti-cally significant. These findings suggest a heterogeneous role of these variables in the two sub-samples, reinforcing the validity of our empirical approach, which aims to distinguish the distinct impact of remittances on new firms’ creation based on the countries’ income level.Table 6  (continued)Robust standard errors in parenthesis. *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. Country and year fixed effects included but not reported. LR1 (p-value) is the probability of the likelihood ratio test statistic on the null hypothesis that all regression coefficients in the model are simultaneously equal to zero. LR2 (p-value) is the probability of the likelihood ratio test on the null hypothesis that the log of the dispersion parameter is zero, in which case a Poisson model would be appropriateFig. 5  Average marginal effect of REM on NLLC Economic Change and Restructuring1 3Let us now focus on the primary variables of interest. First, when REM is introduced alone, it has opposite signs in the two sub-samples: a positive impact on NLLC is found for LLMI countries (column 3) and a negative one for HUMI countries (column 4); in both cases, the estimated coefficients are highly statisti-cally significant. Second, ECI correlates negatively with NLLC in LLMI countries (column 5) but is statistically insignificant in the HUMI sample (column 6). Third, these signs and statistical significance patterns are confirmed in columns (7) and (8) when both variables are included in the regressions. Fourth, when the interaction term is added to the LLMI sample, REM and ECI lose their statistical significance, but their interaction is negative and highly statistically significant (column 9). In contrast, in the HUMI sample, all estimated coefficients are statistically significant: REM is negative, ECI is positive, and their interaction is negative.Figure 6 shows the (nonlinear) average marginal effect of REM on NLLC for the two sub-samples, clearly demonstrating the opposite role of real per capita remit-tances in new firm creation for LLMI and HUMI countries. In Panel (a), let us first consider the LLMI sub-sample. REM’s statistically significant positive impact on NLLC is confirmed up to the 65th centile. Above the 65th centile and up to the 90th centile, the estimated impact is not statistically significant. In contrast, beyond the 90th centile, the effect of REM on new firm creation turns out to be negative and slightly statistically significant. As before, we can quantify this effect at differ-ent centiles of ECI for each sub-sample. For example, in LLMI countries, at the median value of ECI =  − 0.7374, an increase of one dollar in real per capita remit-tances would lead to an increase of 5500 new firms (see Panel (a)). Conversely, in the HUMI sub-sample, Panel (b) of Fig. 6 shows that the effect of REM on NLLC, when statistically significant, is negative.In summary, the first step of our sub-sample analysis supports our hypotheses regarding the positive impact of REM on NLLC in LLMI countries and the nega-tive impact of REM on NLLC in HUMI countries on the one hand, and the negative mediating role of ECI in both sub-samples, on the other. This finding aligns with the results of Nguyen et al. (2021), who found that the effects of economic complexity on new firms depend on the country’s economic development levels. Specifically, they found that economic complexity can increase entrepreneurship density in low and middle-income economies but not in high-income ones. Our results also agree with the findings of Nanyiti and Sseruyange (2022), who found that the positive effect of remittances on firms’ density is more robust for LLMI countries and disap-pears for HUMI countries.4.2.2  Regional analysisIn the second step of our sub-sample analysis, we estimate separate regressions for Africa, Asia, Europe,8 and Latin America and the Caribbean. Tables  8 and 9 8 The whole sample includes Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Considering their social, cultural, and economic affinities, we include these three countries in the European sample. We have performed separate regressions excluding them from the European sample, and all the main findings remained unchanged. For the results, see the online Appendix.1 3Economic Change and Restructuring Table 7  Economic complexity index, real remittances, and new firms: low and lower-middle-income (LLMI), high and upper-middle-income (HUMI) countriesLLMIHUMILLMIHUMILLMIHUMILLMIHUMILLMIHUMI(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)REM0.223***− 0.042***0.194***− 0.043***− 0.013− 0.034***(0.080)(0.010)(0.073)(0.011)(0.069)(0.010)ECI− 0.404***0.044− 0.327**0.0870.0080.177*(0.151)(0.086)(0.136)(0.084)(0.097)(0.098)ECI*REM− 0.272***− 0.030**(0.063)(0.013)GDPPCGR 0.0010.009*− 0.0030.010**0.0030.009*− 0.0010.010**0.0050.011**(0.006)(0.005)(0.006)(0.005)(0.006)(0.005)(0.006)(0.005)(0.006)(0.005)GDPPC− 0.118− 0.003− 0.172− 0.005− 0.078− 0.002− 0.136− 0.004− 0.127− 0.004(0.132)(0.009)(0.117)(0.009)(0.135)(0.009)(0.121)(0.009)(0.102)(0.009)SGCF− 0.2170.0780.0920.304− 0.0830.0600.1570.2770.1330.253(0.573)(0.323)(0.493)(0.329)(0.558)(0.321)(0.511)(0.326)(0.460)(0.325)EMPAGR 0.026**0.016*0.024**0.0110.026**0.017*0.024**0.0120.019**0.015(0.013)(0.010)(0.011)(0.009)(0.012)(0.010)(0.011)(0.010)(0.009)(0.010)EMPIND0.063*0.068***0.092***0.060***0.0180.067***0.0530.059***0.0280.062***(0.036)(0.012)(0.035)(0.012)(0.041)(0.013)(0.040)(0.012)(0.036)(0.012)RIR− 0.011***− 0.004− 0.010***− 0.005*− 0.010***− 0.004− 0.010***− 0.005*− 0.011***− 0.005*(0.002)(0.003)(0.002)(0.003)(0.002)(0.003)(0.002)(0.003)(0.002)(0.003)CREDIT− 0.007*0.006***− 0.012***0.005***− 0.0020.006***− 0.0070.005***0.0020.004***(0.004)(0.001)(0.005)(0.001)(0
