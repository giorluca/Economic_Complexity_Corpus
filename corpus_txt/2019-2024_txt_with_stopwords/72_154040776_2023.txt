In this context, eco-innovation has become increasingly important. Nevertheless, countries are heterogeneous in terms of their eco-innovation production. Our study contributes to the understanding of the drivers of eco-innovation by analyzing the determinants of green patent production at the country level. We focus on the specific characteristics of green innovations, namely their complexity and appropriability problem, and explain how these characteristics affect firms’ incentives to produce green in-novations. We then select three external dimensions related to these characteristics and examine how they affect the number of green patents produced. These three dimensions are economic complexity, protection of property rights, and effectiveness of the judicial system. Using the Furman et al. (2001) model as a starting point, this study focuses on green patent production in OECD countries for the period 2007–2016. The results show that economic complexity and intellectual property rights are key determinants of green patent production.   1. Introduction Constant social and political concern about the environment has led to the promotion of activities, processes, products, and services that are environmentally responsible (Díaz-García et al., 2015). As a result, innovation has become a means for achieving sustainability; therefore, it has positioned itself as the center of all environmental development policies. For instance, the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for Germany, which aims to meet the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions targets, addresses five dimensions to achieve this, one of which is research, innovation and competitiveness (Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, 2023a). Environmental innovation helps mitigate the traditional business trade-off between competitiveness and sustainability, thus reducing some of the negative consequences of production activities on ecosystems (Rennings, 2000). Innovation and sustainability are two concepts that, when applied together, may give rise to new markets and, from an academic point of view, to a novel field of study termed “eco-innovation” (Segarra-Oña et al., 2011). Therefore, this study aims to contribute to the integrative approach of Sarpong et al. (2023), which links innovation management and sustainability science. Eco-innovation can be defined as “the production, assimilation or exploitation of a product, production process, service or management or business method that is novel to the organization (developing or adopting it) and which results, throughout its life cycle, in a reduction of environmental risk, pollution and other negative impacts of resources use (including energy use) compared to relevant alternatives” (Kemp and Pearson, 2007, p. 7). Eco-innovation differs from generic innovation because it implies adopting activities that are new for the organization and leads to a reduction in environmental risks and pollution (Kemp and Pearson, 2007). The effects of climate change are becoming increasingly evident, and innovation can play a major role in national and subnational decar-bonization processes (Matos et al., 2022). Thus, the analysis of eco-innovation is gaining special relevance at both political and aca-demic levels (Cainelli et al., 2020; Costantini et al., 2017; Krieger and Zipperer, 2022). First, the Europe 2020 Strategy consolidated environ-mental innovation as a central axis. It articulated smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth as a means of developing an efficient and competitive economy that offers high rates of employment and productivity (Euro-pean Commission, 2010). Currently, Agenda 2023 calls for innovative solutions to accelerate the transition to sustainable societies (UN Envi-ronmental Program, 2023). Second, from an academic point of view, there is growing interest in understanding the production of * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: silvia.donis@unirioja.es (S.

A recent systematic review found that 62.5% of articles addressing sustainable innovation were published between 2012 and 2019 (Cillo et al., 2019). Eco-innovation has an ambidextrous orientation, that is, it manages economic and environment-related activities. The main agent producing this type of innovation is the firm, and its introduction allows a company to minimize the negative effects of its operations on the environment (Rennings, 2000). Some advantages of eco-innovations include the reduction of toxicity in production processes, the reduction of waste emissions and pollution, and savings in the use of materials, energy, water, and soil by increasing the efficiency of inputs or the use of renewable resources (Kammerer, 2009; Przychodzen and Przychodzen, 2015). Therefore, eco-innovations have environmental implications that generic innovations do not. Eco-innovations exhibit a more systemic and complex nature, are more novel, and have a greater impact than generic innovations (De Marchi, 2012; Kemp and Pontoglio, 2011; Barbieri et al., 2020). Similarly, they require heterogeneous knowledge and new resource combinations, possibly to a greater extent than generic in-novations (Ghisetti et al., 2015; Ketata et al., 2015). The need for more diversified knowledge implies eco-innovating firms’ participation in broad collaborative networks (De Marchi, 2012). Cooperation with external agents can generate important appropriability issues for firms that produce eco-innovations. The previous description highlights two important dimensions of eco-innovation that we study in this paper: complexity and appropri-ability. On the one hand, eco-innovations have a complex and systemic character, which results in the involvement of different actors in their production. This suggests the need for the knowledge base on which eco- innovations are produced to be more diverse. Relatedly, in recent years, research in economics has been interested in studying the complexity of countries’ economic activities and their effect on different dimensions such as economic growth, emissions or income inequality (Hidalgo, 2021). In this paper, we argue that economic complexity theory is also important for understanding eco-innovation, as this theory maintains that countries are heterogeneous in terms of the diversity of the products that they produce and this diversity, in turn, is related to the knowledge, skills and capabilities of a country. Therefore, in this study, we link the economic complexity of countries and the production of eco-patents at the country level. On the other hand, the appropriability risks of eco-innovation are explained by the existence of a double externality: (1) the companies that produce it generate knowledge that can spill over to other agents, such as competitors or suppliers and, at the same time, (2) eco- innovations reduce the environmental impact of economic activities, benefiting society in general. This double externality may translate into an appropriability problem, because producers of eco-innovations perceive difficulties in capturing the value resulting from their genera-tion (Beise and Rennings, 2005). The appropriability problem in eco-innovations can be treated as a market failure, which requires external intervention in the form of incentives for eco-innovative agents (Borghesi et al., 2015). Our study, based on institutional theory, focuses on two external factors (intellectual property rights and the effectiveness of the judicial system) to verify whether they can contribute to reduce the appropriability problem and thus support the production of eco-patents. Therefore, in this paper we use economic complexity theory and institutional theory to explain the production of eco-innovations at the country level. We develop three hypotheses that are subsequently tested on data at the country level gathered from multiple public sources. We collected data from the Worldwide Patent Statistical database (PAT-STAT), the International Institute for Management Development (In-ternational Institute for Management Development, 2021) World Competitiveness Report, the World Bank, the Atlas of Economic Complexity, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2022) database, the Global Competitiveness Report and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Develop-ment (OECD,2023) Science & Technology data. This study takes Furman et al. (2001) as the starting point and focuses on the production of green patents in 24 countries belonging to the OECD for the period 2007–2016. The results, using negative binomial regression, reveal that economic complexity and intellectual property rights have a positive effect on the production of eco-patents in advanced countries. This paper makes several important contributions to the study of eco- innovation, particularly with respect to the influences of external factors on the production of eco-patents in developed countries. First, the study offers a novel theoretical perspective on how three external factors - economic complexity, intellectual property rights, and effectiveness of the judicial system - can act as enablers in the production of eco-patents. This unique theoretical argument broadens the understanding of the external influences on eco-innovation, especially in the production of eco-patents. Second, this research provides empirical evidence on the importance of economic complexity in understanding the value creation of eco-innovation in advanced countries. By empirically validating the link between a country’s economic complexity and its ability to generate eco-patents, this study contributes a new dimension to the eco- innovation literature. Similarly, by revealing the positive effect of in-tellectual property rights on eco-innovation, it emphasizes the impor-tance of protecting the value created by eco-innovation. Finally, the paper has implications for policymakers and managers. Regarding the former, two means are suggested, through economic complexity and intellectual property rights, for policymakers to incentivize eco- innovation. Regarding the latter, the results suggest that countries differ in terms of their ability to generate eco-innovations and to capture the value created by them, aspects that must therefore be considered by managers focusing on the production of this type of innovation. This paper is structured as follows. The second section reviews the literature on the external country determinants of eco-innovation. The third section develops the theoretical framework that allows us to pro-pose our hypotheses. The fourth section presents the sample and the variables used. The fifth section presents the results obtained and finally, the sixth section shows the discussion and draws the main conclusions and implications. 2. External country drivers of eco-innovation Concern for the environment is increasingly common among com-panies (Díaz-García et al., 2015) and consumers’ awareness of the environmental impact of their actions is growing (De Marchi, 2012). This has led to the consolidation of eco-innovation as an essential element of economic development, as it allows the decoupling of envi-ronmental pressures and economic growth (Zubeltzu-Jaka et al., 2018). Generally speaking, it is a type of innovation that simultaneously im-proves economic and environmental performance (Costantini and Mazzanti, 2012) and so its production is increasing. PATSTAT data show that green patent activity has been growing steadily, even reaching annual growth rates of 17% in the Netherlands in 2014 or 16% in 2012 in Sweden. Research on the drivers of eco-innovation is very useful for policy makers and managers to promote its adoption (Ghisetti and Pontoni, 2015). Given the particularities of eco-innovation mentioned in the Introduction, it is reasonable to assume that the factors driving its pro-duction are different from those of other types of innovation (De Marchi, 2012), or at least, act with different intensity. It is therefore not sur-prising that much of the research on this topic has been devoted to identifying these determinants. As a result, the study of “eco-innovation drivers” is the most recurring theme in the literature (Cainelli et al., 2015; Ghisetti et al., 2015; Parrilli et al., 2023). These innovations should be seen as processes in which innovative firms themselves are involved, but also encompass external actors, including institutions, infrastructures, and consumer practices (Cillo et al., 2019). Therefore, it S. Donis et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Technovation 128 (2023) 1028683is possible to distinguish between drivers internal to firms and, those that are external to them. In this paper, we focus on the drivers of eco-innovation that are external to the firm. Specifically, we focus on the analysis of certain characteristics of countries may influence the production of eco- innovations. This conditions the literature review that we conduct in this section. In the following paragraphs, we consider the research that has been done on three distinct types of drivers: environmental regu-lation, policy instruments and countries’ financial system. Starting with environmental regulation, it is defined as regulation that may “force” firms to realize environmental innovation (Horbach, 2008) and is considered one of the main drivers of eco-innovation (Hille et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). For instance, Law 138/2013 on renewable sources of energy came into force in 2013 in Albania to promote innovation and new technologies for electricity and heat pro-duction using renewable energy sources (Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, 2023b). The literature sug-gests that one of the reasons for environmental regulation is to reduce of the problem of appropriability (De Marchi, 2012). The appropriability problem is mainly caused by a specific characteristic of eco-innovations, the “double externality” (Rennings, 2000). This double externality means that the production of eco-innovations can give rise to knowledge spillovers. On the one hand, external agents benefit from the in-vestments made by the producer of the eco-innovation, without the latter receiving compensation for it. On the other hand, this type of innovation creates a benefit for society, which the company producing it cannot internalize (Krammer, 2015). Therefore, the incentives to invest in this type of innovation are diminished by the difficulty of capturing the value generated (Ghisetti et al., 2017; Nanda and Kerr, 2015). Peng et al. (2021), Orsatti et al. (2020), Colombelli et al. (2021) and Cecere et al. (2020) confirm that stricter environmental regulations positively influence eco-
innovation. The literature has also investigated different types of regulation (command-and-control, market-based and volun-tary) and their influence on technologies. Some results show that market-based regulation has the greatest impact in the long range, but that the expected results can only be achieved with an appropriate combination of them (Zhang et al., 2021). Policy instruments are defined as the set of governmental techniques that involve the use or limitation of state resources for the purpose of achieving policy objectives (Howlett and Rayner, 2007). In terms of innovation policies, Greco et al. (2022) show that the combined effect of environmental and generic innovation policies on process eco-innovations is stronger than the individual effect of generic inno-vation policies, both in the short and in the long term. The literature on the determinants of eco-innovation distinguishes between two cate-gories of policy instruments: the technology-push and demand-pull types. Technology-push instruments increase scientific and technolog-ical knowledge, while demand-pull ones expand the size of the market (Del Río et al., 2015; Horbach et al., 2012; Hille et al., 2020). Despite their differences, both instruments have been considered drivers of eco-innovation (Costantini et al., 2017). There are studies that argue that market-based (MBIs) or demand-pull instruments, such as taxes or emission permits, are preferable to technology-push ones in the context of eco-innovation. This is because the more pollution is reduced, the greater the number of benefits that MBIs provide, whereas, once the target is reached, technology-push instruments do not incentivize further pollution reduction, because the advantages do not increase (Fabrizi et al., 2018). Li (2022) states that a higher tax on emissions always leads to higher investment in green innovation. However, Frondel et al. (2008) show that MBIs are less effective than technology-push instruments in promoting eco-innovation. Relatedly, Costantini et al. (2017) demonstrate that the impact of different policy instruments does not depend on the type of policy instrument used, but on the degree of technological maturity of the innovation itself. Jové-Llopis and Segarra-Blasco (2020) also show that the influence of market-pull factors differs within subgroups of services. An additional possibility is that the application of both instruments could be comple-mentary (Cantner et al., 2016), although they must be combined in a balanced way (Costantini and Crespi, 2013; Costantini et al., 2015, 2017). In fact, this had generated a debate in some countries. For instance, Germany started with a strong emphasis on demand pull measures, however their high associated costs gave rise to a contro-versial debate on whether a balance between push and pull instruments in Germany’s policy mix would have allowed them to achieve their objectives more cost-effectively (Nuñez-Jimenez et al., 2022). The literature on the external drivers of eco-innovation has also paid attention to the role of the national financial system. The national financial system represents the institutions and markets responsible for carrying out financial transactions and the exchange of money between lenders and borrowers (Babu, 2018). For example, the climate risk stress test conducted by the Bank of England’s UK financial system can support the development of sustainable initiatives (Carney, 2019). Therefore, the national financial system is a relevant factor in promoting eco-innovation, as it can mobilize large amounts of funds and allocate them to innovative environmental projects (Olmos et al., 2012) or to address their financial obstacles (Cecere et al., 2014). The financial component is relevant to environmental innovation and has been re-flected in several analyses through: foreign direct investment inflows and remittances in developing countries (Li et al., 2018; Farooq, 2023; Khan et al., 2020), access to public funds and tax incentives (Cecere et al., 2020; Sánchez-Sellero and Bataineh, 2022), green subsidies (Hu et al., 2021) and governments’ direct financial expenditure on envi-ronmental protection (Long and Liao, 2022). This brief literature review highlights the interest in understanding the role of different external factors, focusing on country characteristics, in the production of eco-innovations. Our study aims to contribute to this literature by analysing the role of complexity and institutional theories in the production of eco-innovations. As we show below, the addition of these two theories is relevant for understanding value cre-ation and value appropriation in eco-innovations and thus for incen-tivizing the production of eco-innovations. First, we consider the role of the diversity of a country’s knowledge base, captured by its economic complexity. Second, we explore the role of institutional theory, focusing on the role of intellectual property and the effectiveness of the legal system in appropriating the value created by eco-innovations. 3. Theoretical framework and hypotheses Value creation and value appropriation are two different dimensions, but both influence a company’s ability to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Value creation from innovation activities is the value created by the innovation itself and determines the potential for competitive advantage. Value appropriation refers to the firm’s ability to capture the value created by the innovation and affects the compet-itive advantage achieved by the firm (Teece, 1986). Therefore, in addition to seeking novel ways to create value, innovative firms also strive to appropriate the value of innovation activities. Since innovating involves high costs, these firms will only have incentives to incur them if they see the possibility of capturing at least part of the rents from innovation, so that they can recoup their investment and earn a return in excess of the opportunity costs (Arrow, 1962). As mentioned in the Introduction, eco-innovations have two char-acteristics that have a significant influence on firms’ incentives to invest in their production: the greater complexity and the appropriability problem. The first characteristic mainly influences the production of eco-innovations and, therefore, the creation of value. The second, however, is more related to the capture of the value derived from eco- innovation. We argue that these two attributes make eco-innovations more sensitive to certain characteristics of the environment in which firms operate. Specifically, in our hypotheses we relate the first of these attributes to the economic complexity of countries. Similarly, we argue that the second characteristic of eco-innovation makes eco-innovations S. Donis et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Technovation 128 (2023) 1028684more sensitive to two features of the formal institutional environment, namely, intellectual property rights and the effectiveness of the judicial system. Hence, we integrate economic complexity theory (Hidalgo, 2021) and institutional theory (North, 1990) to explain value creation and value appropriation in countries’ eco-innovations. Economic complexity theory builds on Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009)’s measurement of this dimension, which captures country ca-pabilities and predicts future growth. Hidalgo (2021) reviews its appli-cations and analyses its relationship with variations in countries’ income, economic growth, emissions and economic inequality. This relationship can also be extended to the literature on innovation. Those economies with greater economic complexity would have a greater potential to find combinations of factors that could become valuable innovations. As we argue below, the fact that eco-innovations require a greater variety of inputs makes economic complexity an even more relevant factor in their production. Our analysis contributes to the emerging literature relating countries’ economic complexity to CO2 emissions or environmental performance (Boleti et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Mealy and Teytelboym, 2022; Romero and Gramkow, 2021) and presents a mechanism through which these relationships can be explained. In this paper, we also argue that the characteristics of the institu-tional environment in which firms carry out their activities influence the production of eco-innovations through their impact on the ability of firms to appropriate the value created. Teece (1986) argues that inno-vative firms tend not to obtain significant economic returns and explains this based on three factors: the appropriability regime, the possession of complementary assets and the dominant design paradigm. Thus, the appropriability regime is one of the main factors determining a com-pany’s propensity to innovate (Dosi et al., 2006). It encompasses a set of environmental factors that reflect the innovator’s ability to capture the benefits generated. The dimensions included in the appropriability regime are the nature of the technology and the effectiveness of legal protection mechanisms (Teece, 1986). We focus on the latter dimension through institutional theory, which has gained special relevance in the eco-innovation literature (see, for example, Zhang et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022 or Xie et al., 2023). Institutional theory explains innovative behaviour through external pressures and social expectations (Cai and Li, 2018), which can make environmental innovation more attractive (Berrone et al., 2013) and encourage firms to initiate eco-innovations (Dong et al., 2022). North (1990) distinguishes between formal in-stitutions (laws, regulations and rules) and informal institutions (norms, culture and ethics). In terms of eco-innovations, both types of in-stitutions influence eco-innovation (Lubacha and Wendler, 2021; Orlando et al., 2020), but they seem to be more sensitive to legal pro-tection mechanisms. We focus our attention on the two formal in-stitutions that we believe may have a more direct relationship with the appropriability of value derived from eco-innovation, which are intel-lectual property rights and the effectiveness of the judicial system. 3.1. Economic complexity To study the drivers of eco-innovation, it is useful to focus on the characteristics of eco-innovations. Among these, the greater complexity of eco-innovations, as opposed to generic innovations, stands out (see, for example, Chaparro-Banegas et al., 2023; or Kemp and Pontoglio, 2011). Different studies have analysed the complexity of eco-innovations, using the firm as the unit of analysis (see, for example, De Marchi, 2012, or Ghisetti et al., 2015). Complexity captures the variety of knowledge, components and competencies required to develop a new technology (Lerner, 1994). Barbieri et al. (2020) argue that the complexity of this type of innovation is reflected in the variety of knowledge sources and technological components used, requiring a more complex knowledge recombination. For example, this need for diverse knowledge leads family firms not to participate in inter-firm R&D networks when technological relatedness is high (Ardito et al., 2019b). In other words, firms wishing to eco-innovate seek knowledge in terms of breadth and depth (Ghisetti et al., 2015). The complexity of eco-innovations leads firms to combine different activities (Abadzhiev et al., 2022): systemic innovation by proactive innovators, process innovation by reactive innovators and inaction by technology-independent actors. It is therefore clear how external knowledge promotes sustainability (Kobarg et al., 2020) and is a driver of eco-innovation (see, for example, Ghisetti et al., 2015; Ben Amara and Chen, 2020; or Chistov et al., 2021). There are significant differences between countries in terms of their technological domains and only some of them possess the necessary competences to invest in complex technologies (Pugliese et al., 2017). Countries need to keep a diverse range of knowledge available to enable them to produce a diversity of more technologically sophisticated and innovative products (Hausmann et al., 2014). Knowledge is the basis of inventive activity (Fleming and Sorenson, 2001; Horbach et al., 2012) and precisely, technology breadth has a positive effect on the techno-logical development in the green energy sector (Ardito et al., 2019a) and the recombination of diverse knowledge enables the creation of green energy techniques with greater impact (Ardito et al., 2016). Thus, those countries with a more diverse knowledge base will be more likely to produce eco-innovations and thus contribute to their value creation. Economic complexity theory establishes that a way to capture such knowledge diversity at the country level is represented by the economic complexity index of countries, which has received increasing attention in recent years (Hidalgo, 2021). It is defined as the diversity of the ca-pabilities of the country and its interactions. Economic complexity can serve as a measure of a society’s knowledge (Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009). This dimension has been directly related to the production of innovations, because countries with higher economic complexity export more technologically sophisticated products (Balland et al., 2022). In this line, Mealy and Teytelboym (2022) suggest that countries with a larger capacity to export complex green products have higher rates of green patents, produce lower CO2 emissions and have stricter environ-mental policies. Romero and Gramkow (2021) conclude that complex economies tend to produce goods more efficiently, reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity and per capita emissions. Boleti et al. (2021) point out that economic complexity leads to greater product sophisti-cation, improving environmental performance and Li et al. (2023) showed that the moderating effect of eco-innovation with the economic complexity index leads to a decrease in carbon emissions. According to OECD data and Atlas of Economic Complexity, Chile and Colombia are above average in pollution levels among OECD countries and have low rates of economic complexity. We argue that countries with higher economic complexity maintain a greater diversity of expertise, leading them to produce a more hetero-geneous and sophisticated variety of goods, and thus more complex products, than other countries with lower degrees of economic complexity (Hidalgo, 2021). As discussed above, eco-innovations are a more complex and novel type of innovation than non-eco-innovations, thus requiring a greater diversity of expertise (Ghisetti et al., 2015; Ketata et al., 2015). Therefore, we seek to contribute to this literature and we expect eco-innovation to critically depend on the economic complexity of the activities surrounding the firm, becoming an instru-ment for its value creation. Accordingly, we propose the following as our first hypothesis. Hypothesis 1. National economic complexity positively influences the production of green patents. 3.2. Intellectual property rights Protection mechanisms usually included in the definition of property rights are patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as utility and industrial models (Burrone, 2005). These instruments can grant inventors monopoly rights over the commercial activity of their S. Donis et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Technovation 128 (2023) 1028685innovations (Krammer, 2015). These protection mechanisms are considered barriers to the imitation of new products and processes and, consequently, support mechanisms for those who invest in innovation (Rumelt, 1984). The literature usually organizes these mechanisms into two groups, so that two types of appropriation strategies can be configured (Colombelli et al., 2021): formal ones, which include intel-lectual property rights, such as patents or trademarks, and informal ones, such as trade secrets or the use of complementary assets. In this paper, we use 
institutional theory by focusing on intellectual property rights and their effects on the production of eco-patents, so the discussion is centred, fundamentally, on this mechanism. Patents are a type of formal intellectual protection mechanism and have traditionally been considered the most effective instrument of appropriation (Fried-man et al., 1991). According to Evers (1994), a patent is a legal docu-ment that grants its holder the exclusive right to exploit the invention in each country where a patent has been applied for. Patents determine the degree of appropriability of the inventor, i.e., they delimit the creator’s ability to capture the benefits derived from the innovation (Barbosa and Faria, 2011). Many countries have opted for strict patent protection laws, as they stimulate the growth and development of companies, enhance reputation, impose barriers to imitation, incentivize research, create technology and disseminate information safely, all while guar-anteeing the inventor’s monopoly for a limited time (Barbosa and Faria, 2011; Colombelli et al., 2021; Edquist, 1997; Furukawa, 2007). Intellectual property laws establish what can be patented, as well as how patents are granted and their scope, in addition to the rights of inventors and the duration of these rights (Henry and Stiglitz, 2010). The literature considers intellectual property rights an incentive for innovation (Chesbrough and Crowther, 2006; Dosi et al., 2006), specially, for countries with a high capacity to produce large volumes of patents (Sharma et al., 2022). Indeed, much of the literature considers the quality of the intellectual property regime to be the most obvious form of institutional protection and an indispensable condition for capturing the benefits of innovation (Dosi et al., 2006; Hurmaleinna--Laukkanen and Puumalainen, 2007). Furthermore, Hall et al. (2010) show that weak intellectual property rights lead to the non-appropriation of innovation returns, causing losses in innovative activities. Similarly, Athreye et al. (2020) argue that the difficulty in capturing the benefits of innovations results in lower research and development (R&D) investment. Therefore, to the extent that the strength of intellectual property rights differs between countries, the incentives for firms to produce green patents will also be different. Empirical evidence on ownership mechanisms in sustainable inno-vation is scarce (Vimalnath et al., 2022) and we need to know the impact of IPRs on the development and diffusion of sustainable innovations (Eppinger et al., 2021). Ensuring the appropriability of the results through the regulation of intellectual property rights for the companies that produce them may be more critical than for other types of inno-vation due to the double externality discussed above. Expansionary monetary policies, supported by strong property rights protection, favour green innovation activities in developing countries (Yin et al., 2022). In a study of Chinese provinces, it was found that those with better intellectual property protection could more effectively fight cor-ruption, allowing the development of green technology to a greater extent (Nie et al., 2023). Through a sample of South Korean companies, Roh et al. (2021) considered intellectual property rights as a knowledge-based competence and showed their positive effect on green innovation. Across a sample of 52 green innovations developed in OECD countries, it was observed that semi-open intellectual property strategies (non-exclusive licensing and collaboration in particular) for the pro-tection of these innovations are chosen by 50% of the sample (Vimalnath et al., 2020). In a sample for sustainable manufacturing industries, in-tellectual property rights support organizations in their sustainable ac-tivity in a structural way (Eppinger et al., 2021). Considering that effectiveness of patent protection is determined by the way in which these patent rights are defined, a more complete definition will make patent protection more effective and provide a clearer incentive for eco-innovation. Conversely, if intellectual property rights are more vaguely defined, this will make ownership more difficult and reduce the incentive for companies to eco-innovate. In other words, given these arguments and the nature of eco-innovations (including the diversity of knowledge, which often requires collaboration, the double externality and the uncertainty), the strength of intellectual property rights protection is an element that should determine the quantity of green patents produced in a country, as it reduces the uncertainty regarding the firm’s ability to appropriate rents. When the strength of intellectual property rights is high, firms more clearly perceive the possibility of appropriating the value of their eco-innovations, i.e., the problem of appropriability is reduced and, therefore, we expect that in these environments the production of green patents will increase. Consequently, in our second hypothesis we propose that. Hypothesis 2. The strength of intellectual property rights in a country positively influences the production of green patents. 3.3. Effectiveness of the judicial system Continuing with the institutional theory, we also argue that the appropriation of value from eco-innovation depends fundamentally on how intellectual property rights are enforced. More specifically, we propose that the production of green patents depends on the effective-ness of the judicial system. The quality of the judicial system has been positively related to R&D investment and economic growth (Seitz and Watzinger, 2016). Comin and Hobijn (2009) point out that if the judicial system is not effective, new technologies will replace old ones more slowly. Yang (2017) argues that a fair judicial system is positively associated with innovative firms. Consequently, for protection mechanisms and other legal instruments to promote innovation, it is necessary to have a reliable and effective judicial system, and one that is composed of clear, strict, and rigorous rules, to ensure that innovators can appropriate the results obtained. A country’s institutional policy can implement optimal legal protection mechanisms that promote innovation, but if its judicial system is not effective or reliable, it will not provide sufficient security and certainty in innovation projects. If this is the case, innovators may decide to move their production to countries where the effectiveness of the judicial system is higher (Rosenbuch et al., 2019). Improvements in institutional quality would reduce CO2 emissions, improving environmental quality (Khan et al., 2021). In a sample of developing countries, a 1% increase in institutional quality reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 0.313% (Ali et al., 2019). Moreover, legitimacy generates comfort around efforts to diffuse green innovations (Gharib et al., 2022) and conversely, environmental innovation also improves legitimacy positions (Berrone et al., 2013). An effective judi-cial system requires the integration of different methods of conflict resolution that guarantee citizens access to swift, legitimate and effec-tive justice (López-Barajas, 2012). In the resolution of judicial conflicts, companies rely on the correct execution of contracts, the protection of property rights and the performance of the police and the courts (Bar-bosa and Faria, 2011). An effective judicial system provides security and guarantee in police, judicial and correctional procedures, i.e., it ensures the correct performance of legal protection mechanisms and, conse-quently, ensures the appropriation of benefits from eco-innovation. The effectiveness of the judicial system is related to less institutional cor-ruption (Leitao, 2016), which will promote green technological inno-vation due to decreased uncertainty (Nie et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023). Tebaldi and Elmslie (2013) show that the degree of efficiency of the judicial system explains part of the variation in patenting across coun-tries. The judicial system strengthens or weakens the ability of investors to appropriate the value created by their innovation activities. In the same vein, Teece (1986) argues that the nature of the technology and the effectiveness of the legal protection mechanism are the key dimensions S. Donis et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Technovation 128 (2023) 1028686of an appropriability regime. Based on these arguments, eco-innovations present a series of characteristics (having a systematic and complex nature as well as more risky and uncertain benefits, in addition to frequently being produced in wide collaborative networks) that suggest the need for an effective judicial system. This means that eco-innovators perceive that they are more likely to capture the value of their in-vestments in cases where the judicial system is effective in allowing them to appropriate the returns on their investment. Consequently, we propose the following as our third hypothesis. Hypothesis 3. The effectiveness of the judicial system positively in-fluences the production of green patents. 4. Empirical analysis 4.1. Sample and data The literature has identified three ways to measure eco-innovation: questionnaire-based surveys, R&D expenditures and patent informa-tion (Kemp and Pearson, 2007). Patents have become a common mea-sure of innovation (Acs et al., 2002), because they provide disaggregated information on each invention and its inventor (Perruchas et al., 2020), are public documents (Archibugi and Pianta, 1996) and are often filed during the research process, acting as a good indicator of development and research activities (Griliches, 1990). Moreover, unlike R&D ex-penditures, patent data are available for many countries and over a long period of time (Costantini and Mazzanti, 2012), making excellent quantitative analyses possible (Costantini et al., 2017) and making its application quite simple (Archibugi and Pianta, 1996). However, using patents as a measure of innovation also has several drawbacks. First, most innovations are not patented, because they are not patentable, or because the inventor decides to protect their inventions with other methods, such as trade secrets or utility models (Costantini and Maz-zanti, 2012). Other drawbacks are the wide variation in the quality of patents depending on the product to which they are linked (Griliches, 1990) and the different propensity of firms to patent (Archibugi and Pianta, 1996). Despite the above limitations, patents are still considered a suitable resource for analysing the process of technological change, mainly because of the ease of access to data and their availability over long periods of time (Griliches, 1990). Consequently, and following the idea that patents are the only observable manifestation of inventive activity with a strong universal basis (Furman et al., 2001), we have taken green patents as the unit of measurement for green innovation (see, for example, Ardito et al., 2016; Ardito et al., 2019a; Ardito et al., 2019b or Berrone et al., 2013). Our starting empirical model for explaining patent production at the country level is the model of Furman et al. (2001). In our case, we augment the model proposed by these authors with the variables measuring the three hypotheses raised above. The data used in the analysis come mainly from the PATSTAT database, which contains information on patents worldwide and is published by the European Patent Office (EPO) (European Patent Office, 2017). Other sources used in the measurement of the independent and control variables are the IMD World Competitiveness Report, data from the World Bank, the Atlas of Economic Complexity, the UNESCO data-base, the Global Competitiveness Report (Global Competitiveness Report, 2022) and the OECD Science & Technology data. Our analysis focuses on a sample of OECD countries and on the period 2007–2016. In addition, we have eliminated those countries with observations for less than four years .1 The focus on the OECD region is interesting because it has been a pioneer in promoting green growth and has made the growth strategy an essential part of its policy framework (OECD, 2020). Ahmad and Wu (2022) consider the OECD region as a representative laboratory for the rest of the industrialized world in the study of sustainable development. Besides, OECD region has seen an increase in its carbon footprint since 2000, particularly due to transportation and energy use (Indicators, 2019) and this region has implemented many policies to improve environmental quality over the past two decades. Environmental knowledge and awareness among both policymakers and society are lower in emerging economies as well (Horbach, 2016), which is related to our first hypothesis. In turn, research on eco-innovations in developed economies is scarce (Horbach, 2016; Stojčić, 2021), and our sample is mainly from advanced economies. 4.2. Description of variables 4.2.1. Dependent variables According to Trajtenberg (1990), patents are the only observable manifestation of inventive activity with a universal character, so this instrument may reasonably reveal the eco-innovative capacity of a country, making it possible to study its dependence on economic complexity, intellectual property rights and the effectiveness of the judicial system. As mentioned, to measure eco-innovation we use the number of green patents produced by each country. Green patents are the set of technologies that have the potential to reduce environmental problems (Cohen et al., 2021). Green technologies, and consequently green patents, have a lower environmental impact than their non-green alternatives (OECD, 2011). Data on green patents have been extracted from PATSTAT, which is published by the EPO. To determine the patents that are related to the environment, the Cooperative Patent Classification is used. Specifically, green patents are represented through the Y02 group “Technologies or applications for mitigation or adaptation against climate change” (De Cunzo, et al., 2022), which presents eight types of green patents: Y02A “Climate change adaptation technologies”, Y02B “Climate change mitigation technologies related to buildings”, Y02C “Capture, storage, sequestration or removal of greenhouse gases”, Y02D “Climate change mitigation technologies in information and communication technolo-gies”, Y02E “Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to the generation”, Y02P “Climate change mitigation technologies in the pro-duction or transformation of goods”, Y02T “Climate change mitigation technologies related to transport” and Y02W “Climate change mitigation technologies related to wastewater treatment or waste management”. 4.2.2. Independent variables The information to measure our independent variables is collected from three sources (see Table 1 for details): the Atlas of Economic Complexity, the IMD World Competitiveness Report and the World Bank (World Bank, 2023). Economic complexity. The information used to measure Economic complexity comes from the Atlas of Economic Complexity. The variable we use is an index based on the idea that countries with a wide range of knowledge can produce a wide range of goods. This index is calculated from the diversity of exports produced by a country and their ubiquity (the number of countries capable of producing them) (Atlas of Economic Complexity, 2021). This variable is calculated for each country and is a continuous variable that takes values below 0 when the country pro-duces a diversity of goods lower than the average of countries and above 0 when the diversity of activities performed is higher than the average. Since economic complexity reflects the presence of extensive knowledge and the incorporation of more sophisticated activities, it is expected to have a positive and significant effect on the production of green patents. Intellectual property rights. To assess the effect of intellectual property rights on patent production, we use the Intellectual property rights variable. This variable was obtained from the IMD Global 1 Australia, 
Costa Rica, France, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, South Korea, Turkey and the United States were the countries eliminated. The final sample consists of 24 countries. S. Donis et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Technovation 128 (2023) 1028687Competitiveness Report and is calculated as an average of the responses received in its opinion survey of business executives. This index reflects the opinion of business executives on the adequate enforcement of in-tellectual property rights, on a scale of 0–10. It is expected that with more adequate enforcement of intellectual property rights, the number of green patents produced will increase. Effectiveness of the judicial system. We measure the Effectiveness of the judicial system using information on the speed with which court cases are resolved. This measure has been used in other studies. For example, Marciano et al. (2018) consider that the time it takes to resolve a case from the time it is filed by a plaintiff is the main measure of the efficiency of the judicial system. Because it is measured in days or years, it is a highly intuitive measure. Authors such as Jappelli et al. (2005) or Safavian and Sharma (2007) also use this measure to refer to judicial efficiency. Therefore, we calculate this variable taking into account the time needed to enforce a contract, from the moment the case is filed with the relevant court until the final decision. The data used are the same as those used by Marciano et al. (2018) in their analysis and come from the World Bank. To make the interpretation of this variable more intuitive, i. e., a positive coefficient means that the efficiency of the judicial system positively affects the production of green patents, we calculated the inverse of this variable. That is, the variable finally used is calculated as 1 divided by the number of days needed to obtain a court decision. 4.2.3. Control variables To complete the specification of our empirical model, it is essential to control for the effect of other variables that can affect a country’s innovative capacity. Our starting point for the specification of the empirical model is the work of Furman et al. (2001) (hereafter, the FPS model), with which these authors attempt to explain national innovative capacity. It is important to note that the FPS model uses the number of patents as the dependent variable, as in our case. We augment this model by including variables related to the three hypotheses tested in this paper. Table 2 defines all the control variables and details the source from which they were collected. Next, we explain the FPS model and define the control variables that we will include in the main analyses. Furman et al. (2001) present an empirical model of national inno-vative capacity. This model presents the main determinants of national patent production for OECD countries. National innovative capacity is defined as a country’s ability to produce and commercialize a stream of new technologies for the world in the long run. The FPS model proposes that national innovative capacity depends on three types of factors and, in doing so, attempts to integrate three perspectives on the sources of innovation. The first set of factors captures the strength of a nation’s common infrastructure, i.e., the set of cross-cutting factors that contribute to innovation. It includes a country’s overall science and technology policy environment, support mechanisms for basic research, higher education and the accumulated stock of technological knowledge.  • The first variable in this group measures a country’s capacity to transform knowledge into a realized state of economic development. As in the FPS model, we measure this variable through GDP per capita, introduced in natural logarithm. We expect that the higher the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the greater the number of green patents produced.  • Second, the level of capital and labour resources devoted to the production of ideas is measured through the number of full-time scientists and engineers (R&D personnel), entered in natural loga-rithm, and the gross expenditure on R&D (R&D expenditures). As in the FPS model, in the presence of a larger endowment of labour and capital resources we expect an increase in the number of green patents.

Technovation 128 (2023) 1028688• The common infrastructure also includes national policies that in-fluence innovation. In this sense, our model introduces the percent-age of GDP allocated to secondary and tertiary education (Advanced education) to measure the intensity of investment in human capital. The stringency of antitrust policies (Antitrust policies) and openness to international trade and investment (Openness) are also included. We expect that the greater the openness to international trade and the more effective the antitrust policies, the higher the number of green patents produced. The same could be expected for the intensity of investment in human capital, which we expect to have a positive effect as well. Although the common innovation infrastructure sets the context for innovation in an economy, the innovation environment of the clusters will also influence national innovative capacity, as it is firms that develop and commercialize innovation (Furman et al., 2001). Under-standing the relationship between the innovative activity of industries and nations has helped to provide insight into the impact of technology on national innovation systems (Archibugi and Pianta, 1996). Never-theless, as Furman et al. (2001) state, this effect is difficult to measure and, following their model, we include two variables: Private R&D and Specialization. We expect both to positively influence the production of green patents.  • To measure the importance of innovation-based competition across clusters, we include a variable that captures the percentage of R&D activity financed by companies (Private R&D). This factor reflects the intention of private companies to direct their resources towards innovation.  • The second variable is Specialization, which acts as a measure of a country’s technological concentration, serving as an indicator of the intensity of competition in terms of innovation in a country’s clus-ters. This variable reflects the relative concentration of patents granted in a country in three technology classes: chemical, electrical and mechanical. For this purpose, it uses the number of patents granted by the EPO. In this way, this variable captures the dynamics of clusters and the specialization of national economies in these fields. Its measurement, through the Ellison-Glaeser concentration indicator, makes it possible to adjust the data for each country/year to the average proportion of these patents in the whole sample and to the total number of patents in each country/year. This is a noisy but useful and unbiased average, which makes it possible to analyse the innovative environment of a country. Because the relationship between common infrastructure and in-dustrial clusters is reciprocal, it is necessary to analyse their linkage. Therefore, the third group of variables represents the relationship be-tween the first and the second set of factors, i.e., between common innovation infrastructure and industrial clusters. For this purpose, the model considers two mechanisms of science and technology transfer, which may have a positive relationship with the production of green patents.  • The first variable is the percentage of R&D spending by a country’s higher education institutions (R&D universities). University research allows for the exchange of ideas between different participants in research projects. Moreover, universities are more able to mobilize common resources.  • The second variable in this third group is the availability of funding from Venture capital. It has been calculated through the average of the responses received in the survey of business executives’ opinions. It reflects the views of business executives on the extent to which venture capital is easily available for business. This factor captures the degree of availability of venture capital to convert scientific re-sults into national innovation opportunities. Geographical dummies. Following Barbieri et al. (2020), we define dummy variables representing different geographical areas: Europe, North America, and South America. Time dummies. Finally, we include Time dummies to assess possible time differences in the production of green patents. 5. Results In Table 3 we report the descriptive statistics and the correlations between the variables considered in the model. The dependent variable is a discrete variable, i.e., it cannot take any value between two consecutive integer values and, moreover, it cannot take negative values. Considering these two peculiarities, we assume that it follows a Poisson distribution. However, the descriptive statistics show that the mean is not equal to the variance, so the results will be estimated using negative binomial regression. Negative binomial regression allows measurement with overdispersion, i.e., in cases where the variance is greater than the mean (Blundell et al., 1995). The Wooldridge (2002) test has been performed. The hypothesis of no serial correlation is rejected; therefore, the model presents problems of serial correlation. It must be controlled, and for this, clustered errors by countries are included in all models (Stock and Mark, 2006). We will therefore comment on the results based on the negative binomial method (Table 4). The first column presents our baseline model, which includes the control variables. Columns 2, 3 and 4 include, respectively, the effect of the variables corresponding to our three hy-potheses individually: Economic complexity, Intellectual property rights and Effectiveness of the judicial system. Column 5 includes the variables corresponding to hypothesis 1 and 2 jointly and finally, column 6 shows the model with the three independent variables. In all the cases, a three- year lag is imposed between the independent and control variables, and the production of green patents, to reduce potential endogeneity prob-lems caused by simultaneity (Furman et al., 2001). We can appreciate that in columns 2–4, where the independent variables are included individually, the results show that all our inde-pendent variables (Economic complexity, Intellectual property rights and Effectiveness of the judicial system) have a significant positive relationship with the production of green patents. Nevertheless, the results of the F- tests, presented at the bottom of Table 4, reveal that the model including the first two independent variables is the preferred one, which is without introducing the Effectiveness of the judicial system. Therefore, we will focus our comments on the results presented in column 5. Hypothesis 1 states that Economic complexity positively influences the production of Green patentst+3. Column 5 shows that Economic complexity is positive and significant (β = 1.811; p < 0.01). This result provides support for Hypothesis 1 and confirms that the economic complexity of the country positively influences the production of green patents. Hy-pothesis 2 posits that Intellectual property rights will positively impact the number of green patents produced in a country. The results presented in column 5 demonstrate that the coefficient of Intellectual property rights protection is positive and significant (β = 0.336; p < 0.05). This outcome supports Hypothesis 2 and affirms that the intellectual property rights positively affect the production of green patents. However, the estima-tions do not support Hypothesis 3, which argues that the Effectiveness of the judicial system on Green patentst+3 is positive. In conclusion, the results of the preferred model suggest that the first two hypotheses receive the support that we expected. 5.1. Robustness tests In this section (Table 5), we test the robustness of the results by performing some additional estimations in which we use alternative measures of green patent production and augment the model FPS with three factors (we focus on the preferred models). Columns 1–4 are estimates with alternative measures to green patent production. The first specification of the model (column 1) responds to a S. Donis et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Technovation 128 (2023) 1028689concern related to the dependent variable: it is possible that an invention has generated several patents because they have been published at varying times or in different countries. To address this issue, we estimate the model using patent families as the dependent variable. Patent fam-ilies allow us to collect the set of patent documents for the same tech-nology (EPO, 2017). Perruchas et al. (2020) and Barbieri et al. (2020) use this variable to analyse eco-innovation (GP familiest+3). Data on patent families have been collected by Green-Tech, whose main data source is PATSTAT 2016 (Perruchas et al., 2020). As second robustness test (column 2), we eliminate the three-year lag in the explanatory variables. Third, green patents include technologies of a different na-ture, namely those dedicated to climate change adaptation and those aimed at climate change mitigation. Column 3 takes as the dependent variable gr
