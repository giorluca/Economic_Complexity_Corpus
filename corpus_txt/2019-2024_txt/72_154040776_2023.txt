Introduction Constant social political concern environment led promotion activities , processes , products , services environmentally responsible ( Díaz-García et al. , 2015 ) . result , innovation become means achieving sustainability ; therefore , positioned center environmental development policies . instance , Integrated National Energy Climate Plan Germany , aims meet EU ’ greenhouse gas emissions targets , addresses five dimensions achieve , one research , innovation competitiveness ( Grantham Research Institute Climate Change Environment , 2023a ) . Environmental innovation helps mitigate traditional business trade-off competitiveness sustainability , thus reducing negative consequences production activities ecosystems ( Rennings , 2000 ) . Innovation sustainability two concepts , applied together , may give rise new markets , academic point view , novel field study termed “ eco-innovation ” ( Segarra-Oña et al. , 2011 ) . Therefore , study aims contribute integrative approach Sarpong et al . ( 2023 ) , links innovation management sustainability science . Eco-innovation defined “ production , assimilation exploitation product , production process , service management business method novel organization ( developing adopting ) results , throughout life cycle , reduction environmental risk , pollution negative impacts resources use ( including energy use ) compared relevant alternatives ” ( Kemp Pearson , 2007 , p. 7 ) . Eco-innovation differs generic innovation implies adopting activities new organization leads reduction environmental risks pollution ( Kemp Pearson , 2007 ) . effects climate change becoming increasingly evident , innovation play major role national subnational decar-bonization processes ( Matos et al. , 2022 ) . Thus , analysis eco-innovation gaining special relevance political aca-demic levels ( Cainelli et al. , 2020 ; Costantini et al. , 2017 ; Krieger Zipperer , 2022 ) . First , Europe 2020 Strategy consolidated environ-mental innovation central axis . articulated smart , sustainable , inclusive growth means developing efficient competitive economy offers high rates employment productivity ( Euro-pean Commission , 2010 ) . Currently , Agenda 2023 calls innovative solutions accelerate transition sustainable societies ( UN Envi-ronmental Program , 2023 ) .

Eco-innovation ambidextrous orientation , , manages economic environment-related activities . main agent producing type innovation firm , introduction allows company minimize negative effects operations environment ( Rennings , 2000 ) . advantages eco-innovations include reduction toxicity production processes , reduction waste emissions pollution , savings use materials , energy , water , soil increasing efficiency inputs use renewable resources ( Kammerer , 2009 ; Przychodzen Przychodzen , 2015 ) . Therefore , eco-innovations environmental implications generic innovations . Eco-innovations exhibit systemic complex nature , novel , greater impact generic innovations ( De Marchi , 2012 ; Kemp Pontoglio , 2011 ; Barbieri et al. , 2020 ) . Similarly , require heterogeneous knowledge new resource combinations , possibly greater extent generic in-novations ( Ghisetti et al. , 2015 ; Ketata et al. , 2015 ) . need diversified knowledge implies eco-innovating firms ’ participation broad collaborative networks ( De Marchi , 2012 ) . Cooperation external agents generate important appropriability issues firms produce eco-innovations . previous description highlights two important dimensions eco-innovation study paper : complexity appropri-ability . one hand , eco-innovations complex systemic character , results involvement different actors production . suggests need knowledge base eco- innovations produced diverse . Relatedly , recent years , research economics interested studying complexity countries ’ economic activities effect different dimensions economic growth , emissions income inequality ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) . paper , argue economic complexity theory also important understanding eco-innovation , theory maintains countries heterogeneous terms diversity products produce diversity , turn , related knowledge , skills capabilities country . Therefore , study , link economic complexity countries production eco-patents country level . hand , appropriability risks eco-innovation explained existence double externality : ( 1 ) companies produce generate knowledge spill agents , competitors suppliers , time , ( 2 ) eco- innovations reduce environmental impact economic activities , benefiting society general . double externality may translate appropriability problem , producers eco-innovations perceive difficulties capturing value resulting genera-tion ( Beise Rennings , 2005 ) . appropriability problem eco-innovations treated market failure , requires external intervention form incentives eco-innovative agents ( Borghesi et al. , 2015 ) . study , based institutional theory , focuses two external factors ( intellectual property rights effectiveness judicial system ) verify whether contribute reduce appropriability problem thus support production eco-patents . Therefore , paper use economic complexity theory institutional theory explain production eco-innovations country level . develop three hypotheses subsequently tested data country level gathered multiple public sources . collected data Worldwide Patent Statistical database ( PAT-STAT ) , International Institute Management Development ( In-ternational Institute Management Development , 2021 ) World Competitiveness Report , World Bank , Atlas Economic Complexity , United Nations Educational , Scientific Cultural Organization ( UNESCO , 2022 ) database , Global Competitiveness Report Organization Economic Co-operation Develop-ment ( OECD,2023 ) Science & Technology data . study takes Furman et al . ( 2001 ) starting point focuses production green patents 24 countries belonging OECD period 2007–2016 . results , using negative binomial regression , reveal economic complexity intellectual property rights positive effect production eco-patents advanced countries . paper makes several important contributions study eco- innovation , particularly respect influences external factors production eco-patents developed countries . First , study offers novel theoretical perspective three external factors - economic complexity , intellectual property rights , effectiveness judicial system - act enablers production eco-patents . unique theoretical argument broadens understanding external influences eco-innovation , especially production eco-patents . Second , research provides empirical evidence importance economic complexity understanding value creation eco-innovation advanced countries . empirically validating link country ’ economic complexity ability generate eco-patents , study contributes new dimension eco- innovation literature . Similarly , revealing positive effect in-tellectual property rights eco-innovation , emphasizes impor-tance protecting value created eco-innovation . Finally , paper implications policymakers managers . Regarding former , two means suggested , economic complexity intellectual property rights , policymakers incentivize eco- innovation . Regarding latter , results suggest countries differ terms ability generate eco-innovations capture value created , aspects must therefore considered managers focusing production type innovation . paper structured follows . second section reviews literature external country determinants eco-innovation . third section develops theoretical framework allows us pro-pose hypotheses . fourth section presents sample variables used . fifth section presents results obtained finally , sixth section shows discussion draws main conclusions implications . 2 . External country drivers eco-innovation Concern environment increasingly common among com-panies ( Díaz-García et al. , 2015 ) consumers ’ awareness environmental impact actions growing ( De Marchi , 2012 ) . led consolidation eco-innovation essential element economic development , allows decoupling envi-ronmental pressures economic growth ( Zubeltzu-Jaka et al. , 2018 ) . Generally speaking , type innovation simultaneously im-proves economic environmental performance ( Costantini Mazzanti , 2012 ) production increasing . PATSTAT data show green patent activity growing steadily , even reaching annual growth rates 17 % Netherlands 2014 16 % 2012 Sweden . Research drivers eco-innovation useful policy makers managers promote adoption ( Ghisetti Pontoni , 2015 ) . Given particularities eco-innovation mentioned Introduction , reasonable assume factors driving pro-duction different types innovation ( De Marchi , 2012 ) , least , act different intensity . therefore sur-prising much research topic devoted identifying determinants . result , study “ eco-innovation drivers ” recurring theme literature ( Cainelli et al. , 2015 ; Ghisetti et al. , 2015 ; Parrilli et al. , 2023 ) . innovations seen processes innovative firms involved , also encompass external actors , including institutions , infrastructures , consumer practices ( Cillo et al. , 2019 ) . Therefore , S. Donis et al . Technovation 128 ( 2023 ) 1028683is possible distinguish drivers internal firms , external . paper , focus drivers eco-innovation external firm . Specifically , focus analysis certain characteristics countries may influence production eco- innovations . conditions literature review conduct section . following paragraphs , consider research done three distinct types drivers : environmental regu-lation , policy instruments countries ’ financial system . Starting environmental regulation , defined regulation may “ force ” firms realize environmental innovation ( Horbach , 2008 ) considered one main drivers eco-innovation ( Hille et al. , 2020 ; Zhang et al. , 2021 ) . instance , Law 138/2013 renewable sources energy came force 2013 Albania promote innovation new technologies electricity heat pro-duction using renewable energy sources ( Grantham Research Institute Climate Change Environment , 2023b ) . literature sug-gests one reasons environmental regulation reduce problem appropriability ( De Marchi , 2012 ) . appropriability problem mainly caused specific characteristic eco-innovations , “ double externality ” ( Rennings , 2000 ) . double externality means production eco-innovations give rise knowledge spillovers . one hand , external agents benefit in-vestments made producer eco-innovation , without latter receiving compensation . hand , type innovation creates benefit society , company producing internalize ( Krammer , 2015 ) . Therefore , incentives invest type innovation diminished difficulty capturing value generated ( Ghisetti et al. , 2017 ; Nanda Kerr , 2015 ) . Peng et al . ( 2021 ) , Orsatti et al . ( 2020 ) , Colombelli et al . ( 2021 ) Cecere et al . ( 2020 ) confirm stricter environmental regulations positively influence eco-innovation . literature also investigated different types regulation ( command-and-control , market-based volun-tary ) influence technologies . results show market-based regulation greatest impact long range , expected results achieved appropriate combination ( Zhang et al. , 2021 ) . Policy instruments defined set governmental techniques involve use limitation state resources purpose achieving policy objectives ( Howlett Rayner , 2007 ) . terms innovation policies , Greco et al . ( 2022 ) show combined effect environmental generic innovation policies process eco-innovations stronger individual effect generic inno-vation policies , short long term . literature determinants eco-innovation distinguishes two cate-gories policy instruments : technology-push demand-pull types . Technology-push instruments increase scientific technolog-ical knowledge , demand-pull ones expand size market ( Del Río et al. , 2015 ; Horbach et al. , 2012 ; Hille et al. , 2020 ) . Despite differences , instruments considered drivers eco-innovation ( Costantini et al. , 2017 ) . studies argue market-based ( MBIs ) demand-pull instruments , taxes emission permits , preferable technology-push ones context eco-innovation . pollution reduced , greater number benefits MBIs provide , whereas , target reached , technology-push instruments incentivize pollution reduction , advantages increase ( Fabrizi et al. , 2018 ) . Li ( 2022 ) states higher tax emissions always leads higher investment green innovation . However , Frondel et al . ( 2008 ) show MBIs less effective technology-push instruments promoting eco-innovation . Relatedly , Costantini et al . ( 2017 ) demonstrate impact different policy instruments depend type policy instrument used , degree technological maturity innovation . Jové-Llopis Segarra-Blasco ( 2020 ) also show influence market-pull factors differs within subgroups services . additional possibility application instruments could comple-mentary ( Cantner et al. , 2016 ) , although must combined balanced way ( Costantini Crespi , 2013 ; Costantini et al. , 2015 , 2017 ) . fact , generated debate countries . instance , Germany started strong emphasis demand pull measures , however high associated costs gave rise contro-versial debate whether balance push pull instruments Germany ’ policy mix would allowed achieve objectives cost-effectively ( Nuñez-Jimenez et al. , 2022 ) . literature external drivers eco-innovation also paid attention role national financial system . national financial system represents institutions markets responsible carrying financial transactions exchange money lenders borrowers ( Babu , 2018 ) . example , climate risk stress test conducted Bank England ’ UK financial system support development sustainable initiatives ( Carney , 2019 ) . Therefore , national financial system relevant factor promoting eco-innovation , mobilize large amounts funds allocate innovative environmental projects ( Olmos et al. , 2012 ) address financial obstacles ( Cecere et al. , 2014 ) . financial component relevant environmental innovation re-flected several analyses : foreign direct investment inflows remittances developing countries ( Li et al. , 2018 ; Farooq , 2023 ; Khan et al. , 2020 ) , access public funds tax incentives ( Cecere et al. , 2020 ; Sánchez-Sellero Bataineh , 2022 ) , green subsidies ( Hu et al. , 2021 ) governments ’ direct financial expenditure envi-ronmental protection ( Long Liao , 2022 ) . brief literature review highlights interest understanding role different external factors , focusing country characteristics , production eco-innovations . study aims contribute literature analysing role complexity institutional theories production eco-innovations . show , addition two theories relevant understanding value cre-ation value appropriation eco-innovations thus incen-tivizing production eco-innovations . First , consider role diversity country ’ knowledge base , captured economic complexity . Second , explore role institutional theory , focusing role intellectual property effectiveness legal system appropriating value created eco-innovations . 3 . Theoretical framework hypotheses Value creation value appropriation two different dimensions , influence company ’ ability achieve sustainable competitive advantage . Value creation innovation activities value created innovation determines potential competitive advantage . Value appropriation refers firm ’ ability capture value created innovation affects compet-itive advantage achieved firm ( Teece , 1986 ) . Therefore , addition seeking novel ways create value , innovative firms also strive appropriate value innovation activities . Since innovating involves high costs , firms incentives incur see possibility capturing least part rents innovation , recoup investment earn return excess opportunity costs ( Arrow , 1962 ) . mentioned Introduction , eco-innovations two char-acteristics significant influence firms ’ incentives invest production : greater complexity appropriability problem . first characteristic mainly influences production eco-innovations , therefore , creation value . second , however , related capture value derived eco- innovation . argue two attributes make eco-innovations sensitive certain characteristics environment firms operate . Specifically , hypotheses relate first attributes economic complexity countries . Similarly , argue second characteristic eco-innovation makes eco-innovations S. Donis et al . Technovation 128 ( 2023 ) 1028684more sensitive two features formal institutional environment , namely , intellectual property rights effectiveness judicial system . Hence , integrate economic complexity theory ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) institutional theory ( North , 1990 ) explain value creation value appropriation countries ’ eco-innovations . Economic complexity theory builds Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) ’ measurement dimension , captures country ca-pabilities predicts future growth . Hidalgo ( 2021 ) reviews appli-cations analyses relationship variations countries ’ income , economic growth , emissions economic inequality . relationship also extended literature innovation . economies greater economic complexity would greater potential find combinations factors could become valuable innovations . argue , fact eco-innovations require greater variety inputs makes economic complexity even relevant factor production . analysis contributes emerging literature relating countries ’ economic complexity CO2 emissions environmental performance ( Boleti et al. , 2021 ; Li et al. , 2023 ; Mealy Teytelboym , 2022 ; Romero Gramkow , 2021 ) presents mechanism relationships explained . paper , also argue characteristics institu-tional environment firms carry activities influence production eco-innovations impact ability firms appropriate value created . Teece ( 1986 ) argues inno-vative firms tend obtain significant economic returns explains based three factors : appropriability regime , possession complementary assets dominant design paradigm . Thus , appropriability regime one main factors determining com-pany ’ propensity innovate ( Dosi et al. , 2006 ) . encompasses set environmental factors reflect innovator ’ ability capture benefits generated . dimensions included appropriability regime nature technology effectiveness legal protection mechanisms ( Teece , 1986 ) . focus latter dimension institutional theory , gained special relevance eco-innovation literature ( see , example , Zhang et al. , 2020 ; Guo et al. , 2022 Xie et al. , 2023 ) . Institutional theory explains innovative behaviour external pressures social expectations ( Cai Li , 2018 ) , make environmental innovation attractive ( Berrone et al. , 2013 ) encourage firms initiate eco-innovations ( Dong et al. , 2022 ) . North ( 1990 ) distinguishes formal in-stitutions ( laws , regulations rules ) informal institutions ( norms , culture ethics ) . terms eco-innovations , types in-stitutions influence eco-innovation ( Lubacha Wendler , 2021 ; Orlando et al. , 2020 ) , seem sensitive legal pro-tection mechanisms . focus attention two formal in-stitutions believe may direct relationship appropriability value derived eco-innovation , intel-lectual property rights effectiveness judicial system . 3.1 . Economic complexity study drivers eco-innovation , useful focus characteristics eco-innovations . Among , greater complexity eco-innovations , opposed generic innovations , stands ( see , example , Chaparro-Banegas et al. , 2023 ; Kemp Pontoglio , 2011 ) . Different studies analysed complexity eco-innovations , using firm unit analysis ( see , example , De Marchi , 2012 , Ghisetti et al. , 2015 ) . Complexity captures variety knowledge , components competencies required develop new technology ( Lerner , 1994 ) . Barbieri et al . ( 2020 ) argue complexity type innovation reflected variety knowledge sources technological components used , requiring complex knowledge recombination . example , need diverse knowledge leads family firms participate inter-firm R & networks technological relatedness high ( Ardito et al. , 2019b ) . words , firms wishing eco-innovate seek knowledge terms breadth depth ( Ghisetti et al. , 2015 ) . complexity eco-innovations leads firms combine different activities ( Abadzhiev et al. , 2022 ) : systemic innovation proactive innovators , process innovation reactive innovators inaction technology-independent actors . therefore clear external knowledge promotes sustainability ( Kobarg et al. , 2020 ) driver eco-innovation ( see , example , Ghisetti et al. , 2015 ; Ben Amara Chen , 2020 ; Chistov et al. , 2021 ) . significant differences countries terms technological domains possess necessary competences invest complex technologies ( Pugliese et al. , 2017 ) . Countries need keep diverse range knowledge available enable produce diversity technologically sophisticated innovative products ( Hausmann et al. , 2014 ) . Knowledge basis inventive activity ( Fleming Sorenson , 2001 ; Horbach et al. , 2012 ) precisely , technology breadth positive effect techno-logical development green energy sector ( Ardito et al. , 2019a ) recombination diverse knowledge enables creation green energy techniques greater impact ( Ardito et al. , 2016 ) . Thus , countries diverse knowledge base likely produce eco-innovations thus contribute value creation . Economic complexity theory establishes way capture knowledge diversity country level represented economic complexity index countries , received increasing attention recent years ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) . defined diversity ca-pabilities country interactions . Economic complexity serve measure society ’ knowledge ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ) . dimension directly related production innovations , countries higher economic complexity export technologically sophisticated products ( Balland et al. , 2022 ) . line , Mealy Teytelboym ( 2022 ) suggest countries larger capacity export complex green products higher rates green patents , produce lower CO2 emissions stricter environ-mental policies . Romero Gramkow ( 2021 ) conclude complex economies tend produce goods efficiently , reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity per capita emissions . Boleti et al . ( 2021 ) point economic complexity leads greater product sophisti-cation , improving environmental performance Li et al . ( 2023 ) showed moderating effect eco-innovation economic complexity index leads decrease carbon emissions . According OECD data Atlas Economic Complexity , Chile Colombia average pollution levels among OECD countries low rates economic complexity . argue countries higher economic complexity maintain greater diversity expertise , leading produce hetero-geneous sophisticated variety goods , thus complex products , countries lower degrees economic complexity ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) . discussed , eco-innovations complex novel type innovation non-eco-innovations , thus requiring greater diversity expertise ( Ghisetti et al. , 2015 ; Ketata et al. , 2015 ) . Therefore , seek contribute literature expect eco-innovation critically depend economic complexity activities surrounding firm , becoming instru-ment value creation . Accordingly , propose following first hypothesis . Hypothesis 1 . National economic complexity positively influences production green patents . 3.2 . Intellectual property rights Protection mechanisms usually included definition property rights patents , copyrights , trademarks trade secrets , well utility industrial models ( Burrone , 2005 ) . instruments grant inventors monopoly rights commercial activity S. Donis et al . Technovation 128 ( 2023 ) 1028685innovations ( Krammer , 2015 ) . protection mechanisms considered barriers imitation new products processes , consequently , support mechanisms invest innovation ( Rumelt , 1984 ) . literature usually organizes mechanisms two groups , two types appropriation strategies configured ( Colombelli et al. , 2021 ) : formal ones , include intel-lectual property rights , patents trademarks , informal ones , trade secrets use complementary assets . paper , use institutional theory focusing intellectual property rights effects production eco-patents , discussion centred , fundamentally , mechanism . Patents type formal intellectual protection mechanism traditionally considered effective instrument appropriation ( Fried-man et al. , 1991 ) . According Evers ( 1994 ) , patent legal docu-ment grants holder exclusive right exploit invention country patent applied . Patents determine degree appropriability inventor , i.e. , delimit creator ’ ability capture benefits derived innovation ( Barbosa Faria , 2011 ) . Many countries opted strict patent protection laws , stimulate growth development companies , enhance reputation , impose barriers imitation , incentivize research , create technology disseminate information safely , guar-anteeing inventor ’ monopoly limited time ( Barbosa Faria , 2011 ; Colombelli et al. , 2021 ; Edquist , 1997 ; Furukawa , 2007 ) . Intellectual property laws establish patented , well patents granted scope , addition rights inventors duration rights ( Henry Stiglitz , 2010 ) . literature considers intellectual property rights incentive innovation ( Chesbrough Crowther , 2006 ; Dosi et al. , 2006 ) , specially , countries high capacity produce large volumes patents ( Sharma et al. , 2022 ) . Indeed , much literature considers quality intellectual property regime obvious form institutional protection indispensable condition capturing benefits innovation ( Dosi et al. , 2006 ; Hurmaleinna -- Laukkanen Puumalainen , 2007 ) . Furthermore , Hall et al . ( 2010 ) show weak intellectual property rights lead non-appropriation innovation returns , causing losses innovative activities . Similarly , Athreye et al . ( 2020 ) argue difficulty capturing benefits innovations results lower research development ( R & ) investment . Therefore , extent strength intellectual property rights differs countries , incentives firms produce green patents also different . Empirical evidence ownership mechanisms sustainable inno-vation scarce ( Vimalnath et al. , 2022 ) need know impact IPRs development diffusion sustainable innovations ( Eppinger et al. , 2021 ) . Ensuring appropriability results regulation intellectual property rights companies produce may critical types inno-vation due double externality discussed . Expansionary monetary policies , supported strong property rights protection , favour green innovation activities developing countries ( Yin et al. , 2022 ) . study Chinese provinces , found better intellectual property protection could effectively fight cor-ruption , allowing development green technology greater extent ( Nie et al. , 2023 ) . sample South Korean companies , Roh et al . ( 2021 ) considered intellectual property rights knowledge-based competence showed positive effect green innovation . Across sample 52 green innovations developed OECD countries , observed semi-open intellectual property strategies ( non-exclusive licensing collaboration particular ) pro-tection innovations chosen 50 % sample ( Vimalnath et al. , 2020 ) . sample sustainable manufacturing industries , in-tellectual property rights support organizations sustainable ac-tivity structural way ( Eppinger et al. , 2021 ) . Considering effectiveness patent protection determined way patent rights defined , complete definition make patent protection effective provide clearer incentive eco-innovation . Conversely , intellectual property rights vaguely defined , make ownership difficult reduce incentive companies eco-innovate . words , given arguments nature eco-innovations ( including diversity knowledge , often requires collaboration , double externality uncertainty ) , strength intellectual property rights protection element determine quantity green patents produced country , reduces uncertainty regarding firm ’ ability appropriate rents . strength intellectual property rights high , firms clearly perceive possibility appropriating value eco-innovations , i.e. , problem appropriability reduced , therefore , expect environments production green patents increase . Consequently , second hypothesis propose . Hypothesis 2 . strength intellectual property rights country positively influences production green patents . 3.3 . Effectiveness judicial system Continuing institutional theory , also argue appropriation value eco-innovation depends fundamentally intellectual property rights enforced . specifically , propose production green patents depends effective-ness judicial system . quality judicial system positively related R & investment economic growth ( Seitz Watzinger , 2016 ) . Comin Hobijn ( 2009 ) point judicial system effective , new technologies replace old ones slowly . Yang ( 2017 ) argues fair judicial system positively associated innovative firms . Consequently , protection mechanisms legal instruments promote innovation , necessary reliable effective judicial system , one composed clear , strict , rigorous rules , ensure innovators appropriate results obtained . country ’ institutional policy implement optimal legal protection mechanisms promote innovation , judicial system effective reliable , provide sufficient security certainty innovation projects . case , innovators may decide move production countries effectiveness judicial system higher ( Rosenbuch et al. , 2019 ) . Improvements institutional quality would reduce CO2 emissions , improving environmental quality ( Khan et al. , 2021 ) . sample developing countries , 1 % increase institutional quality reduces carbon dioxide emissions 0.313 % ( Ali et al. , 2019 ) . Moreover , legitimacy generates comfort around efforts diffuse green innovations ( Gharib et al. , 2022 ) conversely , environmental innovation also improves legitimacy positions ( Berrone et al. , 2013 ) . effective judi-cial system requires integration different methods conflict resolution guarantee citizens access swift , legitimate effec-tive justice ( López-Barajas , 2012 ) . resolution judicial conflicts , companies rely correct execution contracts , protection property rights performance police courts ( Bar-bosa Faria , 2011 ) . effective judicial system provides security guarantee police , judicial correctional procedures , i.e. , ensures correct performance legal protection mechanisms , conse-quently , ensures appropriation benefits eco-innovation . effectiveness judicial system related less institutional cor-ruption ( Leitao , 2016 ) , promote green technological inno-vation due decreased uncertainty ( Nie et al. , 2023 ; Xie et al. , 2023 ) . Tebaldi Elmslie ( 2013 ) show degree efficiency judicial system explains part variation patenting across coun-tries . judicial system strengthens weakens ability investors appropriate value created innovation activities . vein , Teece ( 1986 ) argues nature technology effectiveness legal protection mechanism key dimensions S. Donis et al . Technovation 128 ( 2023 ) 1028686of appropriability regime . Based arguments , eco-innovations present series characteristics ( systematic complex nature well risky uncertain benefits , addition frequently produced wide collaborative networks ) suggest need effective judicial system . means eco-innovators perceive likely capture value in-vestments cases judicial system effective allowing appropriate returns investment . Consequently , propose following third hypothesis . Hypothesis 3 . effectiveness judicial system positively in-fluences production green patents . 4 . Empirical analysis 4.1 . Sample data literature identified three ways measure eco-innovation : questionnaire-based surveys , R & expenditures patent informa-tion ( Kemp Pearson , 2007 ) . Patents become common mea-sure innovation ( Acs et al. , 2002 ) , provide disaggregated information invention inventor ( Perruchas et al. , 2020 ) , public documents ( Archibugi Pianta , 1996 ) often filed research process , acting good indicator development research activities ( Griliches , 1990 ) . Moreover , unlike R & ex-penditures , patent data available many countries long period time ( Costantini Mazzanti , 2012 ) , making excellent quantitative analyses possible ( Costantini et al. , 2017 ) making application quite simple ( Archibugi Pianta , 1996 ) . However , using patents measure innovation also several drawbacks . First , innovations patented , patentable , inventor decides protect inventions methods , trade secrets utility models ( Costantini Maz-zanti , 2012 ) . drawbacks wide variation quality patents depending product linked ( Griliches , 1990 ) different propensity firms patent ( Archibugi Pianta , 1996 ) . Despite limitations , patents still considered suitable resource analysing process technological change , mainly ease access data availability long periods time ( Griliches , 1990 ) . Consequently , following idea patents observable manifestation inventive activity strong universal basis ( Furman et al. , 2001 ) , taken green patents unit measurement green innovation ( see , example , Ardito et al. , 2016 ; Ardito et al. , 2019a ; Ardito et al. , 2019b Berrone et al. , 2013 ) . starting empirical model explaining patent production country level model Furman et al . ( 2001 ) . case , augment model proposed authors variables measuring three hypotheses raised . data used analysis come mainly PATSTAT database , contains information patents worldwide published European Patent Office ( EPO ) ( European Patent Office , 2017 ) . sources used measurement independent control variables IMD World Competitiveness Report , data World Bank , Atlas Economic Complexity , UNESCO data-base , Global Competitiveness Report ( Global Competitiveness Report , 2022 ) OECD Science & Technology data . analysis focuses sample OECD countries period 2007–2016 . addition , eliminated countries observations less four years .1 focus OECD region interesting pioneer promoting green growth made growth strategy essential part policy framework ( OECD , 2020 ) . Ahmad Wu ( 2022 ) consider OECD region representative laboratory rest industrialized world study sustainable development . Besides , OECD region seen increase carbon footprint since 2000 , particularly due transportation energy use ( Indicators , 2019 ) region implemented many policies improve environmental quality past two decades . Environmental knowledge awareness among policymakers society lower emerging economies well ( Horbach , 2016 ) , related first hypothesis . turn , research eco-innovations developed economies scarce ( Horbach , 2016 ; Stojčić , 2021 ) , sample mainly advanced economies . 4.2 . Description variables 4.2.1 . Dependent variables According Trajtenberg ( 1990 ) , patents observable manifestation inventive activity universal character , instrument may reasonably reveal eco-innovative capacity country , making possible study dependence economic complexity , intellectual property rights effectiveness judicial system . mentioned , measure eco-innovation use number green patents produced country . Green patents set technologies potential reduce environmental problems ( Cohen et al. , 2021 ) . Green technologies , consequently green patents , lower environmental impact non-green alternatives ( OECD , 2011 ) . Data green patents extracted PATSTAT , published EPO . determine patents related environment , Cooperative Patent Classification used . Specifically , green patents represented Y02 group “ Technologies applications mitigation adaptation climate change ” ( De Cunzo , et al. , 2022 ) , presents eight types green patents : Y02A “ Climate change adaptation technologies ” , Y02B “ Climate change mitigation technologies related buildings ” , Y02C “ Capture , storage , sequestration removal greenhouse gases ” , Y02D “ Climate change mitigation technologies information communication technolo-gies ” , Y02E “ Reduction greenhouse gas emissions related generation ” , Y02P “ Climate change mitigation technologies pro-duction transformation goods ” , Y02T “ Climate change mitigation technologies related transport ” Y02W “ Climate change mitigation technologies related wastewater treatment waste management ” . 4.2.2 . Independent variables information measure independent variables collected three sources ( see Table 1 details ) : Atlas Economic Complexity , IMD World Competitiveness Report World Bank ( World Bank , 2023 ) . Economic complexity . information used measure Economic complexity comes Atlas Economic Complexity . variable use index based idea countries wide range knowledge produce wide range goods . index calculated diversity exports produced country ubiquity ( number countries capable producing ) ( Atlas Economic Complexity , 2021 ) . variable calculated country continuous variable takes values 0 country pro-duces diversity goods lower average countries 0 diversity activities performed higher average .

Nevertheless , study shows importance appropriability rights incentivizing production green patents related recent discussion role appropriability rights . 6.2 . Managerial implications Since main agent eco-innovations firm ( Rennings , 2000 ) , managerial implications paper important . Managers need pay attention specificities country want produce green patents . Based results obtained , economic complexity intellectual property rights play important role production eco-innovations , managers assess two dimensions countries intend develop eco-innovations . results suggests firms able produce eco-innovations easily countries high levels economic complexity Germany South Korea , rather countries lower levels Colombia Greece . Focusing appropriability value created eco- innovations , results suggest bounded institu-tional environment eco-innovation produced . Faced weak uncertain institutional environment , firms may encouraged invest eco-innovations , may perceive uncertainty appropriate value produced . Since firm ’ sustainable competitive advantage depends difficult competitors imitate , institutional mechanisms must strong efficient . According results , eco-innovative firms countries Finland Denmark , among countries stronger intellectual property rights , lower appropriability problem firms Mexico Poland , weaker intellectual property rights . 6.3 . Policy implications Along academic managerial implications , study also policy implications . Economic complexity enables devel-opment sophisticated complex products ( Balland et al. , 2022 ) , discussed study , eco-innovations higher levels complexity novelty types innovations . results reveal , economic complexity enhances production . Complex economies likely produce efficiently reduce pollution ( Romero Gramkow , 2021 Boleti et al. , 2021 ) , study suggests green patenting production complex economies also increases . core policy implication policymakers promote policies improve levels economic complexity , industrial innovation strategies ( Pugliese Tacchella , 2020 ) helping economies take advantage capacities diversify complex ways ( Balland et al. , 2022 ) . Given problem appropriability characterises eco- innovations , seems necessary ensure benefits eco- innovations captured . Policy makers pay attention issue . Vimalnath et al .
