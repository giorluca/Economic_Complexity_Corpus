Arthur Keynes Soros current economic crisis , precipitated corona virus pandemic , demonstrates inherent fragility contemporary capitalist economic system drastic consequences costs human suffering result neglecting needed reform . period seeming high employment feverish speculative activity financial markets depression conditions widespread market crashes , current economic system marked severe abrupt swings reversals expectations beliefs so-called economic fundamentals . Yet little theory economics explaining expectation belief reversals despite fact concept expectations central thinking economy since J. M. Keynes . paper , , seeks contribute theory expectations belief reversals analyzing evolutionary complexity economics framework . formulates analysis specifically terms concept reflexivity , drawing pioneering ideas regarding reflexivity George Soros regarding reflexivity financial markets . Consider first , , connection evolutionary-complexity approach economy reflexivity concept . Brian Arthur characterizes complexity economics framework economic thought fundamentally different standard neoclassical equilibrium theory following way : different way seeing economy . gives different view , one actions strategies constantly evolve , time becomes important , structures constantly form re-form , phenomena appear visible standard equilibrium analysis , meso-layer micro macro becomes important ( Arthur , 2013 , p. 1 ) . Arthur , , emphasizes reflexivity connection . complex economic systems , economic agents ’ actions strategies constantly evolve agents interact networks heterogeneous agents constantly revise adapt actions strategies response others revise adapt actions strategies . , economic agents adaptive economic agents . emphasizing reflexivity may explain , , people revise 3 adapt actions strategies interaction one another continually changing circumstances . understanding clearly requires make time central explanation economy . Reflexivity accordingly explains time dimension terms idea temporal feedback loop , whereby people ’ expectations future interaction others feed back influence current actions strategies , current actions strategies feed forward influence future interaction others . effect , reflexivity makes expectations interdependent across people time . summarize saying reflexivity theory theory agency adaptive agents embedded evolving structures networks social economic interaction . Following Arthur ’ comparison complexity theory standard equilibrium theory , , reflexivity theory accordingly provides us relational account socially economically embedded adaptive agents compared neoclassicism ’ fixed preference account atomistic agents . thus characterize adaptive agents ‘ reflexive economic agents ’ describe interaction paper terms reflexive economic processes . paper begins lay role reflexivity theory understood way plays explaining reflexive economic agents interact complex economic processes . one start ? One important subjects application reflexivity thinking economics interdependent expectations financial markets . begin subject – actually one paradigmatic aspect , boom-bust cycles financial markets – allows us first focus whole sets heterogeneous expectations explain reflexive behavior systemic way terms evolution specific structure interaction . complexity-reflexivity approach nonetheless seeks explain structures interaction economic agents co-evolve . procedure , , begin level structure interaction bring reflexive process involves , turn influences agents ’ evolution , turning back influences evolution structure interact . Keynes initiated approach terms interdependent expectations framed beauty contest idea reflexivity terms single set interdependent expectations resulting investors focusing others believe others believe good investments 4 ( Keynes , 1936 ) .1 recently , Soros , explicitly characterizes analysis boom-bust cycles bubbles financial markets application reflexivity theory , links speculative expectations expectations economic fundamentals , uses develop view expectations operate financial markets ( Soros , 1987 , 2013 ) . seems , , explain reflexivity financial markets terms interdependent expectations , whatever particular application choose adopt , first need determine describe different ‘ sets ’ expectations . , begin Soros ’ boom-bust analysis , since combining speculative expectations expectations fundamentals , provides comprehensive view set interdependent expectations might involve . Boom-bust cycles bubbles , course , one financial markets phenomenon . complexity-reflexivity theory paradigmatic one , concern specific , relatively well-defined structure evolves together evolution agents ’ expectations . Soros , , every boom-bust process two components : underlying trend fundamentals misconception value financial asset stock based upon fundamentals . boom , trend underlying value reinforced misconception future value stock driving price . rising stock price improves fundamentals stock ’ value based , example , form greater capacity finance operations acquire firms , driving earnings per share thus giving impetus stock ’ price rise ( see Soros , 2014 , p. 324 Figure 4 ) . reflexivity terms , speculators ’ expectations future , case involving misconception future value asset , feed back influences present raising current market price earnings per share , feeds forward speculators ’ expectation future , etc. , continuing reflexive feedback loop . Yet speculative behavior , Soros argues , drives stock price faster firms able improve earnings , point , price seen high relative fundamentals , bust occurs . associates boom positive feedback process expectations stock ’ price – increases lead speculators expect even higher prices stock . bust , negative feedback process prevails , stock price increases decreasing 1 Keynes thought complexity terms researchers recognize ( cf . Marchionatti , 2010 ; Davis , 2017 ) , perhaps employed earlier vocabulary associations . 5 rate , reflecting underlying trends earnings gradual improvement stock ’ fundamentals . latter circumstances involve calls ‘ near-equilibrium conditions ’ compared bubble-like ‘ far-from equilibrium conditions ’ exist boom . effect , circumstances positive feedback cycle depart collapse back circumstances negative feedback , speculative episode bubble replaced everyday course events businesses operate reasonably predictably . Soros ’ focus , , like Keynes ’ , financial markets stock prices , contrast Keynes ’ beauty contest idea , Soros ’ reflexivity theory makes boom-bust cycle depend interrelated movements stock prices underlying fundamentals . Since one denies , including Keynes ( cf . Marcuzzo , 2020 ) , fundamentals play sort role determining stock prices , financial market conception set expectations perhaps better seen limiting case.2 time , since determinants movements stock prices underlying fundamentals relatively independent , Soros ’ analysis suggests think terms one single set expectations governing stock prices , terms two different heterogeneous types expectation processes , one associated financial side economy , one associated economic fundamentals , whose interaction explains boom-bust cycles , bubbles , similar financial phenomena . perspective makes reflexivity theory theory interacting , interdependent expectations , involving complex interaction multiple , heterogeneous sets expectations different interacting , reflexive economic agents . adopt conception expectations paper develop basic way terms two sets expectations involved Soros ’ analysis boom-bust cycles . immediate task paper , , make two arguments explain boom-bust cycles work : 2 course considerable debate fundamentals , view many critics mainstream share nature misrepresented neoclassical individualist welfare framework . Thus , treat idea fundamentals broadly main determinants economic activity production consumption , assume evolve together economic activity . 6 - first , one two sets expectations regarding stock prices fundamentals interact turning point cycle ; - second , one two sets expectations interact upswing boom leading turning point . first argument goal showing turning point boom-bust cycle involves phase transition kind qualitative change – important object explanation complexity economics – due change relationship two sets expectations manifests wave call ‘ belief reversals. ’ Soros ’ explain bust occurs economic fundamentals re-assert following boom . says point agents ’ views stock prices become far removed underlying trends determining stock prices bust ensues . also implies problem stock prices ‘ balance ’ underlying trends fundamentals boom . first part argument , , explains idea terms two types expectations , gotten increasingly ‘ balance , ’ get rebalanced turning point cycle . importance explaining turning points boom-bust cycles terms different sets expectations get rebalanced complexity theory , , identifies one mechanism interdependence agents produces changes structure economy , least aspect . goal second argument examine two types expectations get ‘ balance ’ boom . follow Soros explaining booms terms misconceptions nature positive feedback processes operating stock prices economic fundamentals argue problem especially concerns positive feedback processes associated economic fundamentals due inherent ambiguity involved economic agents understanding underlying cause-and-effect determinants . general problem understanding underlying causal determinants observable processes case negative feedback much less serious , prevail boom ‘ near-equilibrium conditions ’ economic relationships relatively stable . thus argue biases economic agents ‘ far-from equilibrium conditions ’ toward seeing positive feedback 7 processes also stable predictable model negative ones , though often , explains misconceptions boom stock prices . particularly different way approach reflexivity paper connection financial markets treat expectation judgment , rather reflexive judgment . two main reasons take approach . First , focusing judgments people make world makes possible talk beliefs , people ’ judgments reflect beliefs . People ’ beliefs economy also continually change interact one another , significant change beliefs often associated significant change economy . Thus , focusing judgment takes us beyond simply mapping changing sets expectations , gives us way understanding motivates change people ’ expectations . Second , especially important act judgment point-in-time nature . judgment singular event episode historical time agents consult beliefs take position interaction others ways may influence interaction plays . Thus focus judgment singular occasion agents act beliefs possibly change – ‘ Minsky moment ’ ( 1982 ) – makes possible investigate turning points unique occasions involving significant shift beliefs , speculative positions adopt evidence may fall short justifying positions . Focusing judgment admittedly gives approach somewhat different way explaining complex adaptive economic systems compared way mathematically explained much complexity economics terms nonlinear dynamics agent interaction networks . methods , important explanatory goal explain phase transitions qualitative changes structure economy . Phase transitions described quite well mathematical terms , still leaves unexplained specific state expectations produces transition new state affairs economy . Thus , “ uncomfortable thing ” many models explanations “ necessary proximate major cause sudden shift aggregate state ” would explain economy self-organizes new basis ( Kirman , 2010 , p. 502 ) . Thus , one goal judgment-based approach reflexivity employed explain terms configurations beliefs , discuss evaluate light specific historical circumstances . 8 Section two lays basic foundation rest paper defining explaining nature reflexive process feedback loops , emphasizing unique role reflexivity plays social science . Section three , concerning first argument , describes turning point boom-bust cycle phase transition brought change relationship two sets expectations . associate change wave belief reversals describe precipitated self-fulfilling self-defeating prophecies understood special type reflexive prediction . section four , concerning second argument , argue misconception Soros believes operates upswing boom-bust cycle due inherent ambiguity associated nature positive feedback processes drive boom . place positive feedback processes spectrum relatively predictable highly unpredictable , argue economic agents fail recognize situations latter end spectrum biased toward understanding cause-and-effect processes terms relatively predictable negative feedback processes . section five draw general conclusions reflexivity contributes thinking complex economic processes implies nature reflexive economic agents . 2 . Reflexivity general terms basic idea behind concept reflexivity , word suggests , something ‘ turned back upon itself. ’ social science concept refers views expectations people future ‘ turn back ’ present influence present . philosophy science terms , reflexivity thus complicates basic one-directional understanding cause-and-effect happens present simply causes happens future . basic understanding fits natural world physical science fairly well , natural agents little capacity imagine future , views future feed back onto influence behavior present . social world , however , people imagine future , furthermore use understanding cause-and-effect change present order influence happens future . Human beings differ natural agents intentional beings rudimentary understanding nature causality . anticipate future , form plans future , reflexively act promote plans present . 9 Thus , present affect future human world , future , rather views people , ‘ turns back ’ affects present . fill picture bit terms idea feedback loop , add since people present anticipation future causal effects future plays , future changed enters people subsequently view future . , people act present view changing future , constantly changes world works also ultimately views future well . effect , human intentionality understanding world works imply present future continually reconstituted human action . social world thus never always emergent evolving Arthur emphasizes , non-ergodic process Paul Davidson describes ( Davidson , 2009 ) . thus characterize reflexive process social world on-going , constantly evolving two-directional cause-and-effect process present future views future influence present , influence future , influence views future , . set schematically feedback loop Figure 1 . Figure 1 : reflexive adjustment process expectations future - > influence action present - > influences future - > influences expectations future - > … Compared predictable way , , natural world happens present basically brings happens future , social world people ’ views expectations future open-ended , act like ‘ wild card ’ determining causal 10 processes play . means potentially many different ways people might form expectations future.3 Nonetheless , simplify suggest order explain expectations across boom-bust cycles differentiate two types expectations distinguished terms two time dimensions economic values customarily recorded , namely , made periodic , point-in-time terms regard stock-type economic values , assets stocks , made through-time , rates change terms flow-type economic values , involved economic fundamentals . temporal distinction economics uses surely reflects ways people understand time . also reflects two sides boom-bust cycle Soros explains terms interrelated movements stock prices underlying fundamentals . Reflexivity theory applied way , , provides way analyzing economic agents ’ different types expectations according expectations correspond main time dimensions economic values . 3 . First argument : Turning points boom-bust cycles widespread belief reversals explain expectations stock prices expectations fundamentals change relation one another turning points boom-bust cycles ‘ balance ’ order explain turning points phase transitions widespread belief reversals . begin discussion boom-bust cycle phase transition turning point phase transitions often reveal undetected structural features systems visible points dynamics . undetected structural feature case reversal order judgments stock prices fundamentals turning point ends boom inaugurates bust . discussion next section boom , , effect work backwards , analyze expectations stock prices fundamentals could gotten prior state subsequently reverse unravel turning point . 3 effect , engage counterfactual rather Bayesian reasoning facts always reconsidered ( cf . Davis , 2018 ) . 11 Soros ’ boom-bust cycle , saw , three phases : ‘ far-from-equilibrium ’ upswing , phase transition turning point , downswing return ‘ near-equilibrium ’ conditions . turning point – ‘ Minsky moment ’ – clearly connected unexpected change agents ’ beliefs . Arthur argues live “ world belief , strategies , actions agents ‘ tested ’ survival within situation outcome ‘ ecology ’ beliefs , strategies actions together create ” ( Arthur , 2013 , p. 5 ) . ‘ test ’ beliefs examine occurs judgment prediction future form self-fulfilling self-defeating prophecy made causes agents reverse beliefs produces turning point cycle . agents ’ two types expectations , grown increasingly ‘ balance ’ ‘ far-from-equilibrium ’ upswing , unexpectedly get rebalanced toward one another , leading cycle downswing . long history research reflexivity theory self-fulfilling self-defeating prophecies two related forms single kind reflexive judgment potential produce belief shifts . Self-fulfilling self-defeating prophecies defined special type prediction expressed known others cause people change beliefs behavior way either fulfill prediction , predicted would otherwise occurred , overturn defeat prediction , predicted would otherwise occurred . different ordinary sort predictions significantly alter people ’ beliefs alter course events , dominate much economic landscape conventional analysis expectations ‘ near-equilibrium conditions. ’ reflexivity perspective , self-fulfilling self-defeating prophecies especially interesting provide means making phase transitions central analysis capitalist market economies . long capitalist market economies described evolving steady , gradual manner rather system inherently prone unexpected disruptions costly effects people ’ well-being . connection financial markets , whose central role capitalist systems beginning better appreciated , self-fulfilling self-defeating prophecies points us delicate balance institutional structures agents ’ beliefs . suggest , , examination provides useful means investigating range potentially fragile structures capitalist market economies . 12 . Self-fulfilling prophecies self-fulfilling prophecy idea used sociologist Robert K. Merton explain bank runs occurred Depression U.S. 1930s ( Merton , 1949 ) .4 self-fulfilling prophecy involves judgment prediction sets motion reflexive process whereby false belief expressed prediction transformed true belief influence others . Merton ’ hypothetical example , bank analyst reviews bank ’ balance sheet , mistakenly judges bank insolvent , publicly predicts fail . depositors learn , affects beliefs bank ’ future , feeds back behavior present causing withdraw deposits , bank indeed fails , making analyst ’ false belief come true . see two sets expectations involved , notice bank analyst ’ judgment bank ’ solvency ultimately judgment bank ’ stock price high , whereas depositors ’ expectations rather getting money back thus really bank ’ underlying fundamentals . , depositors worried bank ’ stock price indicator safety money . However , bank run directly affects bank ’ fundamentals , feeds changes investors ’ expectations bank ’ stock price . dynamic two sets expectations consequently works change expectations bank ’ fundamentals influences expectations stock price , way around . might seem turning point analyst ’ judgment bank ’ stock price , investors lead . initially effect investors . Indeed , advantage Merton ’ example specifically rules bank analyst makes generally regarded false judgment bank according standards financial community , instead judged bank solvent . bank run change depositor expectations investors judge bank stock price high . Thus , turning point reversal beliefs fundamentals , bank ’ stock price , leads reversal beliefs bank ’ value precipitates downswing . 4 Self-fulfilling prophecies earlier referred social science Thomas theorem : ‘ men define situations real , real consequences ” ( Thomas Thomas , 1928 , pp . 571-2 ) . 13 self-fulfilling prophecy turning point explanation , , also describes 2007-2008 U.S. banking crisis . crisis also essentially began bank run stock market capitalization major U.S. banks declined dramatically , Bear Stearns Lehman Brothers failed , large banks bailed inter-bank lending dried ( Brunnermeier , 2009 ) . crisis , speculators investors regarded banks solvent , dissenters thought wrong analysts financial community , well described Michael Lewis ( Lewis , 2010 ) . Yet dissenters eventually influenced investors began cautious . Inter-bank lending began decline , banks found longer able finance overnight markets , illiquid cases insolvent , fulfilling dissenters ’ ‘ false ’ prophecy . Merton ’ example , , reversal beliefs banks ’ fundamentals , beliefs bank stock market values , led reversal beliefs value banks brought downswing . Merton ’ example case banking crisis , , expectations ‘ balance ’ upswing speculation drove fundamentals rebalanced turning point expectations regarding fundamentals took lead . ii . Self-defeating prophecies Consider symmetrical case self-defeating prophecy , instead something false becoming true , something regarded true becomes false . 5 self-defeating prophecy involves correct judgment prediction sets motion behavior overturns . paradigmatic example often cited Y2K prediction , prediction year 2000 calendar turnover would cause computers crash led governments , businesses , individuals act ways assured would occur thus made prediction false . course , economic agents always combination true false beliefs , thus ‘ tested ’ overturned interaction one another . general crisis , , multiple , interconnected boom-bust cycle turning points wholesale reversal beliefs , need understand true beliefs reversed along false ones . Self- 5 Self-defeating prophecies also referred Oedipus effect Oedipus ’ legendary efforts avoid prophecy future actually helped bring . 14 defeating prophecies also especially important understand , go people ’ ordinary philosophical intuitions true true.6 Y2K case example self-defeating prophecy policies undertaken prevent crisis . However , self-defeating prophecies also produce crises turning points boom-bust cycles , argued connection U.S. housing crisis . Like Merton ’ bank run case , begin judgments occur financial side story . Thus , households analysts housing sector aware households becoming leveraged late 1990s early 2000s believed asset side balance sheets improving higher home prices , thus offsetting expansion liability side due higher mortgage finance requirements . judgment made firms lending households , business media continually claimed housing prices would never fall never fallen , banks sold associated derivative products investors one another model derivative assets superior conventional mortgage assets , credit rating agencies reviewed banks , U.S. Federal Reserve denied bubbles issue financial markets . hindsight , judgments mistaken , point thought true made . effect judgments , however , increase complacency towards risk throughout financial system classic boom style , meant processes involved continued households indeed taken debt incomes could justify . created doubts whether households position finance mortgages ; 6 Self-defeating prophecies sometimes confused self-refuting hypotheses . Self-defeating prophecies predictions causal effects . Self-refuting hypotheses claims arguments said logically contradict . example , Burton Malkiel used idea characterize stock price movements random walk defense efficient markets hypothesis . Technical forecasting methods aim identify trends stock market prices , argued , must self-defeating : “ problem regularity known market participants , people act way prevents happening future ” ( Malkiel , 2003 , p. 168 ) . Sanford Grossman Joseph Stiglitz ’ argument idea informationally efficient markets impossible also regarded example self-refuting hypothesis : markets convey possible information , agents would reason acquire information necessary make efficient ( Grossman Stiglitz , 1980 ) . classic type self-refuting hypothesis self-referential claim contradicts , liar paradox : Epimenides , Cretan , asserted Cretans liars . 15 slowed mortgage finance initially subprime sector , slowed housing price rise ; slowing price increases meant households would also less likely able finance re-finance , slowed lending fueling price rise ; indeed became false household balance sheets secure , thus transforming many formerly believed true judgment one become false . Consequently , self-fulfilling prophecy case , case self-defeating prophecy reversal beliefs fundamentals – instance , household fundamentals – led reversal beliefs household balance sheets brought downswing home prices . iii . turning points booms upswings argument , , phase transition turning point cycle occurs expectations fundamentals shift relative expectations stock prices , rebalancing toward one another become increasingly ‘ balance ’ upswing . occurs exceptional circumstances peak cycle prediction , true false , made financial status stock price agent agents , precipitates wave belief reversals economic fundamentals , precipitates wave belief reversals financial status stock price , together effect reversing truth prediction . However , course predictions unlike self-fulfilling self-defeating prophecies , generate widespread belief reversals reverse truth . , predictions benign belief-preserving rather belief-reversing , accordingly people accustomed understanding prediction less dramatic , ordinary way . Soros ’ reflexivity analysis brings treating ‘ far-from-equilibrium ’ boom-bust cycle positive feedback departure ‘ near-equilibrium ’ conditions driven negative feedback prevail time . turn boom upswing , , misconception believes agents boom also derives departure ordinary view world prediction relatively reliable . following section , explain misconception trace way people ordinarily reason cause-and-effect connection feedback processes general causes misunderstand nature positive feedback processes upswing boom particular . 16 4 . Second argument : expectations get ‘ balance ’ Reflexivity theory assumes people able adjust behavior light expectations future , must understand something nature cause-and-effect processes world live . Otherwise would make sense change present effort change future plays . addition , also fair assume people understand cause-and-effect processes depends evidence past . Accordingly , suppose economic agents operate basic philosophy science reasoning whereby less consciously hypothesize cause-and-effect models economic processes light observation repeated feedback patterns . problem , however , conception fits negative positive feedback patterns fit positive feedback patterns observe economy undergoing significant change past unreliable guide present . leads agents misconceive positive feedback patterns booms economic relationships likely undergoing significant change stable , causes expectations stock prices get increasingly ‘ balance ’ expectations fundamentals . develop argument , first , discuss economic agents likely reason feedback patterns model cause-and-effect relationships , second discuss often neglected asymmetry negative positive feedback patterns , third discuss things together generates misconception booms causes expectations stock prices get increasingly ‘ balance ’ expectations fundamentals . . Feedback patterns repeated reflexivity judgments Reflexivity defined basic terms section two without saying sequence reflexivity judgments might follow repeated feedback pattern . basic idea people ’ views future feed back onto somehow influence behavior present , somehow affects future plays , somehow affects subsequent views future , , Figure 1 . Feedback patterns , however , 17 repeated sequences reflexivity judgments regularity economic agents observe , identify , rely upon hypothesize existence cause-and-effect relationships act upon . Consider relatively predictable positive feedback case firms decreasing costs . view firms future expect increasing production cause unit costs fall . expectation feeds back onto present firms fact increase current production , affects future plays causing prices fall , pattern occurs repeatedly , affects firms ’ view future one rely empirically well identified cause-and-effect relationship increased production lower costs . Thus , feedback pattern involves settled sequence reflexivity judgments provides basis hypothesized cause-and-effect model economic agents . course , models must hypothesized represent unobservable cause-and-effect relationships underlying observations feedback patterns . represent kind reflexive reasoning Figure 2 pertains single cause-and-effect model . downward arrows indicate economic agents believe cause-and-effect modelA repeatedly confirmed , sequence observed effects 1 , 2 , … , n model consistent model predicts . case , agents thus make successive belief-preserving judgments , confident model predicts reasonably well . Figure 2 : Ordinary cause-and-effect reasoning feedback patterns [ cause-and-effect modelA + observed effect1 ] ↙ [ cause-and-effect modelA + observed effect2 ] ↙ … [ cause-and-effect modelA + expected effect n ] 18 , however , evidence support model , happens ? One response agents likely suppose cause-and-effect model replaced cause-and-effect model B new Figure 2 applies . , evidence changes , model must changed . happens Merton ’ example bank analyst making influential judgment bank . case , agents held cause-and-effect model bank ’ continuing take deposits foreseeable future cause bank remaining solvent future . bank analyst ’ judgment , however , led depositors expect bank run , meant cause-and-effect model predicted bank would remain solvent longer applied . leads adoption another model based another sequence reflexivity judgments involving alternative feedback pattern . Depositors expect insolvency future , feeds back onto behavior present increasing current withdrawals , affects future plays terms worsening condition bank , reinforces expectations future , new feedback pattern identifies alternative cause-and-effect model predicts bank ’ collapse . Yet reasoning cause-and-effect models makes sense firm decreasing costs Merton example fit past evidence corresponding models often good , ignores possibility sort reasoning cause-and-effect models inappropriate circumstances economic relationships process change , unstable , largely flux . see case , note negative positive feedback patterns differ ways relate causes effects one another . ii . Negative versus positive feedback patterns Negative feedback , diminishing returns , occurs sort homeostatic self-regulating process operating cause-and-effect relationships sustained largely unchanged form time . repeated pattern , negative feedback occurs successive increases decreases activity always decreasing due feedback loop effects 19 causes dampens force causes . classic example diminishing returns production , feedback loop works decreasing productivity reduced causal effectiveness higher input levels output . process self-regulating sense primary effects – increased output case – always offset secondary effects – reduced incentive increase output . Negative feedback thus fully consistent ordinary cause-and-effect reasoning Figure 2 . repeated effects activity always increase decreasing rate , economic agents reasonably infer nothing happening counts evidence wrong cause-and-effect model . conclusion established process indirect reasoning . activity rather increasing increasing rate causal effects continually growing , would make sense suppose something additionally causing effects beyond causes originally assumed . absence increasing effects , however , removes concern , means reason question way cause effect connected model . illustrate , imagine bank expands balance sheet , withdrawals increase decreasing rate . larger size bank implies higher level withdrawals , occurs decreasing rate , cause-and-effect model bank implies solvency . , however , expansion bank ’ balance sheet leads withdrawals increase increasing rate , many would worry additional set causal forces operating affects withdrawals , thus cause-and-effect model bank solvent might wrong . occur . makes negative feedback patterns consistent Figure 2 , , agents reason think cause-and-effect model identified repeated feedback patterns wrong . Consider positive feedback , increasing returns , involve successive increases decreases activity increasing . distinguished one another terms secondary effects , negative positive feedback processes appear simply opposite one another . fact , asymmetrical relate causes effects one another . negative feedback , repeated effects activity always increase decreasing rate , repeated effects activity always get smaller smaller , economic agents reasonably infer nothing happening cause side 20 relationship overturn cause-and-effect model . However , effects activity always increasing , possibility something additional occurring cause side relationship , thus implying existing cause-and-effect model may longer apply . original model might still apply , increasing effects might mean anything new happening cause side relationship . Nonetheless possibility something new happening ruled . thus important difference two forms feedback increasing effects opens door possibility new causal forces operating , whereas negative feedback diminishing effects involves firmly closes door . time , follow idea ‘ new causal forces ’ might operating simply need replace cause-and-effect model cause-and-effect model B . reflexive social world , occupy , people ’ actions change world . invests change ontological status means underlying relationships investigate always settled state . Economic relationships course stable relatively unchanging , also simply changing flux , case subject explanation employing basic philosophy science reasoning . Thus address examples positive feedback processes well distinguish forms , better , think terms spectrum cases , one end spectrum cases involve significant change economic relationships , ( arguably ) firms decreasing costs increasing shares market production demand schedules still reasonably predictable , end spectrum cases involving wholesale change economic relationships , new technologies introduced transformative effects many markets economic relationships ( Arthur , 1994 ) . course , two ends spectrum differ degree , individual cases surely debated fall spectrum since ‘ change economic relationships ’ include many different types considerations . However , debate – indeed must debate - central important positive feedback compared negative feedback , means exists inherent ambiguity instance positive feedback involves . kind ambiguity different 21 associated standard problem hypothesizing cause-and-effect models evidence . case positive feedback processes falling transformational end spectrum , may body evidence may even exhibit certain regularities , infer model conceived terms stable set underlying relationships represent evidence . , basic philosophy science reasoning cause-and-effect gives inadequate explanation world encounter positive feedback processes fall transformational end spectrum . Nonetheless , standard view undeniable appeal mode reasoning . Given , surprised economic agents rely systematically mistaken booms positive feedback appear govern economic fundamentals . , find evidence views longer supported , expect quickly lose confidence views . Let us use analysis , , explain agents ’ misconceptions upswing boom . iii . Misconceptions upswing boom upswing boom , positive feedback processes stock prices economic fundamentals generate dynamic interconnected sets expectations regarding stock prices fundamentals . Speculative expectations raise stock prices increasing rate , causes economic fundamentals form earnings per share improve increasing rate . influences expectations fundamentals , happens change expectations stock prices changed expectations fundamentals , least turning point cycle influence runs opposite direction . point – ‘ Minsky moment ’ – prior expectations fundamentals re-assert pull expectations stock prices . downswing run course , ‘ near-equilibrium ’ conditions negative feedback processes determine expectations stock prices fundamentals , fundamentals increase decreasing rate determined long run factors , sets expectations adjust accordingly . Essentially , , ‘ far-from-equilibrium ’ experience boom create short-term misconception fundamentals temporarily allows speculative expectations run course realism fundamentals ends boom . 22 , , economic agents become mistaken fundamentals boom expectations adjust traders ’ speculative expectations ? Expectations fundamentals grounded economic performance whereas speculative expectations depend risky bets trader psychologies . former dominant normal course events booms , oddly boom expectations fundamentals depart ‘ near-equilibrium ’ conditions support chase speculative expectations . argument , happens economic agents believe positive feedback processes observing regarding fundamentals upswing represent new , stable cause-and-effect relationships improving earnings per share , rather case underlying cause-and-effect relationships involved unstable changing , justify belief . Economic agents reason traditional philosophy science manner , therefore suppose must underlying cause-and-effect model explain positive feedback patterns observe . Accordingly , doubts emerge models , way explaining situation , default better confirmed status quo ante views fundamentals . illustrate happened 2007-2008 U.S. housing crisis . housing market 1990s early 2000s exhibited positive feedback processes home prices expansion household balance sheets beginning subprime market eventually extending housing . Whatever caused prices start rising first place , speculative expectations developed , led increasing lender finance . improved household fundamentals , thus favorably changed expectations households ’ capacity finance debt , speculative expectations led adjustment expectations household fundamentals . theory economic agents , , ‘ new ’ world expanded household balance sheets secure , home prices rising increasing rate justified household leverage rising increasing rate . empirically observed , , provided grounds hypothesize new underlying cause-and-effect model housing market replaced old banking model traditional household finance prevailed previously conditions negative feedback . Yet later became clear , actually occurring household finance reflect new stable set relationships housing debt household income . Rather situation 23 fully flux households used increased access finance offset incomes weakening since 1980s . household income declining , observed positive feedback story might reflected stable new set relationships , could argued fundamentals long-run value U.S. housing improved . positive feedback pattern could explained short-term adjustment new long-run values established . However , ultimately became clear situation stable household debt rising unsustainably , confidence regarding new underlying model housing disappeared . complacency agents exhibited new underlying model housing worked self-defeating prophecy led increases lending expectations regarding household fundamentals declined , pulled speculative expectations house prices . Thus , misconception economic agents thought world working predictably despite evidence changing . essentially blind evidence implicitly employed philosophy science reasoning regarding causality emphasizes predictability . Indeed employed natural science type causal reasoning rather social science type causal reasoning emphasizing reflexivity . leaves unexplained , however , economic agents vulnerable misconception . philosophy science reasoning overly simplistic quickly underpinning observed empirical regularities hypothetical cause-and-effect models ? answer , suggest , lies well reasoning fits experience much time negative feedback patterns prevail . Negative feedback always consistent cause-and-effect model fitting Figure 2 , economic agents conclude wrong underlying cause-and-effect model , inclined suppose need find right model – think model might exist . inclination reinforced fact boom-bust cycles constitute departure normal , ‘ near-equilibrium ’ course events basic model often explains quite well . Quite simply , , economic agents biased toward seeing world terms negative feedback processes , blinds need able explain positive feedback processes associated transformational change economy . 24 5 . Boom-bust cycles nature reflexive economic agents paper developed reflexivity understanding interdependent expectations interacting adaptive economic agents financial markets connection boom-bust cycles . Reflexivity operates feedback loop people ’ expectations future interaction feed back influence current actions strategies current actions strategies feed forward influence future interaction . think terms two interacting sets expectations , explain boom-bust cycles dynamically according feedback processes cause different sets expectations change relation one another across cycle single evolving structure interaction . argument paper first addressed turning points , reveal structure interaction set interdependent expectations boom-bust cycle , second argument misconception agents upswing cycle goes deeper issue , namely , agents blind causes cycle . Though answer may seem behavioral economics type explanation , less people perceive world , stability economic relationships gives precedence basic philosophy science view . Central whole analysis , case , paper ’ conception reflexive economic agents seen adaptive interactive . adaptive , behavior needs explained terms embedded time ; interactive , behavior needs explained terms socially embedded . two characteristics contrast mainstream atomistic agent view rejects characteristics . surprisingly , mainstream economics neither complex evolutionary . surprisingly , mainstream framework fails explain recurring crises financial fragility disruptive costly people ’ lives . Thus , one motivation paper ’ argument assumption adequate explanations capitalist market economies depend first adequate conceptions economic agents inhabit economies . paper makes one step direction connection analysis boom-bust cycles . 25 Acknowledgements : author grateful comments previous version paper David Colander , Wolfram Elsner , Wade Hands , discussions regarding reflexivity Nicolas Brisset , Barkley Rosser , George Soros , Brian Arthur , Eric Beinhocker , Alan Kirman assistance thinking complexity .
