Robert Lucas , Nobel Laureate economics , triumphantly stressed tempestuous times belong-ing past macroeconomics succeeded : central problem depression prevention solved , practical purposes , fact solved many decades ( Lucas 2003:1 ) . traumatising impact 2008–2009 global financial economic crisis forced economics profession ‘ stop word ’ . embarrassing question Queen England ‘ nobody see crisis 2008 coming ’ emblematically signalled failure collective imagination entire profession understand system emerging patterns . hardly chance prominent scholars , Nobel-Prize winners Thomas J. Sargent Christopher Sims asked dinner Nobel Prize ceremony 2011 lifeworks convey recent crisis , answer nothing silence . become clear fire station burns , models become insufficient time enormous instabilities . Consequently , light annoyingly unanswered questions , growing incredulity prevailing economics ( Csaba 2009 ; Coyle 2012 ; Zingales 2013 ; Galbraith 2014 ; PCES 2014 ; Keen 2017 ) .Our paper proposes audacious claim questions em-barrassing , also unanswerable due limited understanding em-beddedness complex system live . example , remove Greece Eurozone help debt-ridden country remain ? Shall increase EU budget create funds build transfer system ? important proper crisis management , fiscal monetary policy ? Shall state inject ever-more financial support economy spark digital transfor-mation even though productivity growth secularly declining despite unprecedented level digitization today ? regions ( advanced less developed ) primarily targeted via state transfers sup-port programmes taking account side-effect increasing inequalities well limited fiscal room maneouvre ? really rationale support pick gazelles ( fast-growing firms ) , though late comer also advantageous firm macroeconomy exaptation ? COMPLEXITY ECONOMICS 573Acta Oeconomica 69 ( 2019 ) even called thorough revision economics restore beacon role understanding really going economy . paper , without exhaustive , demonstrate crises scandals mean science economics shade intrinsic failure . problems occurred ignored knew economic system merely cherishing deeply ingrained seductive assumptions . corollary , complexity-aware economics blatantly needed better map interactions grasping heaven hell really going on.2 . PARMENIDES HERACLITUS – COMPLEXITY COMPLEXITY SCIENCE ? dawn civilisation , mankind seeking wanting see cer-tainty . time classical science questions like ‘ events remain without substantial repercussions ? ’ , ‘ kinds interactions shape entire functioning big system ? ’ ‘ event repel us towards irre-versible changes ? ’ never occured across board . time , analysing laws res extensa , say , natural ( physical ) world res cogitans ( world human mind ) dominating logical consequences assum-ing determinism timelessness ( time-reversibility ) together stability equilibrium . fact , ideology summoned central worldview ancient Greek philosopher Parmenides resolutely arguing change impos-sible kinds existence universe timeless . Cartesian Zeitgeist gave impression certainty everything , since certainty equals truth , ultimate goal science find truths ( universal laws ) .1There three interlinked assumptions grounding classical science . First determinism equilibrium . Laplace ’ famous demon equipped lapis philosophorum overlook ex ante ex post system predict future . gave misleading feeling comfort time ( consequence : irreversibil-ity negligible ) , thus concentrating structures rather also involving processes relationships instructive way forward . Second reduc-tionism , builds great extent Aristotelian Ockhamian logic , 1 Let us recall mechanistic atomic worldview Pierre Gassendi Galileo Galilei 17th century , thought universe written language mathematics , hence measurement inevitably everything world fully de-scribed known 3-4 maximum 5 fundamental laws ( e.g . Newton ’ laws mechan-ics ( 1686 ) , Maxwell ’ laws electrodynamics ( 1864 ) , Boltzman ’ laws thermodynamics ( 1872/1875 ) , Einstein ’ general relativity theory ( 1905 , 1915 ) , laws quantum me-chanics ( Schrödinger , Heisenberg Max Born ) ) .574 OLIVÉR KOVÁCSActa Oeconomica 69 ( 2019 ) namely theories must case embrace things possible . also assumed whole completely knowable via analysing parts per se . Third separability disjunction , critical boost development silo-thinking ( i.e . evolvement specific hermetising scientific disci-plines intention obtain ideas knowledge outside walls ) . Albeit another Greek philosopher Heraclitus , whose ideology dy-namism constant time-depentent change diametrical opposition Parmenidesian logic , worldview lurking shadow sci-entific development centuries waiting re-discovered . lega-cy Parmenidesian worldview traceable conceptual frameworks quantum mechanics well theory relativity ignoring arrow time irreversibility principle described comprehensively later interdisciplinary researchers2 ( i.e . preferred direction time , time-reversal symmetry quantum mechanics , spacetime continuum general relativity ) . Natural sciences allied together find unified theory everything ( connecting micro-world ’ laws macro-world ) , seems futile undertaking structural procedurial complex changes also considered . long time , equilibrium-centric view understanding underlying core assumptions indicated ne-glected de rigeuer aspect non-equilibrium interspersed interactions emergence complex systems.3 Thus , complexity based scientific ap-proach started unfold system thinkers great inertia.4 Parmenides represented statism ( ) , Heraclitus manifests sys-tem thinkers incorporating dynamism change ( becoming ) . Systemic think-ing gained traction 20th century vigorous way inter alia organismic biology , Gestalt psychology , chemical kinetics , ecology , complexity-informed sociology even economics . Since natural social sciences deal living systems alike , analysis relationships among parts started garner much attention time , especially structural change better understood . 2 oeuvre Ilya Prigogine ( 1945 , 1984 , 1987 ) , Nobel-laureate chemistry , exemplifies . research continuously castigated prominent representatives narrow discipline , work proves interesting findings come starting siege conventional walls particular field.3 , increasing body evidence arrow time , , relative nature arrow time ( Haramein et al . 2016 ) .4 term ’ complexity ’ gained momentum mainly information theory , general systems theo-ry Norbert Wienerian cybernetics , however , scholars still idolized cult discipli-nary narrowness . See works von Neumann von Foerster , comprehensive account hysteresis Morin ( 2007 ) . COMPLEXITY ECONOMICS 575Acta Oeconomica 69 ( 2019 ) Briefly succinctly , complexity means dependent entanglement among large number parts continuously interacting . complex system , macro patterns emerging interactions constituent agents ( examples complex systems universe , climate , living-organisms , eco-systems , human cognition system , society culture , organisations , cities , traffic , etc. ) . Let us note well defined coherent complexity science nonexist-ent category . Still , amalgams concepts deciphered along decades-long course complexity thinking various fields dealing systems . warp woof concepts complexity science , least , juxtaposed follows .

Prigogine ( 1984 ) claimed , irreversibility time mechanism brings order chaos , chaos , unstable order . concept ergodicity de-veloped cultivated time mechanistic worldview , especially statistical mechanics overcome problems . See works Birkhoff ( 1931 ) von Neumann ( 1932 ) , came conclusion.576 OLIVÉR KOVÁCSActa Oeconomica 69 ( 2019 ) Without exhaustive , elaborated features complex systems many important implications broad array scientific fields .

Unfortunately , economics inclined think nouns ( i.e . long-lasting structures ) instead verbs ( changing processes in-teractions system ) long time Parmenidesian sense . economy primarily considered complex , complicated system totally understood governed relying simplified stylised models , 12 hardly chance Heisenberg stated ( 1958 : 65 ) “ world thus appears complicated tissue events , connections different kinds alternate overlap combine thereby determine texture whole. ” 13 Since complexity science amalgam different approaches gradient to-wards dynamic systems constantly evolving properties patterns , theories concepts adaptable social inquiry . See Byrne – Callagham ( 2013 ) .578 OLIVÉR KOVÁCSActa Oeconomica 69 ( 2019 ) based methods natural sciences ( e.g . physics ) , applied closed economy particular sector . Still , one find dissonant voices works promi-nent scholars economists.14Thinking basic questions Adam Smith ( wealth come , wealth distributed ) , Léon Walras turned economic approach dominated mathematical language simply firm belief perfect free competition requiring abstract presumptions ( e.g . trade equilib-rium ) disregarding reality production process.15 Compared Walras , Alfred Marshall recognised fundamental flawness Walras ( others ) made : “ may well insist assume competition per-fect . Perfect competition requires perfect knowledge state market [ … ] ” ( Marshall 1920 : 540–541 ) . Despite still abstract assumptions , Marshall tried capture trading process real time denying relevance far-from equilibrium . Nevertheless , contribution still bias towards considering partial equilibrium , merely . Joseph A.

Nonetheless , economists time still approach eco-nomic issues mathematically coherent way ( building assumptions rationality , general equilibrium ) .16 Schumpeter ’ innovation therefore con-sidered mainsteam economists exogenous variable ( works taught Berkeley ) .14 Ha-Joon Chang emphasised conference Budapest , Hungary March 2018 : third 9 major schools economics look world complex uncertain sys-tem .

Unsurprisingly , due inexhaust-ible complexity ecosystem , Hayekian view favours rule-following cautious governance extensive discretionalism ( i.e . avoiding pretence perfect complete knowledge essence case complexity 17 theories would totally neglect nuances world psyche people ( things people unintended negative consequences departing system equi-librium invalidating universal theories ) . world must , John Stuart Mill emphasised ( Mill 1859|2001 : 89 ) , mix different opinions , perceptions individuality deliberated pursued reach wellbeing . organically brings fluctuations system.18 Seeking ’ laws ’ complex systems , economics deal , futile undertaking whole aspiration probably result inductivism .

Even remarks Keynes instant immediate effect overly sanguine view using compara-tive statism questioned approach calling incorpora-tion complex incommensurable magnitudes ( Keynes 1930 , 1971 ) ( i.e . take account dynamism fluctuations ( emergence ) generated mainly heterogeneous expectations various agents , intrinsic difficulty quanti-fication complex open system leading limited knowledge , organic interdependence network agents tend show ’ animal spirits ’ creating instabilities20 ) .21 Still , time , equilibrium stability centric views mainstream remained resistant considerations . Nonetheless , years later , Ferrari-Filho Conceição ( 2005 ) Rosser ( 2006 ) pointed , post-keynesian economists institutionalists started enshrine idea dis-equilibrium central importance fundamental uncertainty.In addition , classical postulate rational expectations without discordants even birth concept , either . True , term coined Muth ( 1961 ) seminal paper concept put centre neoclassical synthesis mainstraim economic models , Muth Nobel-laureate system thinker , Herbert A. Simon , explicitly expressed concerns huge discrepancy theoretical rational ex-pectations way economy actually works.22 Despite growing body evidence shortcoming concept , lived mainstream life later ( mainly assuming must rational expectations aggregate level society , however , model far could properly address learning process whereby assumed convergence rational expec-tations equilibrium emerge ) .23It lasted decades profession started consider agents ( indi-viduals , households , firms , even institutions ) rational players mere-ly limited local knowledge.24 example , although Kenneth Arrow touted one influential founders developers mathematical econom-ics interspersed equilibrium orientation , often neglected work time pervaded soupçon alarming noting limitations 20 incredulity approach Keynes might importance , however , criticism must refined notes considered Chapter 18 General Theory , Keynes admits variables constantly changing , “ hence extreme complexity actual course events ” ( Chapter 18 : 249 ) . 21 Keynes ( 1936|1973 , 1921|1973 , 1930|1971 ) .22 Simon ( 1962 , 1978 ) .23 depends whether positive negative expectations feedbacks considered ( Assenza et al . 2014 : 61 ) . 24 See agent-based literature Epstein ( 2007 ) LeBaron ( 2006 ) .COMPLEXITY ECONOMICS 581Acta Oeconomica 69 ( 2019 ) rational expectations claiming satirically people must superior statisticians future general equilibrium ( Arrow 1978:157–169 ) .25 unde-servingly underrated contribution regard Krupp ( 1966 ) , whose essays acknowledged complexity ( unknowables ) vigorous way , Kenneth E.

Kydland , Edward C. Prescott , Thomas J. Sargent Robert M. Townsend made general equilibrium central macr-oeconomic thinking . However , real performance models remained abysmally low , especially advent oil crises . econo-mists proposing prevailing macroeconomic thinking broadened ( e.g . taking account nominal rigidities interest rate instrument , including also distortions , etc . ) , flair , turn , rather moderated 25 addition , Arrow tried ‘ arrow time ’ stimulating younger scholars start thinking modelling asymmetric information perfect competiton framework .

Beyond tilting windmills – towards Heraclitusian EconomicsAs Heraclitus argued , opposition brings concord . However , whether former present-day system-minded economists jointly overcome tilting wind-mills triggering paradigm shift fiendishly resistant mainstream eco-nomics still open question . Based partly upon previous historical over-view argue shifting towards complexity economics inevitable 35 example , see stream imperfect knowledge economics marshalled Roman Fryd-nam Michael D.

See : Krueger – Duncan ( 1993 ) recognised feedback loops leading complex regulation . 45 Kovács ( 2017 ) demonstrates fostering Industry 4.0 China encoding inefficiency via rent-seeking . 46 living system never full equilibrium , except dead . Thus , living system , society , dissipative system far-from equilibrium , system per se also seen self-organised critical system ( Kron – Grund 2009 ; Scheffer 2009 ) , means structure system remains long time despite constant flow change components , critical state emerges creating qualitatively new structure.47 Beinhocker ( 2006 ) envisaged gargantuan paradigmatic change occuring econom-ics . True , degree interdisciplinarity increasing ( Angrist et al . 2017ab ) , com-plexity-based policy approach outlining ( OECD 2017 ) , courses econom-ics streamlined ( Bowles 2017 ) , CORE programme , http : //econ-core.org.COMPLEXITY ECONOMICS 587Acta Oeconomica 69 ( 2019 ) charge , one fully scientifically properly overlook ex ante whole system effects actions imposed complexity . , therefore , fool-proof silver bullet wicked problems . Moreover , open , dynamic socio-economic innovation ecosystem nature code filled elementary universal laws . seems reached end big theories.48 economics profession practitioners consider economy complex system , newfangled economic governance refined policy mix shall emerge49 humble way building knew still learn complexity . argue changing course toward Heraclitusian Economics – interdisciplinary appreciates features complex dy-namic systems , interactions , dynamic configuration processes , non- equilibrium , fundamental uncertainty ( unknown unknowns , unexpectedness ) , emergence patterns , etc . – inevitable shall accompanied pursuing contingency governance . paper means aim drawing comprehensive policy roadmap , lay basic principles gov-ernance follows.Enhancing stability trust dynamics : Without trust , kind economic governance fall short political instability . end , fol-lowing sub-principles pursued contingency governance : modesty , decentralisation , collaborative horizontal mindset , experimentalism . Since uncertainty new norm calls modesty goals ability/capacity via economic policy . Fatal conceit reduced modesty bolstered decentralisation . higher degree decentralised gov-ernance , fertile ground given closer society transparent way leading intensive collaboration . Collaborative hori-zontal ( interdisciplinary , interdepartmental ) mindset therefore cultivat-ed ( i.e . accepting single-purpose governance entities departments silo-thinking longer capable great help , collaboration mechanism make things sustainable ) . way , building literature higher decentralisation/federalism , efficient faster social learning initiated via series parallel innovations smart adaptations reinforces enhances trust infrastructure . 48 Endism also raised stream economics literature decades ago , namely devel-opment economics ( Bookstaber 2017 ; Musto 1986 ) .49 Colander – Kupers ( 2016 ) led similar conclusion , still presupposing con-vergence towards equilibrium.588 OLIVÉR KOVÁCSActa Oeconomica 69 ( 2019 ) Considerately promoting dynamism innovation ecosystem : Complex-ity science nourishes message , beyond stability , society needs amplifi-cation , fluctuation emergence leading qualitative structural change . candidate sub-principles regard follows : festina lente , systems view , differential diagnosis , equability . appearance fourth indus-trial revolution ( i.e . cyberphysical systems smart factories ancillary technologies ) , principle make haste slowly ( festina lente ) together principle system thinking order unclear unintended con-sequences trade-offs development gives rise system ( concerns feasibility proper cybersecurity ; impacts consumption patterns ; concerns use Big Data nowcasting methods informing really happening ; impact digitalisation well automation em-ployment , people ’ mental state , etc. ) .

Promoting bottom-up character dynamism manifest cultivating eq-uability ( dampening extreme income wealth inequality also outbalanc-ing unfolding individual opportunities ) whereby inclusiveness , talents , therefore , innovativeness also promoted giving new e ’ lan system ’ dynamics.Breeding resilience socio-economic innovation ecosystem : outlined characteristics complex systems calls modern economic governance equipped capacities absorbing shocks , bouncing back ( i.e . better in-formed fiscal monetary policies50 buffers tandem provid-ing necessary latitude navigate uncertainty ; rebuilding progres-sive tax systems rethinking well retailoring automatic stabilisers involving aspect supporting research development innovation ) , last least , transmogrifying dynamic configura-tion via putting lessons learnt practice ( i.e . admitting fact structural reforms mechanisms directing towards equilibrium , perpetual 50 building new tools methods complexity narrative techniques , network anal-ysis , evolutionary logic , qualitative scenario thinking , non-linear dynamics , historical analysis ( reverse ) stress testing .

Without pursuing complexity based economic approach52 , without acknowledging individual system-wide interactions ( least ) , macroeconomics may indeed doomed policies tend fall short becoming insturments sustainable develop-ment value-congruent governance kind governance cacophony ideas nothing theater empty rhetoric . end , us consider complexity economics research pro-gram rather singular theory.REFERENCESAbad , J . – ’ Errico , M. – Killeen , N. – Luz , V. – Peltonen , T. – Portes , R. – Urbano , T.
