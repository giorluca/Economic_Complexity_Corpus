Inoua Chapman University inoua @ chapman.edu version : 20211 Abstract . conventional view economic development simplifies country ’ production one aggregate variable , GDP . Yet product diversification matters economic development , recent , data-driven , “ economic complexity ” research suggests . country ’ product diversity reflects country ’ diversity productive knowhow , “ capabilities ” . Researchers derive algorithms ( inspired network theory ) measures number capabilities economy , notably Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) , argued predict economic growth better traditional variables human capital ; country Fitness index , argued remedy limitations ECI . paper offers alternative economic complexity measure ( founded information theory ) derives simple model production combinatorial process whereby set capabilities combine probability transform raw materials product . country ’ number capabilities given logarithm product diversity , predicts model , also predicts linear dependence log-diversity , ECI , log-fitness . model ’ predictions fit empirical data well ; informational formulation , argue , natural , unifying , theoretical framework complexity view economic development . Keywords : economic growth , economic development , product diversification , economic complexity metrics . 1 Thoroughly updated version , using recent data containing comment ( Subsection 2.3 ) orthogonality economic complexity product diversity , discussed recent literature . 2 1 Background 1.1 Product Diversification Matters Economic Development Contrary long tradition economics according international prosperity achieved national economies specialize , product diversity strongly correlated economic development [ 1-6 ] . “ richest ” countries make almost types products , rudimentary sophisticated ones ; “ poorest ” countries make comparatively fewer rudimentary products ( Table 1 ) .2 Table 1 .

Figure 2 . Network Model Production . Countries make products using capabilities : ( ) country-capability-product network . ( B ) country-product network . Capabilities directly observable : count ? Thus , possible infer amount productive knowledge involved economy product diversification data . Researchers framed problem terms network theory , modeling countries ’ productions tripartite network connecting countries products make , products capabilities production requires , countries capabilities possess ( Figure 2 ) . Thus , core problem network approach production conceived one reconstructing partly unobservable country-product-capability network empirically observed bipartite country-product projection [ 16 , 17 ] . Researchers conceived algorithms effect , notably Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) , , authors argue , predict economic growth better traditional variables human capital [ 16 , 17 ] . ECI jointly computed Product Complexity Index ( PCI ) algorithm akin 6 web search engine Google uses rank webpages.7Another algorithm produces alternative country product complexity measures [ 20 ] , named country Fitness ( F ) product Quality ( Q ) . algorithms presented shortly .

First , product transformed natural resources , raw materials applied set knowhows turn economically valuable outcome . Second , fundamentally , knowledge comes discrete elementary units , bits capabilities , combine make sophisticated knowledge . Therefore , country possessing K capabilities make potentially 2KD products , whose sophistications range zero natural resources ( sold raw ) K. Thus , total amount knowhow K involved country ’ production given country ’ log-diversification ( scaling constant ) . However , random combination capabilities makes sense coherent set productive knowledge ; yet easy show ( Subsection 4.4 ) basic conclusion still holds assume realistically set capabilities combine probability transform raw material valuable product : thus , product ’ technological sophistication measured product ’ probability occurrence , log-ubiquity . Moreover , one show ( Subsection 4.2 ) number capabilities economy makes product log ( ) , log ( 1 ) DK ( 7 ) combinatorial model predicts following relationships three country ’ output complexity measures fit data well ( Figure 3-Figure 4 ) :10 log mean ( log ) .std ( log ) DECID ( 8 ) log log.mean ( log ) mean ( log ) F DF ( 9 ) 10 “ Std ” stands standard deviation . metrics systematically compared standardized form ( namely z-scores ) figures , unless otherwise indicated scale plot . 8 Figure 3 .

One show bias log-diversity due raw materials relatively small , since country buy countries raw materials needs ( Subsection 4.4 ) ; correction log-rarity bias due raw materials significant , emphasize explicitly . probability country ’ making product technological sophistication ( S-product short ) precisely , probability country possesses required skillset , multiplied probability country possesses ( acquire ) natural resources required raw material : prob ( -product ) prob ( raw materials ) .SS ( 15 ) Thus , product ’ sophistication given ( multiplicative constant fixing unit measurement product sophistication ) formula : 12 logprob ( -product ) logprob ( raw materials ) .S ( 16 ) assume homogeneity world economy regards production ( , countries differ technologies natural-resource endowments ) , probabilities extend world economy viewed sample space .

Contrary spreading interpretation [ 22 , 23 , 26 ] , however , orthogonality two vectors , reminded , merely implies two vectors linearly dependent ( linearity taken strict mathematical sense , 11 subsection interlude suggested growing , yet erroneous , interpretation orthogonality complexity diversity seems call question dependence , therefore likely slightly misdirect research field . 15 excludes affine dependence , inclusion intercept ) . Orthogonality complexity diversity incompatible positive dependence two vectors : contrary , orthogonality combined positive dependence merely put constraint average complexity . Thus 20k 20s u combined 2cov ( , ) 0k 2cov ( , ) 0s u ( taken well-established empirically theoretically ) simply imply 2mean ( ) 0.k ( 19 ) 2mean ( ) 0.s ( 20 ) Since orthogonality true mathematically , sign condition ( 19 ) - ( 20 ) simply reflects dependence complexity diversity , strong already know , sign conditions singly confirm ( Figure 6 ) . 16 Figure 6 .

However , curious fact world distribution knowhow shape ( increasing probability function ) , suggests relatively mild cross-country variation productive knowhow : higher levels productive knowhow tend frequent . suggests non-neglectable portion cross-country income disparity accounted terms similarly large disparities productive knowhow : least threshold beyond economic development involves determinants knowhow.13 13 important point , generally economic implications model , postponed follow-up paper , contains growth accounting terms two dimensions production ( diversity intensity output ) , sketched earlier draft paper , expanded subtlety . 21 4 Method : Data Model 4.1 Data principle , complexity view growth requires simple accessible data ( country , list products makes ) , yet available , however ; thus , researchers take proxy countries ’ product lists , countries ’ export lists . inevitably error centering analysis export data ( lack detailed data production ) , bias proved minor posteriori , given accuracy results : apparently , country ’ export mix representative total output ’ composition . results presented throughout paper based proxy matrix : 1 0,0 X 0 , cpcpcpXM ( 23 ) cpX amount country c exported product , p using Comtrade data HS ( revision 2007 ) , available years 1995-2018 [ 28 ] .14 also use comparison Comtrade data SITC ( revision 2 ) compiled corrected mistakes Feenstra et al . available years 1962-2000 [ 29 ] .
