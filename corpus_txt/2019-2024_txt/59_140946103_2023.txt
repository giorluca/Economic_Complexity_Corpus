Theoretical framework , data , model specification 3.1 . Theoretical framework section explains analytical process economic complexity index , energy productivity , production renewable energy electricity , ecological patents affect carbon-zero aim . ECI , indicates degree expertise proficiency necessary manufacturing products trade abroad , determines economic progress country [ 9 ] . Transitioning higher productivity low-productivity agriculture-based economy industries results shift moderate advanced economic complexity , results complex goods [ 55 ] . Complexity economy describes production arrangement , corresponds energy use environmental influences . Besides , country ’ production structure may stimulate ecological footprints , product complexity may cause environmental pollution [ 60,61 ] . Theoretically , economic complexity linked structural shifts raise energy demand , increases ECFP environmental deterioration [ 62 ] . Nevertheless , cases , ECI helps create eco-friendly environment due associa-tion change economy ’ structure , mirroring degree abilities , knowledge , high-tech innovations entrenched produc-tion [ 63 ] . Hence , based theory , ECI predicted either negative positive impact ecological footprint . Energy productivity perceived credible criterion evaluating nation ’ level energy efficiency [ 64 ] . EPD also shows nation compares others basis economic envi-ronmental concerns . Thus , energy productivity determines quantity energy used produce one unit production [ 65 ] . addition , energy productivity lowers ecological footprint decreasing amount energy used manufacturing per unit production bringing energy expenses [ 66 ] . Similarly , clean energy electricity reduces pollution utilizing renewable energy sources broaden power generation , cut prices , produce sustainable electricity supply [ 58 ] . Furthermore , renewable energy sources thought carbon-free significant response addressing environmental problems [ 67 ] . Furthermore , utilizing electricity generated renewable sources increase production efficiency , stimulate economic development , reduce negative environmental pollution [ 68 ] . Thus , renewable energy elec-tricity generation supposed contribute carbon-zero goal . Technological advancement might viewed trigger needed alter economic industrial infrastructure guarantee renewable energy used effectively emerging nations . Addi-tionally , eco-innovations energy sector acknowledged facilitator changeover using dirty cleaner sources energy , enables significant reduction emissions connected energy usage [ 69 ] .
