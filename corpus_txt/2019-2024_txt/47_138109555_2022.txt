Another difference matrix reconstruction GENEPY based relies two eigenvectors N , whereas method , also based MC , exploits typically much larger number left-singular/right-singular vectors build reconstructed matrix , application MC . choice number pairs made automatically adopted validation procedure . comparative results available Supplementary material different years aggregation levels.Differences GENEPY indices based original incidence matrix M̂ ( MC ) . Another potential use MC predict missing values trade dataset , similar way Metulini et al.14 . Missing values amount around 25 % entries matrix . implies using , originally NaN entries matrix , corresponding values frequent classifications derived MC . test reliable approach , section , compare values GENEPY index value GENEPY computed using surrogate matrix M̂ ( MC ) , say ̂GENEPY ( MC ) .To quantify correlation GENEPY rankings computed based M̂ ( MC ) , respectively , evaluated Kendall rank correlation coefficient τk . statistical test produced τk ≃ 0.8 p-value near 0 , rejecting significantly null hypothesis independence GENEPY ̂GENEPY ( MC ) . exceptions ( China , France , Italy , UK Germany ) complex country according GENEPY , higher difference GENEPY ̂GENEPY ( MC ) .
