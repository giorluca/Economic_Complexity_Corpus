Furthermore , findings suggest several distortionary sector-level effects increasing regulatory complexity taking place . instance , markedly lower labour intensity decreased sector-level investment rates , confirm greater regulatory complexity entails non-trivial sector-level costs . Distortionary effects regulatory complexity materialise compositional differences , mainly form reduced wages lower investment rate.On second front , using data employment firms ’ characteristics , show negative impact regulatory complexity concentrated smaller younger firms . finding supports hypothesis greater regulatory complexity imposes burden small less experienced firms less able handle . sector level , manufacturing sectors negatively affected . may related higher investment required sectors.Keywords : sectoral regulation , regulatory complexity , economic sectors , structural policies , employment.JEL classification : K2 , R11 , J00 , E02.ResumenEn este documento se estudia por primera vez el impacto de la complejidad regulatoria escala sectorial en España en diversas medidas de eficiencia económica . El análisis se fundamenta en una innovadora base de datos que ha clasificado 206.777 normas españolas , tanto por sector de actividad como por comunidades autónomas , que pone de manifiesto el creciente volumen de regulación , así como su diversidad por sector , escala geográfica por etapa del ciclo económico.Estudiamos en primer lugar los impactos económicos de la complejidad de la regulación sectorial de forma agregada en la relación empleo-población , las horas de trabajo totales , las participaciones sectoriales en el PIB , la intensidad de trabajo la intensidad de capital . En segundo lugar , ahondamos en los impactos heterogéneos observados sobre las empresas con diferentes tamaños edades , haciendo uso de una rica base de datos escala empresarial : la Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales . En el primer caso , estimamos un conjunto de especificaciones con efectos fijos múltiples través de 13 sectores económicos , 23 clasificaciones legales por sector las 17 comunidades autónomas durante el período 1995-2020 . La evidencia sugiere que una mayor complejidad regulatoria tiene un efecto negativo sobre la tasa de empleo un impacto negativo sobre el valor añadido . El efecto sobre el empleo es coherente con los hallazgos previos para Estados Unidos . En concreto , cada aumento del índice de la complejidad de regulación adicional se asocia con una caída del 0,7 % en la cuota de empleo escala sectorial , ceteris paribus . Además , nuestros resultados sugieren que se están produciendo varios efectos distorsionadores escala sectorial : la intensidad de la mano de obra es notablemente menor las tasas de inversión disminuyen como respuesta al aumento de regulación . Estos efectos distorsionadores se materializan través de las diferencias de composición , principalmente mediante la reducción de los salarios de la tasa de inversión.En el segundo caso , utilizando datos desagregados de empleo según las características de las empresas , mostramos que el impacto negativo de la complejidad de la regulación se concentra en las empresas más pequeñas jóvenes . Así pues , este hallazgo apoya la hipótesis de que una normativa más compleja impone una carga que las empresas pequeñas con menos experiencia están menos capacitadas para manejar . escala sectorial , el grupo de sectores más afectado es el manufacturero . Esto puede estar relacionado con la mayor inversión requerida en esos sectores.Palabras clave : regulación sectorial , complejidad de la regulación , sectores de actividad , políticas estructurales , empleo.Códigos JEL : K2 , R11 , J00 , E02.BANCO DE ESPAÑA 7 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 23121 Introduction 1.1 .
