L ’ AI è un ’ area di informatica che enfatizza la creazione di macchine intelligenti che funzionano e reagiscono come gli umani . Alcune delle attività che computer con AI possono progettate includono : riconoscimento vocale , apprendimento , pianificazione , problem solving e set fuzzy . Negli ultimi 15 anni , Amazon , Google e altri hanno sfruttato l ’ apprendimento automatico per il loro enorme vantaggio commerciale . L ’ apprendimento automatico alla base dell ’ AI è la pratica dell ’ uso di algoritmi per analizzare dati al fine di fare una determinazione una previsione su qualche fenomeno . La modellazione fuzzy ci aiuta ad affrontare fenomeni inclusi parametri e le condizioni incerti , ci fornisce strumenti per modellare il sistema considerato nel mondo reale e avvicinarci molto più al suo comportamento . Il set fuzzy , quindi , rappresneta una classe di oggetti con un continuum di gradi di appartenenza . Il quadro sopra descritto ci dà un modo naturale di affrontare fenomeni così imprecisi , quando le classi di oggetti mancano di criteri precisi di adesione per loro elementi . Il contesto da consideare terreno fertile scientico concerne la gestione della complessità dei moderni sistemi antropici socio-economici ( Città , Aree urbane e il loro sviluppo socio-sostenibile ) .
