IntroductionThe notion Economic Complexity ( EC ) widely used encompass aset methods characterize productive technological composition ofarXiv:2308.07172v1 [ econ.GN ] 14 Aug 2023Economic complexity sustainability transition 2economies ( countries , regions , cities ) relying complex systems science ( Hidalgo andHausmann , 2009 ; Tacchella et al. , 2012 ) . EC methods proved particularlyeffective predicting future patterns economic growth using information onthe export basket countries ( Tacchella et al. , 2018 ) . key intuition behindthe EC approach economic development growth result ofthe specialization diversification patterns economies , emerge fromunderlying hidden interactions elements society ( Balland et al.,2022 ; Pugliese et al. , 2019a ) . specifically , EC focuses role playedby accumulation ( unobserved ) productive technological capabilities indriving economic diversification growth ( Hausmann et al. , 2007 , 2011 ; Puglieseet al. , 2017 ; Sbardella et al. , 2018b ) . preserving information economiesproduce , rather merely much , EC literature able “ describe andcompare economies manner eschews aggregation ” ( Hausmann Hidalgo,2011 ) . EC approach yields complementary perspective several domains ofeconomically relevant human activity ( e.g . trade , technical innovation , scientificresearch ) respect conventional ( i.e . aggregate ) indicators productiveinputs performance . emphasis content activity baskets ofcountries regions resonates approaches economics understandeconomic growth lens sectoral allocation productive factors , asthe structuralist literature ( Prebisch , 1950 ; Lewis , 1954 ; Hirschman , 1958 ; Lin et al.,2011 ) , identify role capabilities main factor driving innovation , embodied evolutionary economics literature ( Nelson Winter , 1982 ; Dosiand Nelson , 1994 ; Teece Pisano , 1994 ; Cimoli Dosi , 1995 ) .The quality diversity economy ’ productive technological portfoliohave broader implications simply economic growth . instance , thecomposition economic technological specialization strong implications forthe environment , footprint different products technologies differsubstantially . token , accumulation technological capabilities mayput countries trajectories mitigate exacerbate current climatecrisis . respect , EC methods prove particularly useful understand andguide sustainable transition.The transition towards sustainable low-carbon socio-economicsystem top policy priority , EU Green Deal aiming climate neutralityEconomic complexity sustainability transition 3by 20501 , Inflation Reduction Act United States ( Bistline et al. , 2023 ) andthe ambitious renewable energy targets China ( Lo , 2014 ) . However , decarbonizingthe economy phasing polluting energy-intensive industries requireradical transformations profound structural change core socio-economicsystems . Moreover , account heterogeneous capacity ofgeographical areas industries achieve climate neutrality along possiblelong-lasting effects income , spatial environmental inequalities.To inform policy address complex transformation , whereingeographical , structural institutional elements interact , last yearsan approach emerged literature ( see among others Barbieri et al. , 2020,2022 ; Montresor Quatraro , 2020 ; Santoalha Boschma , 2021 ) drawsfrom sustainability studies , evolutionary economic geography ( Boschma Frenken,2006 , 2018 ) EC . Embracing complexity perspective may fact moreeffective traditional approaches accounting interconnected natureof process change ( Common Stagl , 2005 ) providing policy-relevant , data-driven granular evidence embrace socio-economic complexity differentgeographical scales.While literature environmental goods technologies mainlystudied homogeneous aggregated quantities , capacity EC methodologies tokeep away aggregation provide feasibility diagnostics level singleproducts technologies may prove extremely relevant analyzing potentialdirections green development country region . fact , environmentalgoods technologies highly heterogeneous terms functions ( Perruchaset al. , 2020 ) , across geographical areas stages life cycle environmentalgoods technologies ( Sbardella et al. , 2018a ; Barbieri et al. , 2022 ) , encompassmany different domains know-how ( Barbieri et al. , 2020 ) may linked innon-trivial ways pre-existing knowledge well productive specializationpatterns ( Barbieri et al. , 2020 , 2022 ; Montresor Quatraro , 2020 ) .Therefore , coupling geographical distribution productive technologicalcapabilities environmental socio-economic variables , various scholars haveapplied economic complexity toolbox try answer three main broad questions : • relationship complexity sustainability ? 1 https : //eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/ ? qid=1596443911913 & uri=CELEX % 3A52019DC0640 # document2Economic complexity sustainability transition 4• properties green products technologies , theseinherently different non-green ones ? • assess readiness national/regional knowledge bases andproductive structures green transition ? Contributions addressing first question investigate empirical relationshipbetween countries ’ environmental outputs , greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions , complexity productive structures , assessed focusing theexport dimension various EC metrics . However , studies far fromunanimous , vary samples estimating methods . yieldscontrasting results effect EC environment , ranging linearpositive non-linear relationships là Kuznets curve ( 1955 ) .The second third questions roots evolutionary economicgeography literature varied terms techniques scalesof observation . mainly examine geography green competitivenessof national/regional knowledge bases productive structures analysingspecialization profiles green products technologies . studies also lookat different dimensions relatedness green non-green technologicalor productive activities , inequality , political support environmental policy.As common EC literature , works especially stress potentialcomplementarity pre-existing capabilities future specialization low-carbon technologies products.The EC framework plays crucial role understanding sustainabilitytransition helping answer research questions .

PATSTAT published biannually EuropeanPatent Office ( EPO ) since 2007 grown substantially coverage time.As latest editions , records information 100 million patentapplications filed since late eighteenth century , collected 50million families . Whenever information available patent application , PATSTAT records , among things , receiving patent office , filing date ( i.e. , patent office received document ) , technologies thepatent innovates ( encoded standard technology codes ) , residence theapplicants inventors time filing . geographical informationis incomplete , coverage varying widely across patent offices . mostcommonly available information sense country residence inventorsand applicants . documents , granular data available ( e.g. , fulladdress ) , recorded structured format , makes challengingto process scale.REGPAT another popular resource patent data published annuallyby OECD . covers subset PATSTAT patent applications filed theEPO since inception 1978 . Since , geographical reasons , EPO attractsdisproportionately European patent applications , provide uniformgeographical coverage beyond European borders . Furthermore , filing costs theEPO higher national offices . skews sample towards “ high-value ” patents , indirectly , leads over-representation richer Europeancountries respect peripheral ones .

However , searching environment-related patent documents straightforward beginning adedicated classification system sustainable technologies available . fact , 2011 , specific branch IPC national/regional technologyclassification systems covered environment-related inventions.A first step direction creation 2011 Y02 class theEPO , cooperation United Nations Environmental Program ( UNEP ) International Centre Trade Sustainable Development ( ICTSD ) , tocomplement IPC European Classification System.6 beginning , purpose Y02 class tag CCMT patent documents means searchstrategies algorithms implemented expert examiners re-runperiodically update classes ( Veefkind et al. , 2012 , p.1 ) .

Since , CPC hasbecome increasingly popular classification standard complementingor substituting IPC growing number patent offices worldwide . Asillustrated table 1 , two types codes found CPC classification : codes starting letters H – similar IPC codes representing thetraditional classification technologies ; codes starting , used totag cross-sectional technologies “ fit single section IPC ” , although `` tagging codes section way replace classificationor indexing codes sections ” 7 . Therefore , classification scheme is6 European Classification System ( ECLA ) former patent classification system maintainedby European Patent Office ( EPO ) , replaced Cooperative PatentClassification ( CPC ) following introduction 2013.7 USPTO-CPC Section Y. https : //www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/cpc/html/cpc-Y.htmlEconomic complexity sustainability transition 13used tag patent documents already classified indexed somewhere else inthe classification . addition Y02 class , new subclass Y04S dedicated tosmart grids integrated CPC section . detail , shown Table2 , Y02 class consists 1000 tags related sustainable technologiesorganized 9 sub-classes.With aim maximizing informative content eco-innovation presentboth IPC CPC classifications , 2015 OECD ( Haščič Migotto,2015 ) developed Env-Tech , expert-based catalogue environment-relatedtechnologies based IPC classification lastly updated 2016 ( OECD,2016 ) , used tag green patent documents PATSTAT patentdata-sets . Env-Tech identifies 94 environment-related technology areas group4- 16-digit IPC CPC codes , building CPC Y02 class whenever possible.The catalogue relies keyword search strategy “ identifies relevant patentdocuments using alphanumeric symbols IPC CPC systems [ . . . ] whichcorrespond target environmental technology field ” ( Haščič Migotto , 2015 , p.19 ) meaningful policymakers . process selection carried withtest searches class individually , reviewing class description . itis possible identify single IPC/CPC classes portray alone technologicalfield interest , employs combination different patent classes . Env-Techprovides categorization green technologies cover exclusively CCMTsand encompasses also environmental management water-related adaptationtechnologies ( class 1 2 ) . mixing codes different aggregation levelsfrom CPC IPC classification ( still widely used many patentoffices around world ) .While widening object analysis undoubtedly commendable , unfortunately , makes catalogue vulnerable patent document re-classification . fact , additional information may useful forthe researchers working versions PATSTAT prior contemporaneous to2016 , year Env-Tech updated , using combination differentIPC CPC codes may constitute drawback working recentversions PATSTAT . classification codes comprisingany technology – especially finer-grained codes – changes time , possiblyreclassifying past inventions new codes . Furthermore , fixed time , Env-Tech suffers reclassification previous inventions , alsofails consider newer patent applications . Patent classifications slowlyEconomic complexity sustainability transition 14varying , like industry classifications sectors well defined changes inthe classification take place approximately every decade . Instead , technology codesare revised least year take account new technical advances , wellas improve search prior art patent officers use establish theapplication ’ degree innovation . instance , patent code becomes toopopulated retroactively split new codes . Let us consider fictitiouscase domain battery technologies , present several Env-Techsub-classes . Following new technical developments kind patent could splitinto several subcategories ( e.g . lithium nickel batteries ) new classes mightbe added batteries use new materials introduced ( e.g . graphite ) .If Env-Tech photographed moment time lithium nickelbatteries present classifications graphite batteries , would failto capture state art . Moreover , Y04S subclass covering smart grids , end 2016 comprised 54000 patent documents ( Angelucci et al. , 2018 ) , included Env-Tech catalogue . might lead underestimationof inventive efforts smart grids , despite fact Y04S codes heavilyoverlaps Y02 codes . contrast , Y02/Y04S codes part CPCsection therefore robust changes CPC classification , moreuser-friendly readily usable relevant data directly extracted byPATSTAT need intermediate steps . Lastly , another limitation Env-Tech , due limited granularity ( 94 categories disaggregatedlevel ) , allow detailed studies green technology development anddiffusion , obstacle carrying economic complexity analyses hingedon possibility developing algorithmic network tools able capture relevantparameters technological potential geographic areas fine-grainedlevels.2.1.2 . Trade data Since environmental goods services industry manual fordata collection analysis published OECD 1999 ( OECD , 1999 ) , awide array lists taxonomies green products proposed.Here briefly discuss lists commonly used inEconomic Complexity analyses , highlighting main critical issues classifyingenvironmental goods . Readers keep mind EC literature hasfocused , especially earlier works , establishing level complexityand growth potential economy extracting information tradeEconomic complexity sustainability transition 15specialization profile . order , harmonized global classification ofproducts uniform interpretation worldwide crucial developing theframework . Harmonised System ( HS ) classification satisfies requirementsand widely used field . standardized numericalmethod classifying traded products . used customs authorities identifyproducts , maintained World Customs Organization ( WCO ) whichupdates every five years . HS comprises 5,000 commodity subheadingswhich identified 6-digit code arranged according nested structuregoing 96 2-digit Chapters 1-digit 21 Sections.The first issue take account constructing comprehensive greenproduct classification nature HS classification system , whichwas conceptualized accommodating green/non-green dichotomy . Whilstmonitoring trade environmental goods central objective global policyagenda ( World Trade Organisation , 2001 ; Sauvage , 2014 ) introduction inthe Harmonized System several 6-digit subheadings including new environmentalgoods announced ( Steenblik , 2020 ) 2020 , currently , World CustomsOrganization slowly addressing issue updating HS system morecodes green products . However , updated classification yet available.Therefore , clear-cut identification environmental goods within existing productclassifications may times prove difficult task . instance , recently , impossible distinguish combustion engines electrical cars.Other classifications surveys exist , focused environmentalaspects products final use . Nevertheless , classifications notpresent standardization granularity properties required EC techniques.A second crucial point green classification unanimous definition ofgreen products . clearly depends specific needs address : forinstance , different requirements need satisfied order fulfil regulatory oracademic purposes define incentives tax reliefs aimed using renewableenergy sources , environmental practices buildings.While stressing series open questions , partially still unanswered , 1999report OECD ( OECD , 1999 ) environmental goods services industrywas defined `` activities produce goods services measure , prevent , limit , minimize correct environmental damage water , air soil , well asproblems related waste , noise eco-systems . includes cleaner technologies , products services reduce environmental risk minimize pollution andEconomic complexity sustainability transition 16resource use '' . report , list 121 environmental goods satisfying thisdefinition proposed . recently , according IMF:8 “ environmental goodsinclude goods connected environmental protection -— goods relatedto pollution management resource management -— adapted goods -— whichare goods specifically modified environmentally friendlyor cleaner ” . 2009 World Trade Organization ( WTO ) published list greenproducts ( Organisation , 2009 ) broader OECD list , comprising480 products . aim list agree upon wide classification forpolicy implications , evaluation , tariff regularization international trade . Whilethe list comprehensive , many inaccuracies biases pointed byEUROSTAT report published year ( EUROSTAT , 2009 ) . WTOalso published two shorter ’ friend ’ ’ core ’ lists composed respectively 154 26products . Similar efforts made 2010 OECD 2010 Toronto G20summit proposed updated list 150 Plurilateral Environmental Goods andServices ( PEGS ) . 2012 , Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) ( APEC,2012 ) put forward list 54 environmental goods subject reduced tariffs.Finally , 2014 , OECD published recent list green products , theCombined List Environmental Goods ( CLEG ) ( Sauvage , 2014 ) . CLEG comprises248 products identified combining revising APEC , WTO ’ friend ’ andthe PEGS lists , cover 150 products . However , CLEG focuses mainlyon goods relevance tackling climate change.Regardless specific definition , two main pitfalls shared greenproduct classifications : • Final use : many products , possible know actual final use.Many commodities labelled green ( e.g . filters , pumps pipes ) may usedalso non-environmental purposes . statistics computed basedon surveys , reliability global scale still unclear.• Greener products : depending goal study/application one couldconsider products less raw material intensive , longer life spans , energy efficient easier dispose . Clearly , properties8 definition environmental goods IMF Climate Change Indicator Dashboard , “ Trade Environmental Goods '' data-set found : https : //climatedata.imf.org/datasets/8636ce866c8a404b8d9baeaffa2c6cb3_0/explore , international trade flows inenvironmental goods – defined according OECD 1999 ’ list ( OECD , 1999 ) updated theIMF – reported.Economic complexity sustainability transition 17depend comparison products belonging category.However , comparisons , even principle , difficult carry out.From two issues , clear trade-off accuracy comprehensivenessarises . Moreover finally , list environmental products consideredfinal , HS classification , needs constant updates revision.2.2 . MethodsIn Economic Complexity framework , economic performance seen resultof accumulation non-tradeable inputs productive capabilities . EconomicComplexity seen indirect measure capability endowment acountry . notion capabilities developed firm level evolutionaryeconomics literature describe dynamic know-how allowing firms developand introduce new products services market ( Penrose , 1959 ; Teece et al.,1997 , 1994 ) . EC literature productive capabilities describe location-basedattributes , encompass intangible aspects contributing building andeffectively exploiting productive efficiency , institutional setups , educationsystems , policies , infrastructures needed country learn produceand export competitively complex products ( Hausmann Rodrik , 2003 ; Hausmann et al. , 2005 ; Sutton Trefler , 2016 ) . Information capabilities isgathered binary network based international trade data connectscountries product export comparative advantage.In following , present main metrics tools available theframework Economic Complexity.2.2.1 . Complexity measures basic intuition EC approach specificactivities , export production , labour sectors , patenting activity scientificresearch , important constitute different learning opportunities anddevelopment possibilities . EC explicitly builds heterogeneity interactionsbetween different economic actors , assuming level technological andscientific knowledge geographical area reached intensive level : knowledge grows accumulating ‘ ’ , adding new anddifferent elements existing capacities.In order , analyses Economic Complexity often start theobservation empirical bipartite networks connecting geographical areas – theyEconomic complexity sustainability transition 18countries , regions cities – different types economically relevant activities –such patenting ( Sbardella et al. , 2018a ) , goods production ( Tacchella et al. , 2012 ) scientific research ( Patelli et al. , 2023 ) – competitive . Thesebipartite networks typically assessed evaluating comparative advantage ofthe geographical area selected activity , using Balassa ’ Revealed ComparativeAdvantage ( RCA ) index ( Balassa , 1965 ) . index interpreted proxy forabove-average competitiveness given activity . RCA measures share ofproduction region activity compared reference distribution , typically theglobal share . formula , RCA geographic region g activity sector aon activity W , written follows : [ RCA ] ga =Wga ( ∑g′a′ Wg′a′ ) ( ∑a′ Wga′ ) ( ∑g′ Wg′a ) =Wga∑a′ Wga′/∑g′ Wg′a∑g′a′ Wg′a′ . ( 1 ) Despite simplicity RCA index competitiveness , criticism itreceived favor measures Absolute Advantage , RCA indexand refinements ( see Bruno et al. , 2023 ) remain workhorse binarizing theadjacency matrices bipartite networks EC literature.The RCA indicator assigns real positive value combination ofgeographical area activity . resulting distribution RCA values skewedwith large tails ( Patelli et al. , 2022 ) . Dealing continuous values largevariability impractical various applications often require theinformation competitive . Therefore , RCA matrix binarizedby setting threshold value , usually 1 . Therefore , RCA value 1 , isassumed region comparative advantage activity , value1 inserted matrix cell , zero otherwiseMga = { 1 [ RCA ] ga ≥ 10 otherwise ( 2 ) Geographical area g RCA 1 activity weight basket ofactivities g global weight activity relative activities.Though unit threshold clear focal value made standardin literature , different values might appropriate depending particularapplication.The first developed indicator addressing evaluation effective , orgeneral , diversification country Method Reflections ( Hidalgo andEconomic complexity sustainability transition 19Hausmann , 2009 ) , proposed iterative procedurek ( n ) g =1k0g∑a Mgak ( n−1 ) , k ( n ) =1k0a∑g Mgak ( n−1 ) g .

Hence , complexityis standardized ( i.e . removing mean dividing standard deviation ) .Since iterative model equation ( 3 ) trivial solution ( Caldarelli et al. , 2012 ; Kemp-Benedict , 2014 ) , authors aligned practical definition indexbased standardization eigenvalue associated second largesteigenvalue matrices derived Method Reflections . new indexis called Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) ( Hausmann et al. , 2011 , 2014 ) . Mealyet al . ( 2018 ) showed ECI equivalent approximated solution spectralclustering problem . Effectively , ECI divides countries two different groups withsimilar export baskets . However , ECI presents conceptual drawback due thefact complexities defined averages ( Pietronero et al. , 2017 ) . ECIdefines geographical complexity average product complexity geography ’ sbasket , product complexity average complexity geographical unitsspecialized product . averages create problem complexityincreases something higher average level complexity butdecreases something lower level complexity . absurd , therefore , could two countries , one produces everything one makesonly one product average complexity , complexity . thoughtexperiment shows looking averages ’ effective method youwant analyze cumulative quantities like capabilities.Furthermore , ECI based idea countries diversified.However , binary matrices diversification regionsrepresented rows . particular , matrices usually nested acrossdomains activity ( e.g . irrespective whether columns representEconomic complexity sustainability transition 20products , technologies scientific fields ) ( Patelli et al. , 2022 ) scales ofanalysis ( Pugliese et al. , 2019b ; Laudati et al. , 2023 ) concept nestednessoriginates ecology ( Atmar Patters , 1993 ) refers observation , response evolutionary pressure , species co-existing within ecosystem occupydifferent niches predictable manner whereby generalist species occupy mostor niches , progressively specialized species tend occupy subset ofthe niches . results ecosystems represented presence-absencematrix species niches ordered triangular arrangement inwhich ones cluster top left part zeros cluster bottom right.9Therefore , nestedness viewed footprint complex evolutionaryprocess , , , also framed evolutionary economics traditionthat room path-dependency complexity driving forces ofeconomic dynamic ( Dosi Nelson , 1994 ; Nelson Winter , 1982 ) . context , nestedness means less diversified regions typically comparative advantageover activities pursued diversified regions , resulting emergenceof hierarchical model represented triangular matrices ( Cristelli et al. , 2015 ) .It noted presence nestedness indication inthe presence correlated system easily described asimple linear model averages.A suitable model characterization nested patterns Fitnessand Complexity metrics ( Tacchella et al. , 2012 ) . Fitness region asum Complexities activities pursued , thus expanding activitybasket increases Fitness proportionally . extensive nature fitness iscomplemented definition Complexity driven mainly Fitnessof less competitive regions performing activity .

Indeed , itis possible overcome issue setting reference scale ( Mazzilli et al. , 2022 ) , i.e . assigning reference country fixed value , adding dummy countrythat always specialised activities.Another frequent issue appears Economic Complexity literature theanalysis systems across different geographical scales .

Relatedness Another set techniques Economic Complexitytoolbox aims estimating relatedness activities , e.g . pairsof products ( Hidalgo , 2009 ; Zaccaria et al. , 2014 ) , using product-level export datato measure relatedness statistically significant patterns co-exporting theinternational trade network . done relying assumption countriesthat able successfully export product developed set capabilitiesthat would enable diversify related goods . measure relatedness , proximity , two products based observation empiricalco-occurrences export basket different countries connected theprobability comparative advantage first product also leadto comparative advantage second . analytical tools tracedback Jaffe ( 1986 ) measure corporate coherence introduced Teeceand Pisano ( 1994 ) used also estimate relatedness technologiesBreschi et al .

However , presenta core-periphery structure , hubs leafs associated similar types ofactivities arranged meaningful communities.The first approach relatedness EC literature Product Space , developed Hidalgo et al . ( 2007 ) based exported products . similitudebetween products evaluated using proximity , measure normalized exportEconomic complexity sustainability transition 23co-occurrence pairs , mathematically defined ( Hidalgo , 2009 ) : ϕpp′ = min { ∑cMcpMc , p′∑c Mcp , ∑cMcpMcp′∑c Mcp′ } . ( 5 ) Originally , proximity interpreted `` conditional probability exportinggood product p given one exports good p ’ '' ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) 10 . thevisualization Product Space , network typically obtained pruning allthe links proximity certain value ( original work threshold was0.55 ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) ) . Intuitively , products share similar inputs besituated close network , filtered empiricalco-occurrences null model , proximity indicates relatively high probabilityof jumping product neighbouring one . Therefore , observation allowsus trace profitable trajectories enter new production line onthe basis pre-existing endowment productive capabilities.A statistically sound approach given evaluation thesimilarity pairs activities statistical validation assistmatrix ( Pugliese et al. , 2019a ; Sbardella et al. , 2022 ) . framework introducesthe idea studying co-occurrence within geographical area exportedproducts different points time . Indeed , possible country isable competitive given activity , available portfolio capabilities maybe important become competitive new activity time . assistmatrix estimates probability comparative advantage one activityin given year , conditional comparative advantage another activityin previous year ; typically lag 5 years considered . formula Assistmatrix isBαβaa′ ( y1 , y2 ) =∑gMαga ( y1 ) uαa ( y1 ) Mβga′ ( y2 ) dβg ( y2 ) , uαa =∑gMαga , dαg =∑aMαga .

Economic Complexity environmentEC indices widely used academics policymakers predict economicgrowth ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ; Tacchella et al. , 2012 ; Cristelli et al. , 2013 ; Tacchella et al. , 2018 ) . However , pursuit economic growth put underscrutiny academics society alike , due evidence associates economicgrowth – measured terms GDP – environmental degradation ( Raworth , 2017 ; IPCC , 2022 ) . Since measurement EC relies heavily nature theproducts exported countries regions , turn impact environmentwith different intensity ( embody different levels greenhouse gases , havedifferent energy requirements , produce less polluting byproducts ) , therehas growing interest understanding relationship complexityof countries ’ productive structures environmental degradation . ever-growingbody literature ( Table 3 ) investigated relationship , looking especially atthe export dimension complexity country-level measures environmentaldegradation.One strand literature assumes linear relationship EC andenvironmental impacts , producing mixed evidence . rather comprehensivestudy , Romero Gramkow ( 2021 ) analyse relationship 67 countries ’ complexity levels CO2 emissions , measured aggregate , per capita andproduct-specific emissions . latter proxied Product Emission IntensityIndex ( PEI ) , averages emissions countries exporting productwith comparative advantage – following methodology similar Hartmann et al.

However , period , higher complexity also associatedto worse air quality , measured terms exposure CO2 , PM2.5 , methane , andnitrous oxide.Neagu Teodoru ( 2019 ) examine heterogeneous effects EC ongreenhouse gases European countries . work shows higher EC ispositively liked growth emission greenhouse gases countries , althoughthis happens faster countries relatively lower levels economic complexity.These results consistent studies focusing exclusively mostcomplex countries : using time-series estimation techniques , Martins et al . ( 2021 ) find higher EC positively associated , unidirectional way , levels ofCO2 emissions top 7 countries EC ranking . Nevertheless , integration ininternational trade mitigated negative effects , allowing early industrializersto shift towards knowledge-intensive , less polluting tasks . Similarly , Rafique et al .

Given tight link betweenstructural transformation CO2 emissions , relevance complexitymetrics describe former process continuous diversification towardsmore sophisticated products , growing body literature attempted identifya complexity-based EKC . intuition behind reversed U-shaped relationshipbetween economic complexity CO2 emissions lies fact , countriesbecome ’ fitter ’ accumulate productive capabilities , shift specializationtowards knowledge-intensive goods , latter greener . Moreover , countries become technologically advanced , able improve theirenergy efficiency introduce green technologies process energy andmaterial production.An ECI-based EKC identified especially high-income countries , find mature post-industrial stage – , beyond peakof emissions coincided higher intensity employment manufacturingindustries . particular , ECI-based EKCs empirically tested France ( Gozgor , 2017 ) US ( Pata , 2021 ) , well sample of25 European countries ( Neagu , 2019 ) leading exporters ( Zheng et al.,2021 ) . However , said emerging economies , arestill intensive manufacturing extractive industries , associated tohigher environmental impact . instance , empirical tests EKC China– aggregate ( Yilanci Pata , 2020 ) regional level ( Akadiri et al.,2022 ) – find evidence reversed U-shaped relationship complexity andCO2 emissions . contrary , higher complexity appears associated withhigher environmental impact cases , despite negative association betweenregional complexity coal consumption China ( Dong et al. , 2020 ) . caseof Brazilian regions ( Swart Brinkmann , 2020 ) , EKC hypothesis validatedusing quadratic fit ECI several indicators environmental quality.The hypothesis holds waste generation , forest fires , deforestation andair pollution . However , higher regional complexity appears associated thecreation green occupations ( Dordmond et al. , 2021 ) .Economic complexity sustainability transition 28While could argued linear correlation EC andenvironmental degradation emerging countries – like China Brasil – couldbe led fact going phase industrialization , theirfuture ability decouple economic growth emissions yet proved . Thiscasts doubt whether expect low- middle-income countries godown path currently high-income countries . Even thecase , must taken account polluting industries countrieswere specialized may simply outsourced countries , lending supportto pollution hypothesis12 ( Cole , 2004 ) . Moreover , right part theEKC – decoupling economic growth CO2 emissions observed– populated developed countries ( Csereklyei et al. , 2016 ) .
