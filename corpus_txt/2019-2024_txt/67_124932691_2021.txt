Compared Heckscher–Ohlin model neoclassicalSustainability 2021 , 13 , 2049. https : //doi.org/10.3390/su13042049 https : //www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2021 , 13 , 2049 2 16economics ( including subsequent elaborated models build ) relieson country ’ factor endowment ( labor/capital ) predict competitive advantage ininternational trade [ 3 ] , ECI represents major step forward looking thequantity also diversity exports ubiquity exported products [ 1 ] .However , sense ECI related long-term economic growth , butalso inclusive sustainable change ? paper , hypothesize thisquestion answered extent better understanding internalcomplexity economy , capacity respond external shocks swiftshifts economy.2 . Literature ReviewA high degree internal complexity economy characterized large numberof specialized firms operate networks contain large amount knowledgeand knowhow [ 4 ] . persisted long time tandem larger economicecosystem containing complementary mix large , export-oriented firms resilientdomestic companies combined supportive not-for-profit organizations publicsector institutions , including responsive education research systems [ 5 ] . agile andinnovative companies within ecosystem mostly suppliers larger export-oriented firms observe trends abroad identify growing dependence particularimports viable counterparts domestic economy . seize opportunityby making use knowledge base , network , experience create domesticproduct matches quality price imported product graduallyimprove [ 6–8 ] . product may reach stage even becomes attractive tobe exported , due superiority quality , resource efficiency , positiveside effects society environment ( e.g. , produced less harmful substancesunder better working conditions ) [ 5 ] .The firms produce products may yet appear official export statisticsbecause still stage capturing opportunities domestic market first.However , increase long-term competitiveness country creating value-added products may meet growing demand abroad well justsuperior quality also terms sustainability . However , since operate abusiness environment characterized high content knowledge knowhow , human capital may become increasingly scarce expensive . result , new actorsin economic ecosystem emerge address scarcity developing technologies ( e.g. , robotics ) [ 9 ] services ( i.e. , job matchmaking services ) [ 10 ] help lower thesearch costs recruiting talent . allows generate higher returns theadoption creation innovation make high variable costs labor . Theyare also versatile sense need respond quickly new opportunitiesby customizing business . often leads innovation designed improve thesatisfaction customers , turns interest customers othermarket segments [ 5 ] .Another advantage domestic economy containing large network agile smallerfirms cater domestic well export-oriented industry resultingfavorable business environment creation new firms . , afavorable institutional environment good public education system help lowerthe costs business . Even crucial availability , timely delivery andquality existing goods services , well human capital ; produced primarilyfor domestic economy . new firm much likely succeed countrythat responsive domestic markets business services [ 5 ] .This favorable business environment non-tradeable nature reliesto great extent social capital provides glue enables firms well asnetworks firms hold continuously update knowledge knowhow [ 11 ] . Allthese aspects combined increase capacity replace economically relevant imports , toSustainability 2021 , 13 , 2049 3 16diversify exports , strengthen overall quality sustainability resultingvalue-added products.The idea measure internal complexity countries new . beencase studies extended concept economic complexity internal complexitywithin country ( see e.g. , [ 7,8 ] ) . results show using complexity frameworkwithin country gives important additional insight ability innovate ina particular domestic industry . Interesting findings study conducted Brummittet al . [ 12 ] show sustainable improvement economy , might moreadvisable reliable gradual increase technological complexity compared toa premature jump supported “ big push ” policies ; finding may play relevant rolefor emerging economies provide additional argument look importance ofthe internal complexity economy , order qualified view thefuture competitiveness resilience country.3 . Amalgamation Based Lie-Trotter Approach Capture Complexity aHolistic WayThe comparability countries based different internal data sources standardsin different countries remains challenging issue . makes holistic comparable com-plexity ranking , including internal complexity , difficult . However , due country ’ simport mix supplementary information export data , gain significant insightsabout country ’ economy . Namely , get know products required inproduction well consumption . obvious products importedmust produced internally . provides important additional insights country ’ sknowhow directly related internal economy . suggest closing gap byamalgamation based Lie-Trotter approach pre S-Level ( see e.g. , originalpaper Trotter [ 13 ] [ 14 ] ) global import information export information . Thismerging method offers possibility holistic complexity ranking accounts forthe internal complexity economy respect organic evolution thereof.4 . Main Argument HypothesisIn paper , argue ECI related long-term economic growth.However , also argue framework also potential capture sustainablechange resilience countries regard ability mitigate large shocks . Inthis context , propose novel method better understand internal complexityof economy capacity respond external shocks innovative shifts inthe economy may improve resilience lead products positive externaleffects society environment.To achieve , suggest amalgamation export import data pre S-Level . would improve understanding economic complexity systematicdriver sustainability . time , would allow incorporate internaleconomic complexity country comparative assessment respect organicevolutionary character economy.5 . Methodological ApproachIn order sure suggestion fits solid theoretical fundament , thebeginning understand mechanics ECI , based secondeigenvector e2 ( eigenvector associated second largest eigenvalue absolute value ) .For purpose , first established theoretical groundwork aim ensuretractability suggestion summarize follows : first embed ECIframework stochastic counterpart Section 7.1 . Afterwards , Section 7.2 , weinterpret ECI ranking statistical , probabilistic , information theoreticalpoint view . rigorous mathematical treatment mentioned interpretations , refer Lemmas 4.1 , 4.2 , 4.3 , 4.5 supplementary material . Knowing theShannon Entropy represents expected amount information transported identifyingthe outcome random trial one hand , exists certain relationshipsSustainability 2021 , 13 , 2049 4 16between Shannon Entropy Kolmogorov Complexity ( see comments end SectionS4 supplementary manuscript based Theorem 148 [ 15 ] ) hand , taken together finding relationship ECI Shannon Entropy , underlines notion complexity ECI ranking certain sense.Our main results summarized Section 8 , organized follows : Tounderstand ECI systematic driver sustainability ranking , first introducecoherency conditions summarize behavior ECI well alternative rankingswith respect coherency conditions standalone ( amalgamation ) well inamalgamated cases Section 8.1 . details mathematical treatment found inSection S5 supplementary materials . Roughly speaking , coherency conditions reflectthe expected properties complexity ranking systematic driver sustainability , additional quality check also related predictive power e2 . InSection S5 supplementary material , investigations mainly based theprototype information matrices . However , also introduce lemma , ensures thatif products countries well ordered respect inclusion relation , thene2 behaves coherently ( see Lemma 5.1 supplementary material ) .In Section 8.2 , introduce suggestion pre S-Level amalgamation first asa limited process , intuitively indicates organic merging methodologyfollowed simple formula computation . details mathematical treatmentsof Section 8.2 found Section S6 supplementary material . Section 9of paper , discuss main findings close relevant research gap . Namely , incorporation information internal complexity countries ECIframework means amalgamation import export information pre S-Level . fascinating area offers interesting research ideas , discussedin Section 10 , outlook . Section 11 provides concluding remarks , mainly relate toaspects like eligibility conditions tradeoffs , managed take intoaccount certain degree.6 . Empirical Validation Motivates Suggested ApproachIn section , discuss need merge supplementary information asimport data export information . Thereby , scrutinize key economic sustainabilityindicators selected countries demonstrate ECI ranking always reflectsthe underlying internal economic complexity country raises questions thenecessity enhancement.Inspired matrix operations governing dynamics commutative systems , used so-called Lie-Trotter product formula , think also appropriate fornon-commutative interacting systems organic evolutionary character . Accordingto analyses , amalgamated process seems “ favor ” balanced import ( complex-ity ) /export ( complexity ) ratio . Keeping mind , selected countries wethink low ECI ranking sustainability point view ECI isbased export data ; think enhancing ECI amalgamationof export import data might add additional insight improve quality ECIranking taking sustainability account.With aim account different degrees internal complexity , comparein section economies New Zealand Singapore , among others . NewZealand represents country makes use global knowledge economy developand eventually export value-added agricultural products low ECI ranking , Singapore global trading hub many different products services highECI ranking . means two countries , intend demonstrate apparentgap ECI ranking two countries could closed taking accountthe actual degree internal complexity means amalgamation export importdata.Tables 1 2 display key indicators selected countries one handvery high hand relatively low ECI rankings .

Thestrength Singapore probably related country ’ ability crate favorableeconomic framework conditions interconnectedness therefore different fromthe accumulated productive knowhow . fact , large network free trade agree-ments ( FTA ) gives Singapore widespread access international markets preferentialconditions . Although stage position question sustainabilityof Singapore , observe import content exports Singapore top 10according OECD data . indicates certain extent accumulated productiveknowhow Singapore different top five ECI countries . Therefore , caseof Singapore , rather argue amalgamation import data might slightly downgradethe ECI Singapore . However , FTAs additional supplementary information couldslightly upgrade merged . could rather lead different interpretation “ accumulated knowhow ” ECI.As summary observations , New Zeeland one hand Singaporeon hand , conclude amalgamation import information ECIframework good chance increase quality indicator measurement ofthe accumulated productive know . New Zealand supports hypotheses somecountries could upgraded ECI ranking taking imports account . course , updated ( export import data ) ECI ranking merged additionalnetwork information number FTAs complete measurement ofeconomic sustainability . would different message understand underthe current ECI ranking . sense , Singapore represent counterexample toour hypothesis.7 . Interpreting Building Blocks ECI Stochastic TermsOur main goal suggest model merge supplementary informationsources , develop organically .

Coherency e2 Sustainability Ranking AlternativesThe statistic , probabilistic , information theoretical properties e2 appealingand indicate similarities respect complexity except rare cases . However , properties answer relationship sustainability . coherency investiga-tion ( respect sustainability ) gives acceptable answer question . Namely , e2behaves logical ( minimal requirements ) accepts “ pathological ” cases . However , happens certain extent respect common sense sustainability conditions , fully satisfy following natural conditions terms sensitivities : ( 1 ) increase diversity specific country without expense ( e.g. , discovering side product without expense ) , less favorableranking comparing individually country . ( 2 ) Decrease ubiquity product country means waiving sameproduct another country , less favorable ranking.Of course , one disagree statements general condition due tospecial cases practice , even proven causal relationship justifies opposite.However , rather think justification kind causal relationship provingthe opposite conditions need additional information source metric basedon export data rather incapable delivering insight level.In context present paper , economic sustainability must related def-inition ability survive coexist unit ( countries , cities ) long run . Inother words , country ’ sustainability must understood ‘ future ability ’ ensured bya domestic economic ecosystem competitive classic sense price-competitiveness ability respond social environmental challengeswith scalable therefore commercially viable innovation . Therefore , believe sustain-ability management sense difficult risk management , justfocused preventing risks , also seizes opportunities.As good news , note case full comparability countries ( pairof two countries , one pair products country ) nosurprise : adequate choice sign e2 , given comparability product ranges , countries larger product range dominate ones smaller product range.We also investigated alternatives respect sustainability conditions . e.g. , diagonal weight matrix seems behave well also amalgamation doesnot induce surprises . Although seemingly natural , rigorous treatment finding istricky ( see Lemma 5.1 supplementary material ) .As summary , conclude e2 adequate complexity ranking instrumentexcept “ rare ” cases behaves amalgamation good amalga-mation .
