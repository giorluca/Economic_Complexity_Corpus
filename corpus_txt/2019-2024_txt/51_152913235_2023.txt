Introduction current landscape globalization shaped limited fiscal space , rising interest rates , pressing need financing , developed non-developed nations , particularly response urgent need ecological transition address climate change , fiscal considerations regained paramount importance . particular , exploration factors influencing country government ’ capacity secure funds international debt markets favorable terms garnered significant attention academic policy circles . study makes significant contribution respect . investigate role country ’ level economic complexity determinant sovereign credit risk , case developed countries , convenience yield . Economic complexity recently gained prominence new paradigm economic development . According Balland others ( 2022 ) various institutions , including World Bank , European Commission , World Economic Forum , OECD , numerous national regional organizations , increasingly adopted principles economic complexity incorporated analytical framework . concept revolves around nation ’ ability produce complex products easily substitutable global markets highly valued trade partners , specialized machinery , opposed basic commodities . follows , leveraging recent advancements causal machine learning , known double machine learning ( Chernozhukov others 2018 ) , assess impact economic complexity sovereign credit spreads ( respect US ) diverse panel 28 countries , encompassing emerging developed nations . Notably , analysis incorporates extensive array control variables , including relevant factors previously identified literature , comprising macroeconomic , market , debt-related institutional variables ( see section 2 motivation control variables ) . fact , first comprehensively consider range control variables examining direct impact economic complexity across various maturities yield spread curve , spanning 3 months 10 years . approach enables us effectively isolate influence multiple confounding factors estimating effects interest across countries maturities . sort analysis would unattainable 2 conventional panel econometrics factor models employed extant literature . primarily substantial number confounding variables , around 30 , require consideration estimating direct causal effects complexity spreads , given relatively limited dataset available countries time , especially low frequency variables ( annual ) . Crucially , approach openly acknowledges potential researcher-induced bias employing machine learning related techniques reduce dimensionality variables could impact sovereign debt . awareness crucial accurately estimating direct indirect causal effects . contrast , prior studies relied wide array variables investigate determinants sovereign debt , contributing significantly understanding field , exemplified Maltritz Molchanov ( 2013 ) employed Bayesian Moving Averaging , overlooked vital aspect essential extracting causal insights machine learning large-dimensional factor analysis . findings clearly highlight influence economic complexity sovereign credit risk , particularly longer maturities . According baseline calculations , increase one standard deviation economic complexity index ( ECI ) Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) leads approximate reduction 87 basis points ( bp ) 10-year spread ( p < 0.01 ) 54 bp 3-month spread ( p < 0.10 ) . highlights economic complexity impacts level spread , thereby affecting country ’ ability secure international funding lower cost also shapes slope yield spread curve , critical factor country ’ capacity mitigate rollover risks without incurring typically greater expenses funding longer maturity debt . second part results , evaluate relative importance economic complexity predictor sovereign risk spreads . analysis , employing different machine-learning algorithm known Extreme Gradient Boosting ( XGBoost ) , complements initial findings . demonstrate economic complexity , aside statistical economic significance determining sovereign risk , exhibits considerable predictive power . ranks third among 30 variables explaining sovereign spreads across short long maturities ( i.e. , 5 years 10 years ) . assessment relative performance achieved constructing Shap values XGBoost model . Interestingly , inflation institutional variables 3 appear exert stronger influence economic complexity , relevant traditional determinants literature real growth debt-to-GDP ratio . contribution extends two distinct branches existing literature . Firstly , align body research scrutinizes long-run factors influencing sovereign yields spreads ( e.g. , Bellas , Papaioannou , Petrova 2010 ; Poghosyan 2014 ; Wang , Xue , Zheng 2021 ) , introducing economic complexity crucial determinant . Secondly , contribute strand studies delve varied dynamics across different maturities yield spread curves ( Eichler Maltritz 2013 ) . studies underscore significance shifts curve slope dynamics changes debt maturity face different economic political shocks ( e.g. , Afonso Martins 2012 ; Wellmann Trück 2018 ; Augustin 2018 ; Sánchez , Sapriza , Yurdagul 2018 ) . remainder document structured follows : section two position study literature . section three revisit expected theoretical relationship economic complexity sovereign credit risk , particular focus recent literature stresses economic complexity significant determinant economic development fiscal performance . Section four provides overview methodology emphasis description credit risk spread measure taken Du Schreger ( 2016 ) , causal non-causal machine learning tools use answer research questions . Section five describes data sources . Section six presents main findings concluding section section seven . 2 . Related Literature contribute two distinct areas international finance . Firstly , study adds body research examines factors influencing sovereign risk measured sovereign yields . body literature emphasized importance fiscal discipline potential output growth reducing risk spreads , particularly longer terms . example , distinguishing long-term short-term determinants , Poghosyan ( 2014 ) found long run , 1-percentage point ( pp ) increase government debt-to-GDP ratio corresponds approximate 2 bp increase government bond yields1 . Additionally , 1-pp 1 See also Wang , Xue , Zheng ( 2021 ) recent assessment relationship debt growth . 4 increase potential growth rate associated approximate 45 bp increase yields . short term , sovereign bond yields may deviate temporarily long-term fundamental levels , approximately half deviations correct within year . Similarly , following distinction , Bellas , Papaioannou , Petrova ( 2010 ) proposed fundamental factors substantial influence shaping emerging market sovereign bond spreads long term , , conversely , short term , financial volatility emerges dominant determinant . add economic complexity set long-run factors previously investigated field . authors explored different set factors influencing sovereign yields , local foreign monetary policy conditions ( Arora Cerisola 2001 ; Dailami , Masson , Padou 2008 ) ; unconventional monetary policy interventions ( Krishnamurthy , Nagel , Vissing-Jorgensen 2018 ; De Santis 2020 ) zero lower bound interest rates ( Coroneo Pastorello 2020 ) . Local inflation rates deficit-to-GDP ratios ( Liu Spencer 2013 ; Gill 2018 ) also studied , well terms-of-trade volatility ( Hilscher Nosbusch 2010 ; Maltritz 2012 ) market uncertainty indicators , particular VIX ( Matsumura Machado 2010 ; Afonso Jalles 2019 ) . Since numerous studies pinpointed external factors main influencers sovereign risk , subset research delved impact financial trade openness sovereign spreads ( e.g . Maltritz 2012 ; Maltritz Molchanov 2014 ) . studies highlight convergence fiscal and/or political factors determining sovereign yields emerging advanced economies ( Sanjeev , Mati , Baldacci 2008 ; Caggiano Greco 2012 ; Afonso Jalles 2019 ; Beqiraj , Patella , Tancioni 2021 ) , including impact political factors ( Eichler 2014 ; Chatterjee Eyigungor 2019 ; Brooks , Cunha , Mosley 2022 ) . Additionally , extensive research demonstrating global factors influence sovereign credit risk commonality worldwide , particularly involving US stock bond market dynamics ( Longstaff others 2011 ; Liu Spencer 2013 ) , global financial risk ( Gilchrist others 2022 ) . prior studies provide rationale comprehensive set control variables use double machine learning conduct main analyses . study also aligns set research efforts investigate different maturities sovereign yields spreads respond economic shocks . Theoretically , long-term interest 5 rates closely intertwined market expectations concerning government ’ future solvency financing requirements , whereas short-term interest rates reflect concerns related liquidity short-term performance outlooks ( Freixas Rochet 2008 ; Eichler Maltritz 2013 ) . Consequently , reasonable anticipate determinants short- long-term yield spreads may different . composition long-term short-term debt plays fundamental role emerging market economies , highlighted Arellano Ramanarayanan ( 2012 ) . Long-term debt serves safeguard fluctuations interest-rate spreads , whereas short-term debt effectively incentivizes prompt repayment . related study , Sánchez , Sapriza , Yurdagul ( 2018 ) introduce framework endogenous determination sovereign debt maturity , highlights sovereign debt tends durations maturities commonly exceed one year tend move harmony economic cycle . Secondly , observes sovereign yield spread curves often exhibit non-linear , upward-sloping patterns . Finally , factors like output volatility , individual impatience , risk aversion , particularly abrupt cessation capital inflows , identified fundamental determinants debt maturity . Remarkably , Eichler Maltritz ( 2013 ) investigate factors influencing government bond yield spreads EMU countries . authors emphasize evaluation default risk across varying timeframes indicated spreads different maturities . findings indicate low economic growth greater economic openness amplify default risk across maturity levels . However , heightened indebtedness exclusively heightens short-term risk , factors like net lending , trade balance , interest rate costs predominantly impact long-term default risk . prior research second branch focused extracting common factors principal component analysis ( PCA ) yields ( spreads ) across broad set countries , aiming uncover global factors shape yield ( spread ) curves . studies typically identify three latent factors known level , slope , curvature , suffice describe time series variations interest rates across countries ( examples literature found recent works Afonso Martins 2012 ; Wellmann Trück 2018 ; Augustin 2018 ; references therein ) . approach different . Given economic complexity relatively slow-moving variable primarily associated long-term investments productivity knowledge diffusion ( Hidalgo 2021 ) , primary focus understanding 6 cross-sectional variations among countries economic complexity contribute explaining sovereign risk . emphasize high-frequency time series movements , often focus financially oriented research area . Nonetheless , examine different maturities ranging 3 months 10 years , results also provide insights line research highlighting anticipated relationship slope yield spread curve novel long-term determinant explore . 3 . Complexity sovereign yields , preliminary facts theory level economic complexity country assessed using economic complexity index constructed -and publicly available from- Harvard ’ Growth Lab ( Hausmann others 2014 ) , assigns numerical value within -3 3 , allowing quantitative assessment matter . short , ECI presents comprehensive approach simultaneously measuring economic development resilience shocks . surpasses broad indicators Human Development Index even GDP , tend focus specific aspects economy overlook relative position country global trade network . country complex produces goods relatively rare combine highly diversified set knowledge capabilities ( Hidalgo 2021 ) . Previous research established significant relationships country ’ ECI various economic social outcomes . Countries high ECI demonstrated ability effectively optimize production inputs enhanced output value ( Hidalgo 2021 ) , exhibit resilience face macroeconomic shocks ( Hausmann others 2014 ) , tend experience reduced income inequality ( Hartmann others 2017 ) , show positive association gender equality ( Nguyen 2021 ) . Additionally , societies characterized economic complexity inclined towards technological innovation ( Gala others 2018 ) , enjoy greater macroeconomic stability , particularly fiscal matters ( Gomez , Uribe , Valencia 2023 ) , tend adopt environmentally sustainable production practices ( Romero Gramkow 2021 ) . Given established relationships , reasonable expect negative association economic complexity sovereign risk . national level , high economic complexity consistently correlates long-term economic growth , evidenced numerous studies 7 ( e.g. , Hidalgo Haussmann 2009 ; Haussmann others 2014 ; Ferrarini Scaramozzino 2016 ; Tachella , Mazzilli , Pietronero 2018 ; Nepelski De Prato 2020 ) . economic literature , well established sophisticated exports linked higher future economic growth ( Hallak 2006 ; Hausmann , Hwang , Rodrik 2007 ) . Furthermore , countries boasting greater economic complexity tend exhibit stable growth patterns due reduced output volatility ( Gu ̈neri Yalta 2021 ) enhanced total factor productivity ( Sweet Eterovic 2019 ) . Economic complexity plays pivotal role achieving export stabilization , evidenced findings Zou others ( 2023 ) . research underscores significance product sophistication key factor initiating maintaining stable export partnerships . factors crucial drivers sustained economic expansion contribute fiscal budget stability , enabling nations navigate turbulent economic periods without succumbing fiscal crises , demonstrated Gomez , Uribe , Valencia ( 2023 ) . microeconomic level , compelling evidence suggesting companies complex product portfolio experience reduced fluctuations output ( Maggioni , Turco , Gallegati 2016 ) . Achieving productive diversification sophistication critical maintaining macroeconomic fiscal stability . Countries heavily reliant production basic ubiquitous goods vulnerable fluctuations international market prices , adversely impact overall income ( Deaton 1999 ) . Similarly , nations heavily dependent tourism susceptible global economic cycles , resulting sharp reduction tourism demand periods low global economic activity ( Aronica , Pizzuto , Sciortino 2021 ) . contrast , economies equipped capability produce complex goods complex networks involving various forms expertise capabilities tend exhibit greater resilience external shocks . Consequently , expected face lower risk experiencing fiscal crises enjoy lower credit risk prospect , priced market . Drawing parallel financial asset investments , diversified portfolio , especially consisting low risk assets , helps mitigate risk generate stable income investors time . Similarly , countries complex production structures benefit stable income streams , leading less fluctuation tax revenues governments . result , expected complexity associated lower costs sovereign debt reduced risk premiums . 8 Figure 1 shows ECI 60 countries year 2019 plotted sovereign yields 10-year bonds year . analysis excludes years 2020 2021 , ECI data readily available , due extraordinary disruptions caused Covid-19 pandemic , significantly influenced international debt market dynamics way orthogonal interests ( see , instance , Candelon Moura 2023 ) . evident figure , distinct negative correlation ( i.e . -0.65 , p < 0.001 ) ECI yields paid .

Correlation -0.65 . 4 . Methodology 4.1 . Sovereign credit risk Since primary concern country ’ sovereign credit risk , employ spread respect US given maturity year , rather raw yields Figures 1 2 . Specifically , utilize local currency sovereign risk indicators developed Du Schreger ( 2016 ) Du , Im , Schreger ( 2018 ) . indicators constructed deviations covered interest rate parity ( CIP ) government bond yields United States countries , denoted Φ𝑖 , 𝑛 , 𝑡 : Φ𝑖 , 𝑛 , 𝑡 = 𝑦𝑖 , 𝑛 , 𝑡𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑡 − 𝜌𝑖 , 𝑛 , 𝑡 − 𝑦𝑈𝑆𝐷 , 𝑛 , 𝑡𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑡 , ( 1 ) 10 , 𝑦𝑖 , 𝑛 , 𝑡𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑡 represents n-year local currency government bond yield country , 𝜌𝑖 , 𝑛 , 𝑡 represents n-year market-implied forward premium hedging currency US dollar , 𝑦𝑈𝑆𝐷 , 𝑛 , 𝑡𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑡 n-year US Treasury bond yield . Treasury CIP deviation measures distinction synthetic dollar borrowing cost country direct dollar borrowing cost United States . allows comparing sovereign borrowing costs converting promised cash flows local currency sovereign bonds US dollars . primary factors influencing CIP deviations government bond yields include differences default risk US foreign government bonds , variations convenience yields US foreign government bonds , financial frictions . relative significance factors depends specific country maturity studied ( Du Schreger 2016 ; Du , Im , Schreger 2018 ) . Du Schreger ( 2016 ) attribute spread variation credit risk , particularly case emerging markets . contrast , developed markets negligible sovereign default risk open capital accounts , Du , Im , Schreger ( 2018 ) attribute spread convenience yields stemming factors liquidity potential non-pecuniary benefits US bonds compared others . approach constructing spreads effectively mitigates currency risk factors reflected traditional spreads , enabling us concentrate analysis sovereign credit risk . second step undertake pertains challenge identifying direct causal effects amid presence numerous potential confounding factors within dataset typically contains relatively data points ( compared typical machine learning tasks ) . Building prior research , aware various macroeconomic factors , spanning supply demand sides economy , play significant roles . factors include real growth , investment consumption growth , institutional variables rule law regulatory quality , global uncertainty , levels capital account openness , terms trade , export commodity rents , population size , debt-related metrics like debt-to-GDP ratio , fiscal balances , primary balances , government revenue . factors expected exert influence spread sovereign bonds . However , data spreads available original authors ’ website typically commences mid-2000s emerging market countries . primarily due limitations 11 original data sources , Bloomberg . certain cases , like Chile , three years enough observations ( 2005 , 2011 , 2017 ) 1995 2019 information economic complexity index available ( excluding period Covid-19 pandemic ) . Given combination relatively limited data points , low frequency economic complexity measurements ( annual ) , substantial number potential confounding variables , becomes essential employ non-traditional machine learning models recently developed econometrics literature specifically address causal inquiries presence numerous confounding variables . 4.2 .
