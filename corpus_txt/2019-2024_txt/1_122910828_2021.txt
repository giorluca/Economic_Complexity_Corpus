Abstract Complexity complexity economics relatively new fields science , started beginning 1980s . emerged , questions raised regarding complexity ’ applicability human-involved systems predictive powers . Economics spotlight recent years within framework complexity , since economics one well-established fields social sciences . early years , research complexity economics , commonly referred , distanced reductionist neoclassic tradition economics identified use , reliance , descriptive equations . One salient features complexity economics somewhat unorthodox approach economic systems , emphasis non-equilibria . However , recent years , proponents become assertive complexity economics needs modest symbiotically co-exist well-established mainstream economics . Although focus economics prism complexity , underlying interest extensible , ask disciplines , industrial engineering operations research , may benefit similar complexity-oriented perspective . Keywords : Complexity , Complexity economics , Mainstream economics , Equation-based economics , Non-equilibrium 1 . Introduction may said Complexity Economics still embryonic developmental stages . far , universally agreed upon consensus . Neither complexity general well-accepted definition . Moreover , applicability real world problems also similarly debated . One might say due interdisciplinary nature field . , requires scholars fully grasp core ideas outside respected fields expertise . emerging field , still much discovered . reported ( see [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) , topic lacks “ meta-theoretical foundation ” . deduce complexity economics science establishment growth , phase pre-science . , much debate philosophical nature , economists complexity scientists seek common ground methodological framework . term “ Complexity Economics ” coined Brian W. Arthur , Santa Fe Institute ( SFI ) , led Economics Program SFI late 1980s . general sense , complexity economics aims solve problems consisting complex systems economics within framework complexity science . Farmer [ 3 ] differentiates complexity economics comparing mainstream economics econometrics . urges economists take complexity-economics approach problems economy : “ complex systems approach intermediate traditional economic theory HSD Vol . 3 , . 1 , March 2021 , pp.34- 43 35 econometrics . Traditional economic theory top-down , modeling decision making first principles , testing data later . “ first principles ” mean requirement theories “ economic content ” , i.e. , derive behaviors preferences . Econometrics , contrast , takes bottom , data-driven , fundamentally ad hoc approach . complex systems approach sits middle , taking bottom-up data-driven approach differs traditional econometrics explicitly representing agents institutions modeling interactions , without requirement everything derived fundamental principles ” [ 3 ] . Complexity economics ’ point view regards constituents economics constantly evolving non-equilibrium structures [ 4 ] . However , mean equilibrium significant economics , since “ [ ] useful situations economics well-defined , rationalizable , reasonably static ” [ 4 ] . Arthur [ 4 ] also argues new approach stems change science advancement computers computation . states “ science mathematics shedding certainties embracing openness procedural thinking , reason expect economics differ regard ” . approach mathematics science complexity distance traditional Newtonian mechanics solves problems algorithms algorithmic thinking [ 4 ] . Algorithmic thinking brings convenience research , due flexibility similarity human language [ 1 , p. 398 ] . also much criticism skepticism towards complexity science complexity economics . comes Ref . [ 5 ] , whose arguments provide general overview criticism field . critics reprehend complexity science attempt solve everything , albeit framework still vague . Although , complexity economics started ambitiously 1980s , beginning 2000s , researchers complexity economics distanced field orthodox economics ( also called traditional economics mainstream economics ) . However , field gained popularity , still lacking meta-theory complete framework , become closer genial mainstream economics , without losing ambition novel understanding . last two decades , started assert mainstream economics , specifically neoclassical tradition , already well-established school economics researchers complexity economics needs benefit . paper aims explain complexity economics providing fundamental intrinsic features complexity associated economics interested field complexity economics . literature emerged since beginning complexity economics 2010s seems rather strongly opinionated , reviewed Sections 3 4 . emerging applied field often serves example complexity may incorporated well-established scientific domains , complexity economics attracts economists complexity scientists , much wider audience . However , seems lack papers provide central ideas complexity economics . review related comments presented article ; aim provide remedy shortfall . , review beneficial complexity scientists economists , also academicians applied natural sciences well general public . next section Complexity Complex Systems , explain complexity science , also highlights features complexity economics . section , Complexity Economics : Santa Fe Institute , Started provides historical overview Santa Fe Institute complexity economics started . section sheds light complexity economics evolved throughout years . Later , section Complexity Economics : Current Debates , present main discussions regarding complexity economics . conclude paper specific remarks . 2 . Complexity complex systems Complexity science relatively new scientific world . Accordingly , general field well one specialization areas , namely complexity economics , lacks well-accepted standard definition . Although HSD Vol . 3 , . 1 , March 2021 , pp.34- 43 36 foundation general systems stretches back 1940s , even earlier work Bogdanov ’ tektology 1922 , notion “ complexity science ” coined 1980s [ 6 ] . Complexity deals area called meso-layer . property stems definition American mathematician scientist Weaver [ 7 ] , partitions scientific problems three categories : problems simplicity , problems disorganized complexity , problems organized complexity . Problems organized complexity domain complexity science , hence complexity economics . problems meso-layer , problems disorganized complexity Weaver calls , consists variables dealt like case-study problems problems simplicity , averageable problems disorganized complexity . example , motion two objects falls problems simplicity ( described variables ) , motion gas atoms room ( billions variables ) falls problems disorganized complexity . latter , behavior one single variable predictable . However , behavior whole system predictable use statics statistical mechanics . focus study , problems organized complexity , statistical methods fall short explaining behavior complex system . due properties emergence complex systems possess . mentioned , term “ complexity ” still well defined [ 8 ] . due fact covers vast number research domains economics , sociology , political science , biology , etc . Nonetheless , Mitchell [ 8 ] proposes definition : “ complex system [ ] system large networks components central control simple rules operation give rise complex collective behavior , sophisticated information processing , adaptation via learning evolution. ” [ 8 ] . proposing definition built common properties complex systems , suggests : ( ) individuals ( parts ) complex systems behave collectively . possible understand behavior systems observing one two individuals . Without leader consciousness , individuals work coherence form trends behavior whole . agent ( individual , institution , banks , government , etc . ) follows simple rule , collective behavior , patterns behavior hard predict . American economist Thomas Schelling refers “ micromotives , macrobehavior ” meaning micromotives agents give rise macrobehavior society [ 9 ] . ( b ) Complex systems use information signals internal external environments . also known “ whole greater sum parts ” – phrase coined Aristotle . phrase also suggests understand whole , analyzing understanding behavior agents system sufficient . Also , relations agents crucial due interdependence agents [ 10 ] . ( c ) Complex systems adapt . behavior agents iterates , reform strategies behavior , learn evolve . notion sometimes called emergence . Grabner [ 1 ] also adds parts complex systems heterogeneous emergence “ may feed back parts lower ontological levels ” . Arthur [ 11 ] states similar properties complex systems , also argues “ complex systems systems process , systems constantly evolve unfold time ” . Nonlinearity complex systems , well complexity economics , another common property scholars name [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . Parallel view Fontana [ 15 ] affirms complex systems nonlinear , nonlinear systems complex . Castellani [ 16 ] maps fields relevant complexity science shows roots complexity science based dynamical systems , systems theory , complex systems theory , cybernetics , cognitive science . application commonly accepted fields biology , medicine , chemistry . terms social sciences , sphere still yet solidify . next section , provide summary Santa Fe Institute Economics Program considered Complexity Economics start . historical approach gives perspective foundations complexity economics , field evolved years . HSD Vol . 3 , . 1 , March 2021 , pp.34- 43 37 3 . Complexity Economics : Santa Fe Institute , started history complexity economics SFI elaborately explained Fontana , interviews SFI researchers [ 15 ] . SFI founded 1983 physicist George Cowan , worked Manhattan project . aim start research institute researchers various fields collaborate interdisciplinary , “ blue-sky ” research connect “ soft sciences ” “ hard sciences ” . noted times systems studies popular , especially Kuhn ’ Structure Scientific Revolutions [ 17 ] , Club Rome work “ Limits Growth ” [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . Kuhn makes distinction “ ordinary ” “ extraordinary ” science argues ordinary science certain field inevitably faces crisis due inadequacy paradigm . crisis forces scientists come new paradigm . effort establishing new paradigm referred extraordinary science , , new paradigm becomes dominant paradigm used subsequent scientific work . switch , subsequent scientific work , follows new paradigm , considered ordinary science . switch referred “ paradigm shift ” . Club Rome work “ Limits Growth ” written general public , considers five factors world ( population , nonrenewable resources , industrial output , pollution , agricultural production ) forecasts world live beyond 2100 . study based “ Systems Dynamics ” , tool based feedback loops developed 1950 ’ J. Forrester , professor MIT Business School electrical engineering background [ 20 ] . study well received academia community , forecasts still seem hold today [ 19 ] . Given , Cowan ’ initiative might akin certain trend science consequence crisis soft hard sciences , prompting search new paradigm . respect , economics taken starting point . Economics good choice since , among social sciences , prevalent applied science . Three workshops organized throughout years , 1987 , 1996 , 2001 . Fontana describes workshops weakly heterodox , strongly heterodox , synthesis , respectively . workshop , participants published discussions , findings book series Economy Evolving Complex System . 1987 , ten physicists led Nobel Laureate Philip Anderson , ten economists led another Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow met first ten-day workshop . noted Anderson known anti-reductionist views , Arrow reductionist neoclassical approach . Fontana also defines neoclassical economics “ economic thought relies market equilibrium organizing concept ” [ 15 , p.168 ] . acknowledges change neoclassical economics throughout years , states SFI used initially , also underlines core “ orthodox economic thinking ” . Arrow commented effort considered fully new approach , part general economics [ 21 , p.280 ] . scholars [ 11 ] , [ 22 ] opposing views , workshop ended drifting apart neoclassic tradition [ 15 , p.170 ] . year later , SFI started Economic Program chair economist Brian Arthur , also participated first workshop . economist workshop known heterodox approach economics . contribution Brian Arthur John Holland , complexity economics took another path deviates traditional economics . Arthur stresses stochastic dynamics , increasing returns well relevant notions path dependence ( non-ergodicity ) lock-in , due fact : “ …complex systems systems multiple elements adapting reacting [ aggregate ] pattern . time via adjustment change , elements react , aggregate changes ; aggregate changes , elements change anew ” [ 11 , p.2 ] . Regarding conventional ( traditional ) economics , also adds : “ Conventional economic theory chooses study unfolding patterns agents create , rather simplify questions order seek analytical solutions ” [ 23 ] . Thus , differentiates complexity economics traditional economics stating : HSD Vol . 3 , . 1 , March 2021 , pp.34- 43 38 “ Conventional economics studies consistent patterns behavioral equilibrium , patterns would induce reaction [ whereas complexity economics seeks understand ] actions , strategies , expectations might react general -might endogenously change with- aggregate patterns create ” [ 24 ] . position director Economics Program , Arthur SFI researchers developed popularized agent-based simulation used complexity economics . Arthur introduced El-Farol Bar problem argued agents ’ self-referential decision-making process based induction rather deduction . Thus , insisted “ plurality views cognitive foundation economics , opposition mainstream ’ monofoundation deductive optimizing rationality. ” [ 15 , p.178 ] . John Holland , hand , brings attention algorithm-based computer simulations instead equation-based mathematics [ 25 ] . calls complex systems adaptive nonlinear networks ( ANNs ) proposes detailed properties ANNs , “ dispersed interaction , global controller , hierarchical organization , continuous adaptation , perpetual novelty , non-equilibrium dynamics ” . subject relatively extensive substantial work [ 15 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 25 ] . view , Holland suggests ANNs assume perfect knowledge rationality . ANNs also enable heterogeneity agents . proposes Genetic Algorithms ( GA ) economics models suggests GA incorporates properties ANNs [ 15 , p.175 ] . second workshop 1996 shows much complexity economics drifted apart mainstream economics . Fontana refers period “ strongly heterodox ” . , Santa Fe Perspective become centric Holland ’ definition 1988 . ANNs started referred “ complex adaptive systems ” . workshop stood two objectives : cognitive structural foundations , SFI advocated pluralistic view rather one unified cognitive foundation reasoning , due adaptation interpretation properties agents . workshop gained lot popularity science world , researchers worked institute led complexity economics closer mainstream economics . directorship Samuel Bowles 2000-2003 , workshop 2001 implied merge Santa Fe Perspective mainstream economics ( directors SFI Economics Program , themes throughout years provided Fontana [ 15 ] ) . 4 . Complexity Economics : Current debates One central debates whether complexity economics subsumes economics , vice versa . Fontana [ 26 ] argues , terms Kuhn ’ idea scientific revolutions , complexity economics new paradigm mainstream economics debates ontologically complexity economics view incorporated economics . Many others ( [ 4 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] ) , especially SFI accord view . Arthur adds : “ shift - seeing economy evolving , complex system - three implications : 1 . included heterogeneous agents ( differing consumers , banks , firms ) together creating patterns reacted , models could easily `` solved '' analytically . natural approach agent-based modeling . 2 . agents models attempted formulate decisions problem agents ( differed unknown ways ) trying , ill-defined decision problems resulted . Decision making context could best seen inductive , deductive . Hence , focused greatly issues cognition economy , making heavy use initially John Holland 's ideas . 3 . agents reacted patterns , co-created , definition problems investigated started equilibrium ( i.e . static solution point ) . appropriate research question problem patterns outcomes would arise ? Would system find way conventional equilibrium ? would find ever-new patterns , produce perpetual novelty ? ” [ 30 ] . HSD Vol . 3 , . 1 , March 2021 , pp.34- 43 39 Among SFI scholars , variants complexity economics approach revolve around Arthur ’ ideas . Tuxford [ 14 , p.252 ] , recognizes generative economics [ 31 ] ; interactive-agent economics [ 32 ] ; agent-based computational economics [ 33 ] ; complex economics [ 34 ] . Arthur [ 37 ] calls scholars “ optimists ” . Tuxford summarizes optimists ’ main objection mainstream economics : “ ... theorists arguing , rejection mainstream methodological practice favor one essentially based mechanisms ; rejection descriptivist instrumentalist practice focused prediction , favor realist alternative targeted successful explanation. ” [ 14 , p. 251 ] . Figure 1 . Beinhocker 's Imagined Economic Order [ 36 ] Moreover , talk SFI 2019 Fall Symposium , American economists SFI Researcher , Beinhocker states economy human created imagined order visualizes Russian matryoshka dolls ( Figure 1 ) [ 36 ] . argues today ’ economic system based homo economicus , referring assumption human beings selfish pursue pleasures , words , aim maximize utilities . adds theory proven true part “ armchair economy ” – term coined Herbert Simon indicate 18-19th century economists came theories without scientific support , sitting armchairs . Beinhocker explains today ’ science supports idea “ real human decision-making inductive heuristic , modular , emotionally intelligent , highly social. ” [ 36 ] . concludes speech suggesting new economic order ( Figure 2 ) based upon current scientific ideas . Figure 2 . Beinhocker 's Suggested Economic Order [ 36 ] SFI ’ perspective optimist one ; however spectrum course , scholars “ less optimists ” . mentioned previous section , SFI become genial recent years towards orthodox economics . According latest workshop held 2019 , consensus complexity economics vital solving current future problems relevant economy , economists need leave traditional approaches [ 37 ] . However , “ less optimist ” SFI researcher Scott Page debates equilibrium-based neoclassical economics non-equilibrium-based complexity economics needs studied complementary manner , rather competing dominant framework [ 38 ] . Grabner et al , [ 39 ] also provide preliminary study show equilibrium-based models agent-based simulation ( nonequlibrium-based model ) approaches together give rise insightful results . work tests claims Kuznets hypothesis ( long-run relationship economic development unemployment ) . HSD Vol . 3 , . 1 , March 2021 , pp.34- 43 40 side spectrum , “ modest ” scholars Schasfoort ’ expression . Modests oppose optimists , arguing mainstream economics subsumes complexity , complexity economics complementary mainstream economics [ 40 ] . term “ modesty ” used Hoogduin speech OECD 2016 . speech , Hoogduin stated economists “ modest ” terms achieve economy , accept future predicted [ 41 , p.11 ] . affirms neo-Austrian especially Hayek tradition along cognitive sciences solid foundation complexity economics . Hoogduin ’ view aligned Montgomery [ 42 ] compares complexity economics Hayek tradition . Concurrent modest perspective , scholars suggest institutional economics complexity economics complement [ 1 ] , [ 43 ] . work , Grabner argues institutional economics provides meta-theoretical foundation complexity economics lack , complexity economics provide methods ( agent-based simulation ) institutional economics . also adds institutionalists Veblen Myrdal already studied economics complex system without specifically used word “ complexity ” [ 1 ] . Another point adds complexity economics studied , focus mechanisms deep explanations . mechanism definition , based Bunge ’ definition [ 44 ] , “ … process sequence states concrete system ” [ 1 , p.398 ] . Deep explanations opposing view Occam ’ razor , states two theories explain phenomena , simplest one preferred . Grabner debates simplest theory , deeper theory explains underlying mechanisms phenomenon selected . Tuxford PhD thesis debates institutionalist methodology mechanistic suggests neo-mechanistic framework complexity economics [ 14 ] . Using neo-machanistic complexity economics framework , shows asset pricing phenomena explained , whereas orthodox economics fails . Schasfoort [ 35 ] also reports current debates field . addition debates orthodox-heterodox economics , optimist-modest economists , also adds debate complex model among complexity economists use formal mathematical models ; lack model description protocol agent-based simulation ; validate agent-based simulation . However , rather discussions due fact complexity economics still unsettled field . still demarcate complexity economics per se , unusual application methods still debated . 5 . Conclusion future study document summarizes work done date complexity economics . topic general domain complexity theory emerging field complexity economics . Concurrent discussions given previous section , future studies aim investigate whether complexity economics mainstream economics co-exist might yield broader understanding . specifically , non-equilibria one salient features complexity economics . However , mainstream economics seen equation-based , already well established , consistently yields useful insights . , better use equation-based approach better consider non-equilibria ? possible build framework complexity economics making use equation-based neoclassical approach ? topic provide specific starting point , also enjoys extensive body literature field . Future work necessary fully establish whether complexity economics subsumes economics vice versa , perhaps something else . complexity economics becoming trendsetter , larger question regarding whether disciplines traditionally rely concepts optima , equilibria , descriptive equations may also benefit parallel studies similar complexity perspective . Would complexity framework useful applied fields artificial intelligence , service systems , Industrie 4.0 , sustainability , production systems ? engineering systems , reach certain extend activity , best viewed complex HSD Vol . 3 , . 1 , March 2021 , pp.34- 43 41 systems ? kind contributions might complexity framework bring current understanding engineering know-how ? fundamental future questions formulation whose answers may benefit brief review complexity economics .
