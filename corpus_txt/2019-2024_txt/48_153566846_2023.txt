Understanding substantial differences economic growth among different countries , great guiding significance promote national growth . Half century ago , scholars usually used Purchasing Power Parity ( PPP ) Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) measure economic development status country , statistics calculation two indicators require consuming abundant resources time cost actually , neither could reflect real valid national economic development promptly ( Liu , 2016 ) . Balassa proposed index Revealed Comparative Advantage ( RCA ) measure relative advantage country ’ exports certain product global average export level product , reflection country ’ competitiveness product ( Balassa , 1965 ) . Hausmann et al . proposed Product Space theory evolution comparative advantage based Romer ’ endogenous growth theory 2006 2007 , respectively , argued products reflect country ’ productive capacity , degree similarity products determines easily country “ leap ” one product another new product . , product core product similarity network , easy upgrade transform another product . means countries products likely transform upgrade industrial structure . addition , , diversity national export products ubiquity products reflect country ’ industrial competitiveness different aspects ( Hausmann , 2006 , 2007 ) . study economic complexity began 1960s , far-reaching influence significance in-depth analysis law economic system development . Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) , proposed Hidalgo Hausmann 2009 , new indicator measure economic strength productive capacity country using network science . Specifically , method reflections , based RCA index country ’ exported products , used measure economic complexity using combination two indicators : diversity index ubiquity index country ’ products exported ( Hidalgo , 2009 ) . Tacchella et al . found measurement ECI based method reflections take account situation “ country exports products , high-end products ” , developed nonlinear fitness-complexity method , made shortcomings method reflections deviated essence economic complexity theory ( Tacchella , 2013 ) . Later , Sciarra et al . proposed Generalised Economic Complexity Index ( GECI ) combining advantages first two methods reconciling method reflections nonlinear fitness-complexity method reflect economic structure country comprehensively , high interpretability better reflect economic strength country , raised widespread attention recognition scholars ( Sciarra , 2020 ) . www.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/jepf Journal Economics Public Finance Vol . 9 , . 4 , 2023 50 Published SCHOLINK INC . lot documents based method reflections nonlinear fitness-complexity method study nexus economic complexity economic growth performance , important results achieved . Hidalgo Hausmann Simoes generally concluded economic complexity significant persistent positive impact growth economic levels ( Hidalgo , 2009 , 2021 ) . Ferrarini Scaramozzino found complexity productive capacity potential impact national income ( Ferrarini , 2016 ) . Hartmann et al . studied 150 countries period 1963-2008 discovered countries high economic complexity less likely experience income inequality ( Hartmann , 2016 ) . Gao Zhou analyzed data 31 Chinese provinces period 1990-2015 concluded significant negative correlation economic complexity relative income differences ( Gao , 2017 ) . Sweet Eterovic studied sample 70 countries around world period 1965-2009 found significant positive impact economic complexity productivity country ( Sweet 2018 ) . Lee conducted study economic complexity national income levels using cross-country panel data results reconfirmed findings Hartmann , suggest higher economic complexity helps improve national income inequality education levels , government spending trade openness reach certain thresholds ( Lee , 2020 ) . Sephrdoust stated rapid development Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) inflows , free trade , capital investments increased economic complexity developing countries Middle East , turn led rapid increase level national economies ( Sephrdoust , 2019 ) . existing studies economic complexity based method reflections fitness-complexity method analyze world trade network , individual-level complexity analysis countries industries , China ( Gao , 2018 ) , United States United Kingdom ( Mealy , 2019 ) , Mexico ( Chvez , 2017 ) , Italy ( Basile , 2019 ) . Moreover , studies mainly focus study export complexity index developed countries industries , studies examine relationship economic complexity country industrial competitiveness using GECI . Accordingly , study object paper 36 Asian countries . Using combination network science statistical analysis method , empirically analyze correlation economic complexity industrial competitiveness Asian countries . Firstly , establish country product bipartite network based global economic trade data , calculate diversity index national products exported based RCA index , measure GECI countries rankings , analyze evolutionary characteristics , combine GECI countries complexity outlook index reveal characteristics development trend international competitiveness Asian countries ’ industries . structure paper follows .

( 3 ) correlation analysis GECI country ’ level economic development reveals GECI positively correlated economic growth , promote economic growth technological innovation industrial upgrading . ( 4 ) analysis COI country , found China , Turkey India significantly stronger industrial upgrading potential , countries Qatar Kuwait weaker industrial upgrading potential . worth nothing GECI fully represent degree economic development country . example , 2019 , GECI South Korea Singapore lower China , mean economic growth South Korea Singapore lags behind China . reason deviation GECI mainly based dual information country products exported comparative advantage , constitution economic strength includes : investment , consumption , export . calculation GECI considers information export products , completely truly reflect overall production structure economic strength country . Besides , measurement data GECI include trade data service industry , may underestimate degree economic development counties relatively heavy service industry . example , Singapore ’ GDP service industry 2019 accounts 75.3 percent GDP , economic development may underestimated . Despite limitations , GECI based perspective network science describe economic structure country integrally , remains important indicator national economic strength . Compared traditional economic indicators per capita GDP CPI , roughly show overall economic development level country , GECI specifically reveal main economic structure country international perspective . addition country ’ economic strength international competitiveness terms export trade , explore country ’ industrial upgrading potential development direction . Therefore , GECI given close attention various national economic strategy decision makers , results study may provide decision-making basis valuable resources transnational trade investors policy makers .
