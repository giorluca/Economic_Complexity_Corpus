McKinsey Global Institute recent report1 stated theincreasing adoption automation technologies , including artificial intelligence robotics , generate significant benefits economy , raising productivity economic growth , far-reaching impact global workforce . particular , according thestudy , around half current work activities subject technically automatable byadapting current available technologies , 2030 , 75 million 375 million workers willbe displaced automation need change occupation avoid unemployment.Brian Arthur , one pioneers studying economics digital age , recentlystated2 reached close above-mentioned “ Keynes point ” , i.e . neweconomic era witnessing “ third morphing ” digital revolution . Inparticular , first morphing 70s/80s characterized microchip theavailability cheap digital calculus , second morphing 90s/00s widespreaddiffusion computer networks , third morphing bringing intelligent machines . Thecombination computers , sensors , big data statistical learning techniques , providesmachines characterized sort associative intelligence typical biological beings , potentially able substitute humans large set activities.1McKinsey Global Institute , Jobs Lost , Jobs Gained : Workforce Transitions Time Automation , December 2017.2Arthur ( 2017 ) technology taking economy . McKinsey Quarterly1.1 Digital intangible assets : literature review 2In respect , higher efficiency related introduction new digital technologiesgenerally determines higher productivity turn lead lower employment , seePianta ( 2009 ) . Furthermore , worth noting innovations introduced inthe production process end XX century empowered workers additionalmechanical energy able overcome limits imposed human physical force , “ Sec-ond Machine Age '' ( Brynjolfsson McAfee ( 2014 ) ) characterized robotics , automation , software artificial intelligence ( AI ) might able surmount also limits imposed byhuman mind . Technological unemployment becoming concern “ bluecollars '' also “ white collars '' workers . However , empirical studies shown jobpolarization completely consistent so-called “ skill-biased technical change '' , seeAutor Dorn ( 2013 ) ; Goos Manning ( 2007 ) ; Goos et al . ( 2014 ) . Indeed , advent ofnew digital technologies led decreasing demand mid-range workers performingroutine manual cognitive tasks , time , increasing demand highsalary non-routine cognitive jobs low salary non-routine manual jobs.The key element intelligent machines software , i.e . collection combinationof procedures , instructions algorithms set machines computers behaviour basedon environment input . Software intangible good non-rivalrous since itis characterized zero ( quasi zero ) marginal costs . Arthur investigated since the80s economic features software generally intangible digital technologies aswell effects business economy whole , see Arthur ( 1989 , 1990 , 1994,1996 ) . particular , pointed existence two different economic realities : theso-called diminishing increasing returns world . former represented traditionalmass-production systems whose products require huge amount resources relativelylower contribution knowledge , whereas latter represented high-tech companiessuch digital technologies producers : products characterized high knowledgecontent scarce quantity resources . Several economic features distinguish increasingreturns business worlds traditional bulk-production worlds . Arthur mentions networkeffects , positive feedback , path dependence , winner-takes-most/-takes-all outcomes , thentechnological lock-in . particular , positive feedbacks reinforce market position growingcompanies , time , negatively affect producers declining market share.In age intelligent machines digital automation , software , databases , artificialintelligence algorithms , sort intangible digital technologies playing anincreasingly dominant role far-reaching impact working economies.A recent popular book Haskel Westlake ( 2017 ) emphasizes increasing weightof intangible investments economy analyses consequences . particular , theauthors point four main features characterize intangible goods , so-called four1.1 Digital intangible assets : literature review 3 “ '' : scalability , sunk costs , spillovers , synergies . Scalability related non-rivalrousproperty intangible goods zero ( quasi zero ) marginal costs , see also Rifkin ( 2014 ) . Usually , firms producing type goods face high fixed costs , generally given byresearch and/or development costs , compared variable production costs . Furthermore , times , intangible investments represent sunk costs . typical example made bysoftware realized specific firms purposes ; although software represents assetfor , case exit market , difficult recover initial investment.Intangible investments tend generate spillover since may difficult expensive toprotect new knowledge generation companies benefit copying imitatingnew ideas . Finally , combination different intangible assets together ( hardware ) spurs innovations , e.g . organizational level , increase companies ’ profitability.In words , synergies create value firms , “ intangible economy '' , thewillingness increase revenues led so-called “ open innovation '' . factassumes crucial importance , wider perspective , nature technologicalinnovation progress interpreted based synergies different andexisting technologies , argued Arthur ( 2009 ) .It worth noting non-rivalrous digital assets cover intangible invest-ments , include also relevant assets , like patents , organizational innovations , orinvestments marketing brand . However , era intelligent machines digitalautomation , software , databases artificial intelligence algorithms clearly deserve thehighest attention among different kinds intangible investments.The increasing importance digital technologies also shown digital platforms , likeAmazon , Deliveroo , Glovo , Foodora Uber , typical examples non rivalrousservices considerably affected economic system employment andworking condition perspective , see Kenney Zysman ( 2019 ) . so-called “ digitaltaylorism '' emerged , platforms ’ algorithms able control , evaluate andto organize labour activities . Moreover , case Foodora Uber , authorsargue entrepreneurial risk transferred companies workers , see Dosi andRoventini ( 2019 ) .A considerable effort spent years order asses impact intangibleassets productivity firm , industry national level , see Corrado et al .

Edquist et al .

However , expansion market occurs1.3 Digital technological progress potential consequences labour market 13at expense competitors causes negative overall effect employment atthe industry-level.According so-called “ Compensation Theory '' , negative effects linked labour-unfriendly process innovation counteracted several economic forces triggered thetechnological progress , see Petit ( 1993 ) . respect , Vivarelli ( 2014 ) distinguishesbetween six different compensation effects : compensation mechanism “ via additionalemployment capital goods sector '' , “ via decrease prices '' , “ via new investments '' , “ viadecrease wages '' , “ via increase incomes '' “ via new products '' . Similarly , according toAcemoglu Restrepo ( 2018a ) , so-called “ displacement effect '' caused adoptionof digital technologies within production processes counteracted four countervailingeffects : productivity effect , capital accumulation , deepening automation thecreation new labour-intensive tasks . particular , authors creation newtasks jobs human labour comparative advantage compared capitalrepresents effective force capable balancing replacement workers withautomated machines . According Vermeulen Pyka ( 2014 ) , countervailingeffects triggered technological progress , diffusion artificial intelligence ( AI ) robots determining typical structural change rather so-called “ end ofwork '' .However , worth highlighting nature new digital technological waveexperienced society completely different compared previous ones . ofinnovations introduced within production systems end XXth century thepurpose produce huge amount mechanical energy allowing surmount limitsimposed human physical force . mentioned first section chapter , nowadays , according Brynjolfsson McAfee ( 2014 ) , experiencing new technologicalrevolution called “ Second Machine Age '' . new era , trough adoption ofnew digital technologies AI , overcome limits imposed mind .

Current literature includes different methods havebeen developed order assess unemployment , productivity change wage inequalityderiving digital transformation . One represented including AI withinproduction functions new ( production ) factor , see DeCanio ( 2016 ) ; Hanson ( 2001 ) ; Lankisch et al . ( 2019 ) . Moreover , pointed Acemoglu Restrepo ( 2018d ) , severalresearchers modelled introduction automation AI manufacturing sectoras factor augmenting technical change digital transformation represented anincrease factor productivity , see Acemoglu ( 2003 ) . instance , Graetz Michaels ( 2018 ) ; Nordhaus ( 2015 ) ; Sachs Kotlikoff ( 2012 ) frame automation AI impactas capital-augmenting technical change , whereas Bessen ( 2016 , 2018 , 2019 ) representsautomation labour-augmenting.2.2 added value agent based modelling 16It worth noting Acemoglu Restrepo ( 2017 , 2018a , b , c , ) point someweaknesses factor augmenting approach equilibrium models1 adopt so-called task-based approach based pioneering contribution Zeira ( 1998 ) : automationadvent represented increase number tasks performed machines.Similarly , Aghion et al .

Differently structural macro models 70s,1Acemoglu Restrepo ( 2018d ) argue “ factor-augmenting technologies limited scope reducethe demand labor '' . Another criticism made authors refers impact technology onlabour share national income : strictly related elasticity substitution production factors.Conversely , argue task-based approach “ always reduces labor share reduces labor demandand equilibrium wage unless productivity gains automation sufficiently large . `` 2.2 added value agent based modelling 17agent-based macroeconomics introduce explicit micro-foundations based empiricallyobserved behaviours individuals organizations .

Obviously , means number employees DADs sector is2.3 Eurace model intangible digital assets 30influenced revenues , also average wage characterising economy.Basically , DADs embodie essence Schumpeterian entrepreneurship : represent theengine innovation technological progress within Eurace macroeconomic system.Concerning hiring process , DADs enter labour market perform exactly thesame procedures CGPs compete labour force . However , animportant difference : CGPs hire households highest ( fifth level ) lowest ( first ) education level indistinctly , yet prioritising highly educated workers , DADs employonly workers high degree education ( third level upwards ) employ themin research activities develop new intangible digital assets.2.3.5 Demand sideIntangible digital assets demanded CGPs pay user licence DADs fortheir utilisation . particular , digital assets , namely software , integrated within “ hard '' capital purchased KGP . “ Hard '' capital shall considered generalized mean ofproduction represents physical part : machine tools , computerized numericalcontrol machines , robots , computing equipment ( computer hardware ) , communicationsequipment , etc . means production need software order work ; regard , isassumed unit “ hard '' capital needs associated digital asset license .
