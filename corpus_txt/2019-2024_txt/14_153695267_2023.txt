Moreover , complex nature interventions often adequately incorporated evidence policymakers . study aims systematically review evaluate factors affecting NCD policy adoption implementation . Methods : conducted complex systematic review articles discussing adoption implementation 's ‘ best buys ' NCD policies . identified political economy factors constructed causal loop diagram ( CLD ) program theory elucidate interplay factors influencing NCD policy adoption implementation . total 157 papers met inclusion criteria . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL HEALTH POLICY MANAGEMENT ( IJHPM ) ONLINE ISSN : 2322-5939 JOURNAL HOMEPAGE : HTTPS : //WWW.IJHPM.COM 3 Results : CLD highlights central feedback loop encompassing three vital variables : 1 ) ability define , ( ) shape pass appropriate policy law ; 2 ) ability implement policy ( linked enforceability policy addressing NCD local burden ) ; 3 ) ability monitor progress , evaluate correct course . Insufficient context-specific data impedes formulation enactment suitable policies , particularly areas facing multiple disease burdens . Multisectoral collaboration plays pivotal role policy adoption implementation . Effective monitoring accountability systems significantly impact policy implementation . commercial determinants health ( CDoH ) serve major barrier defining , adopting , implementing tobacco , alcohol , diet-related policies . Conclusion : advance global efforts , recommend focusing development robust accountability , monitoring , evaluation systems , ensuring transparency private sector engagement , supporting context-specific data collection , effectively managing CDoH . system thinking approach enhance implementation complex public health interventions . Keywords : Best Buys ; NCD Policy ; Complexity Theory Background burden noncommunicable diseases ( NCDs ) ( cardiovascular , diabetes , lung diseases , cancer ) remains high 1 , governments health systems ( HS ) face increasing challenge preventing , controlling , managing chronic disease care . Estimates suggest least 71 % adult deaths low- middle-income countries ( LMICs ) today due diseases 2 3 . Managing controlling NCDs preventable risk factors – chiefly diet , tobacco , physical inactivity , alcohol , well social determinants – require coordinated effort work across sectors . 2011 World Health Organization ( ) developed set interventions – so-called ‘ best buys ’ recommended adoption implementation 4 5 , reviewed expanded 2023 6 . ‘ best buys ’ options cover four key risk factors NCDs ( tobacco , harmful use alcohol , unhealthy diet , physical inactivity ) four key disease areas ( cardiovascular disease , diabetes , cancer , chronic respiratory disease ) . Examples ‘ best buys ’ include : increasing excise taxes prices tobacco alcohol purchases ; reducing salt behavior change communication mass media campaigns , reformulating food products , front-of-package labelling ; physical activity campaigns ; drug therapy counseling heart attack stroke7 .
