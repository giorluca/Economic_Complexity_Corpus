Economic Evaluation MethodsThe studies divided using classical economic indicators using thenew age models.The classic economic indicators involve ratio indicators assess company ’ performancein terms profitability , activity , debt , liquidity . ratio relative growth indicated theelasticity indicators . standard financial performance indicators include absolute value profit , cash flow ( direct , indirect ) , profitability indicators . rate return indicators assesses abilityof company make profit using invested capital . time axis , indicators shouldmanifest increasing tendency . indicators include return assets ( ROA ) , return equity ( ROE ) , return sales ( ROS ) , return capital employed ( ROCE ) . traditional indicators anintegral part evaluation company ’ performance , subject criticism becausethey take account risk , effect inflation , time value money . ofthese classic indicators based accounting data particular , company ’ economicresults . weaknesses financial analysis make results less valuable less useful.Since 1980s , performance begun viewed ability create value owners . Themajor aspects performance , also time aspect respect expectations future profits , aswell important influence risk . Increasingly important also indicators economicvalue added ( EVA ) , discounted cash flow ( DCF ) , market value added ( MVA ) , excess return ( ER ) , andtotal shareholder return ( TSR ) , indicators take account goals interestedparties , i.e. , stakeholders . new indicators already take account impact inflation , risk , cost capital.Finally , third last group known new age methods , characteristicallyhighly complex also specific , hence efficient , tend work robust set data.Korol Kolodi [ 23 ] proposed fuzzy logic model uses dynamic financial ratios input . Sun , Shang et al .

Legislative EnvironmentIn May 2017 , EU Medical Devices Regulation ( MDR ) passed European Parliament , gave companies MedTech industry 3 5 years fulfill compliance criteria set bythe regulation , including establishing new procedures marketing approval newly developedSustainability 2020 , 12 , 1755 6 27products reauthorization products , already available internal market . goal thenew regulation bring field MDs closer standards safety set pharmaceuticalindustry renew trust MedTech industry high-profile breast implant scandal andhip replacement failures . main change regulatory framework focus safety , isto achieved strict processes leading market authorization declaration conformity andobtaining CE marking . MedTech companies must implement new quality assurance standards tointroduce unique device identification allows authorities trace individual devices throughthe supply chain simplify recalls case emergency situations . Medtech companies haveto create position person responsible regulatory compliance , similar pharmaceuticalindustry qualified person , responsible aspects compliance MDR.Moreover , obtain MDR authorization class III implantable devices , MedTechcompanies required present notified body large volume clinical data supportsthe clinical performance products . Another key factor monitoring device performanceby post-marketing surveillance , similar processes used pharmaceutical industry [ 37 ] .
