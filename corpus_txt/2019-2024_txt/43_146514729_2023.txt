Introduction One consider asset-pricing puzzle two-part problem . first one describes asset pricing portfolio models assumption predictions price return probabilities given . second one derives forecasts price return probabilities , average values volatilities horizon , using various models , mostly based first part . However , market-based choice asset price probability prediction horizon hides essential difficulties economic nature , significantly limit accuracy price probability forecasts well reliability asset pricing portfolio theories . recent decades , asset price theories obtained many important results , references ( Markowitz , 1952 ; Sharpe , 1964 ; Fama , 1965 ; Merton , 1973 ; Fama , 1990 ; Cochrane , 2001 ; Fama French , 2015 ; Campbell , 2018 ) present millesimal part current studies . Actually , foundation modern asset pricing theories remains rather peculiar based `` highly restrictive undoubtedly unrealistic assumptions. ” ( Sharpe , 1964 ) , Sharpe ’ opinion “ …the proper test theory realism assumptions acceptability implications… ” 60 years later , generally accepted still use . predictions average price , return , volatilities establish separate , important field research covered numerous studies asset pricing theories . price forecasting considered within economic forecasting ( Diebold , 1999 ; Snowberg , Wolfers , Zitzewitz , 2012 ) , time series analysis ( Davis , 1941 ; Brockwell Davis , 2002 ) , Monte-Carlo simulations ( McLeish , 2005 ) , , last decade , intensive studies machine learning AI methods evaluating stock price predictions ( Cao et al. , 2021 ; Kelly Xiu , 2023 ) . refer papers indicate forecasting methods , ’ consider reasonable review broad important research . However , current models stock price price probability forecasts , well asset pricing theories , may omit important factors interrelations determine dependence market-based price probability market trade randomness . turn , predictions market trade stochasticity based general economic models link market trade evolution economic development . rather complex problems resolved one paper , make attempt figure significant factors relations vitally impact predictability price return probabilities . paper , present pure theoretical consideration market-based price return probabilities general economic context highlight economic obstacles 3 essentially limit accuracy forecasts probabilities horizon T. well known ( Shephard , 1991 ; Shiryaev , 1999 ; Shreve , 2004 ) probability measure , characteristic function , set statistical moments present almost equal descriptions random variable . paper , consider finite number statistical moments tool approximate predictions price return probabilities . study economic obstacles vastly limit ability consider predict many statistical moments significantly restrict accuracy forecasts price return probabilities . forecast statistical moments price return stocks particular company , one estimates similar forecasts stocks traded market . Obviously , predictions economic variables impossible without knowledge , forecasts , estimates economic environment . derive forecasts economic environment , consider consecutive approximations market-based statistical moments price return , determined statistical moments market trade values volumes . start description market-based statistical moments price returns stocks individual companies . , consider risk ratings , take continuous numeric values . show description m-th statistical moments trade values volumes m=1,2 , .. n , depends assessments risk ratings traded companies . describe n-th statistical moments trading stocks company , action single risk , one estimate risk ratings form n-dimensional vector x = ( x1 , ... xn ) . component xm , m=1,2 , .. n risk vector x estimated using economic variables m-th order , determined sums m-th powers economic financial transactions . show usage risk coordinates x= ( x1 , ... xn ) allows making transition description statistical moments stocks individual companies description collective statistical moments stocks companies risk ratings neighborhood vector x= ( x1 , ... xn ) . transition describes continuous economic media approximation models price return statistical moments stocks functions time risk vector x . Subsequent approximations describe statistical moments collective trade , price , returns stocks traded market functions time . derive successive approximations , one average market trade time series sequential time intervals ε < < Δ ≤ Δx ≤ Δx . ε denote constant period market trades , could second even fraction second . assess statistical moments market trades , price , return stocks particular company 4 reasonable time interval Δ , one average initial market transactions Δ . derive continuous economic media approximation describe price return statistical moments functions time coordinates x , one sum market trades stocks companies risk coordinates neighborhood vector x economic domain average time series interval Δx . derive statistical moments price return whole stock market , one sum trades stocks companies market average time series Δm . derive equations , describe dynamics additive economic variables functions ( , x ) equations collective variables whole market functions time . slow evolution time trade statistical moments whole stock market serve economic environment description price statistical moments continuous economic media approximation functions ( , x ) . solutions equations continuous economic media approximation horizon establish ground estimates price return statistical moments stocks particular company . , investor estimate possible risk ratings xq= ( xq1 , …xqn ) company q horizon T. investor could map anticipated assessment risk forecast collective trade statistical moments functions ( , x ) estimate statistical moments return stocks company q horizon T. completely determines statistical moments price horizon . origin economic obstacles , limit predictive capacity accuracy price return probabilities , lies fact one approximate finite number n market-based statistical moments . m-th statistical moment m=1,2 , .. n price return determined m-th statistical moments market trade values volumes averaged time interval Δ , Δx Δm . averaging interval contains finite number market trades , limits number statistical moments estimated . increase accuracy current price probability , one enlarge averaging time interval assess statistical moments . However , ambition vastly limited two reasons . First , increase time-averaging interval reduces ability make prompt investment decisions . second , much significant economic barrier , determined irremovable growth complexity forecasting extra trade statistical moment . show sections 3 5 , extra m-th statistical moment price return , increase accuracy predicted probabilities , creates one additional tough problem economic description . show sums m-th powers market trade values volumes , well sums m-th powers 5 economic financial trades made averaging interval , determine economic variables m-th order . example , conventional economic investments Δ determined sums ( without duplication ) first power investment transactions made agents Δ . Similar , call “ m-th investments ” sums m-th powers investment transactions Δ . denote economic variables variables m-th order . mutual interactions economic variables m-th order establish economic problems almost similar complex description conventional macroeconomic theories , model relations variables first order . turn , assessments risk ratings companies , must use economic variables m-th order , result derivation components xm risk vector x= ( x1 , …xn ) . complexity economic modeling m-th order strong rise uncertainty driven estimates additional component xm risk vector x= ( x1 , …xn ) , greatly limit number statistical moments could predicted , significantly diminish accuracy price return probabilities forecasts . Actually , stocks traded modern markets mostly subject several risks . estimates ratings several risks j=1,2 , .. J , use economic variables m-th order m=1 , …n , produce risk ratings company matrix variables x= ( xmj ) , m=1 , .. n ; j=1,2 , .. J . , J determines number risks , n determines number statistical moments price return predicted model . Numerous risks , impact stocks trading , additionally increase complexity economic modeling reduce accuracy predictions price return probabilities . Eventually , findings briefly stated follows : current markets provide lot trading data period ε , allows assess “ today ” many – 10 , 20 - statistical moments market trade , price , return reasonable averaging interval equal hours days . helps “ today ” approximate probabilities price return high accuracy . However , predictions statistical moments horizon meet irremovable barriers economic complexity . predictions 2-d statistical moments price return need forecasts 2-d statistical moments market trade . turn , requires economic theory 2-d order . predictions 3-d , 4-th , etc. , statistical moments require corresponding economic models 3-d 4-th orders , even complex . assessments risk ratings determined economic variables 2-d , 3-d , 4-th order increase model complexity . coming years , best scenario , accuracy forecasts limited 2-d statistical moments , hence market-based price probability forecasts limited 6 Gaussian distributions extensions ( see App . ) . ignorance limits driven existing economic complexity may allow one derive forecasts price return statistical moments probabilities , high uncertainty makes predictions useless . rest paper organized follows : section 2 , consider market-based statistical moments price return . section 3 , discuss vector nature ratings single risk x= ( x1 , …xn ) . , discuss statistical moments returns stocks companies risk ratings neighborhood risk vector x statistical moments stocks companies traded whole market . section 4 , consider statistical moments stock price , determined statistical moments returns . section 5 , discuss complexities would face investor attempts forecast price return probabilities stocks company using predictions collective economic environment market continuous economic media approximation . Section 6 : Conclusion . Appendix , present simple approximations characteristic functions probability measures finite number statistical moments . Appendix B , introduce main notions equations describe dynamics collective economic variables continuous economic media approximation approximation whole market . paper novices , believe readers already know find definitions , terms , models given text . assume readers familiar conventional issues economic theory , asset pricing portfolio theories , risk assessment , basics probability theory , statistical moments , characteristic functions , partial differential equations , etc . use roman letters , B , denote scalars bold B , P , denote vectors matrices . Reference ( 3.5 ) means equation 5 section 3 . 2 . Market-based statistical moments price return assume market trades stocks company made time ti constant interval ε trades : 𝜀 − 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡 ; 𝑡𝑖 = 𝑡0 + 𝑖𝜀 ; 𝑖 = 0,1 , … ( 2.1 ) trade time series ti introduces initial market time axis division multiple ε ( 2.1 ) . initial data , consider time series trade values C ( ti ) volumes U ( ti ) stocks times ti , determine trade price p ( ti ) due trivial equation : 𝐶 ( 𝑡𝑖 ) = 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑖 ) 𝑈 ( 𝑡𝑖 ) ; 𝑖 = 0,1 , … ( 2.2 ) 7 Equation ( 2.2 ) defines market trade price p ( ti ) stocks individual company ti . initial time axis division ε equal second even fraction second . time series trade value C ( ti ) , volume U ( ti ) price p ( ti ) irregular little help predictions stock price time horizon equal weeks , months , years . One consider market time series random variables reasonable time interval Δ > > ε . simplicity , take Δ multiple ε ( 2.3 ) N terms time series ti inside Δ . develop pricing model horizon > > ε one average initial random market time series interval Δ ( 2.3 ) : ∆= 𝑁𝜀 ; 𝑁 ≫ 1 ; 𝜀 ≪ ∆ < 𝑇 ( 2.3 ) averaging market time series Δ ( 2.3 ) , one obtains smooth data useful forecasting horizon T. Averaged time series introduce transition initial market time axis division multiple ε new one , rougher time axis division multiple Δ . Market trades stocks company determine three initial time series financial variables taken account pricing model : trade value C ( ti ) , volume U ( ti ) price p ( ti ) ( 2.2 ) . impossible independently define probabilities trade value C ( ti ) , volume U ( ti ) price p ( ti ) match equation ( 2.2 ) . given probabilities trade value C ( ti ) volume U ( ti ) determine probability price p ( ti ) ( 2.2 ) . consider random time series trade values C ( ti ) volumes U ( ti ) primary , completely determine stochasticity market price p ( ti ) . support statement , refer Fox et al . ( 2017 ) , provides perfect methodology estimating national accounts basis aggregation additive economic variables ground definition non-additive variables price , inflation , bank rates , etc . follow Fox et al . ( 2017 ) consider additive random variables determined time series trade values C ( ti ) volumes U ( ti ) basis describing stochastic properties stock price return . Assume averaging interval Δ defines time axis division tk , k=0,1 , .. multiple Δ : ∆𝑘= [ 𝑡𝑘 − ∆2 ; 𝑡𝑘 + ∆2 ] ; 𝑡𝑘 = 𝑡0 + ∆ ∙ 𝑘 ; 𝑘 = 0 , 1 , 2 , … ( 2.4 ) convenience , renumber initial trade time series ti ( 2.1 ; 2.3 ) note tik , belong interval Δk ( 2.4 ) : 𝑡𝑘 − ∆2 ≤ 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ≤ 𝑡𝑘 + ∆2 ; 𝑡𝑖+1 , 𝑘 − 𝑡𝑖𝑘 = 𝜀 ; 𝑡𝑖 , 𝑘+1 − 𝑡𝑖𝑘 = ∆ ; 𝑖 = 1 , . . 𝑁 ( 2.5 ) Thus , consider N terms time series tik interval Δk ( 2.4 ) . allows equally assessing statistical moments market trade value C ( tk ; n ) volume U ( tk ; n ) averaging interval Δk ( 2.6 ) : 8 𝐶 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) ≡ 𝐸 [ 𝐶𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) ] ~ 1𝑁 ∑ 𝐶𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 ; 𝑈 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) ≡ 𝐸 [ 𝑈𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) ] ~ 1𝑁 ∑ 𝑈𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 ( 2.6 ) Actually , initial time series tik interval Δk ( 2.5 ) presents discrete data , data available trades period ε . However , averaging initial discrete time series interval Δk results continuous time model . One use moving average smoothing procedure define ( 2.6 ) continuous time model . use notation tk ( 2.6 ) outline particular time interval Δk ( 2.5 ) , results definition ( 2.6 ) . use symbol ~ underline relations ( 2.6 ) define assessments mathematical expectation E [ .. ] finite number N terms time series belong interval Δk ( 2.5 ) . n-th power equation ( 2.2 ) time tik gives : 𝐶𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) = 𝑝𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑈𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) ; 𝑛 = 1,2 , … ( 2.7 ) Equation ( 2.7 ) introduces price n-th statistical moments ( Olkhov , 2021a ; 2022a ; 2023a ) way parallels definition volume weighted average price ( VWAP ) ( Berkowitz et al. , 1983 ; Duffie Dworczak , 2018 ) : 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) ≡ 𝐸 [ 𝑝𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) ] = 1∑ 𝑈𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑝𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑈𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 ( 2.8 ) Relations ( 2.6 - 2.8 ) give : 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) = ∑ 𝐶𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑁𝑖=1∑ 𝑈𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 = 𝐶 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) 𝑈 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) ( 2.9 ) 𝐶 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) = 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) 𝑈 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) ( 2.10 ) first statistical moment price p ( tk ; 1 ) completely coincides VWAP . well known one equally describe random variable probability measure , characteristic function , set statistical moments ( Shephard , 1991 ; Shiryaev , 1999 ; Shreve , 2004 ) . Thus , market-based statistical moments price ( 2.8-2.10 ) completely describe price random variable Δk . finite number N marker trades reasonable interval Δ results one assess finite number statistical moments trade value C ( tk ; n ) volume U ( tk ; n ) ( 2.6 ) . Hence , one assess finite number statistical moments price ( 2.8-2.10 ) . finite number price statistical moments p ( tk ; n ) approximates market-based price characteristic function probability ( Appendix ) . market-based price statistical moments ( 2.8-2.10 ) differ frequency-based price statistical moments π ( tk ; n ) : 𝜋 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) ~ 1𝑁 ∑ 𝑝𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 = 1𝑁 ∑ 𝐶𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑈𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 determined probability P ( p ) ~ ( p ) /N , proportional number ( p ) trades price p total number trades equals N interval Δ . economic nature distinctions conventional frequency-based market-based price 9 statistical moments follows : market-based price statistical moments ( 2.8-2.10 ) take account impact size market ’ trade values volumes . growth n , price n-th statistical moments ( 2.8-2.10 ) take account contribution market trades huge values volumes . Contrary , frequency-based statistical moments π ( tk ; n ) describe price statistics determined frequencies price . market-based price statistical moments p ( tk ; n ) equal conventional frequency-based statistical moments π ( tk ; n ) trade volumes U ( tk ) equal 1 . approximation far reality financial market trade . market-based probability stock price return described Olkhov ( 2021a ; 2022a ; 2023a ; 2023b ) , refer details . Predictions price probability horizon tK =T ∆𝐾= [ 𝑡𝐾 − ∆2 ; 𝑡𝐾 + ∆2 ] ; 𝑇 = 𝑡𝐾 = 𝑡0 + ∆ ∙ 𝐾 ( 2.11 ) require forecasting statistical moments trade values volumes ( 2.6 ) horizon tK =T . trade statistical moments predicted , higher accuracy market-based probability stock price . describe statistical moments stock return investor sells stocks time tik Δk ( 2.4 ; 2.5 ) , previously purchased time tik-ξ one consider trade equation ( 2.2 ) interval Δk ( 2.5 ) follows : 𝐶 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) = 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑈 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) = 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 − 𝜉 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 − 𝜉 ) 𝑈 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) = 𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) 𝑆 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) denote return r ( tik , ξ ) ratio price p ( tik ) moment tik ( 2.5 ) price p ( tik-ξ ) past time ti , k -ξ . convenience , take time shift ξ multiple ε : 𝑆 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) ≡ 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 − 𝜉 ) 𝑈 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) ; 𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) ≡ 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘−𝜉 ) ; 𝜉 = 𝜀 𝑗 ( 2.12 ) simplify notations , denote time shift ξ without index j ( 2.12 ) . denote ( tik , ξ ) past value volume U ( tik ) stocks time tik-ξ price p ( tik-ξ ) . Using ( 2.2 ; 2.12 ) , present return trade equation ( 2.13 ) : 𝐶 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) = 𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) 𝑆 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) ( 2.13 ) Similar ( 2.6 ) , introduce statistical moments past value ( tik , ξ ) ( 2.12 ) determined volume U ( tik ) stocks price p ( tik-ξ ) : 𝑆 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) ≡ 𝐸 [ 𝑆𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) ] ~ 1𝑁 ∑ 𝑆𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) =𝑁𝑖=1 1𝑁 ∑ 𝑝𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 − 𝜉 ) 𝑈𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) =𝑁𝑖=1 ( 2.14 ) n-th power ( 2.13 ) gives 𝐶𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖 , 𝑘 ) = 𝑟𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) 𝑆𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) ( 2.15 ) 10 Similar ( 2.8-2.10 ) , define n-th statistical moments return r ( tk , ξ ; n ) stocks time tk respect time shift ξ past tk-ξ : 𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) ≡ 𝐸 [ 𝑟𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) ] = 1∑ 𝑆𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 ∑ 𝑟𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) 𝑆𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 ( 2.16 ) 𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) = ∑ 𝐶𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 ) 𝑁𝑖=1∑ 𝑆𝑛 ( 𝑡𝑖𝑘 , 𝜉 ) 𝑁𝑖=1 = 𝐶 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) 𝑆 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) ( 2.17 ) 𝐶 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) = 𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) 𝑆 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) ( 2.18 ) finite number statistical moments return r ( tk , ξ ; n ) determine approximations return characteristic function probability measure alike approximations market-based price probability ( Appendix ) . details market-based probability stock return , refer Olkhov ( 2023a ; 2023b ) . Relations ( 2.9 ; 2.10 ) price statistical moments p ( tk ; n ) relations ( 2.17 ; 2.18 ) statistical moments stock return r ( tk , ξ ; n ) establish mutual relations : 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) 𝑈 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) = 𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) 𝑆 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) ( 2.19 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) = 𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) 𝑆 ( 𝑡𝑘 , 𝜉 ; 𝑛 ) 𝑈 ( 𝑡𝑘 ; 𝑛 ) ( 2.20 ) Relations ( 2.19 ; 2.20 ) prove one define price statistical moments , characteristic function , price probability measure using statistical moments stock return r ( tk , ξ ; n ) vice versa . forecast price probability , sufficient predict probability return , vice versa . problems complement completely . One forecast return statistical moments , enough predict price statistical moments . However , predictions market-based statistical moments price return stock company impossible without knowledge financial market “ environment ” : estimates price return stocks traded market . describe statistical moments numerous stocks traded NYSE Nasdaq , one distribute different stocks certain parameters distinguish . parameter helps develop distribution different stocks , select risk ratings issuer companies . next section , explain assessments risk ratings issuer companies traded market introduce notion risk coordinates economic domain describe market-based statistical moments stock return functions risk coordinates . 3 . market-based statistical moments stock return functions risk section , describe statistical moments stock return functions risk ratings , consider coordinates economic domain ( Olkhov , 2016a-2020 ) . , major risk agencies , Fitch , Moody ’ , & P , assess risk ratings 11 majority stocks , major banks , corporations ( Metz Cantor , 2007 ; Chane-Kon et al. , 2010 ; Kraemer Vazza , 2012 ) . Risk agencies use letter notations AAA , AA , BB , C designate risk rate . rating agency letter grade system protect promote business . However , 80 years ago , Durand ( 1941 ) proposed use numerical risk grades . Indeed , risk ratings conditional terms used economics finance helpful tools sustainable management , investment , economic modeling . Primarily , risk notations support problems economic modeling promotion particular business . use numeric risk grades support unified methodology risk assessments different agencies opens wide opportunities economic financial modeling . take idea numeric risk grades proposed Durand ( 1941 ) complement introducing continuous numeric risk grades . notions secure risky grades entirely contingent , symbol AAA easily replaced numeric value . take secure risk grade equal 0 risky grade equal 1 . Thus , replace letter-based risk grade symbols AAA , BB , CC continuous numeric risk grades fill unit interval [ 0,1 ] , call economic domain . one considers economic system action J risks , numeric values agents ’ risk grades fill economic domain unit cube [ 0,1 ] J RJ . description economic agents risk coordinates economic domain gives great advantages economic financial modeling reveals hidden economic factors processes impact economic evolution forecasting . Continuous numeric risk grades distribute market stocks risk coordinates . helps develop description statistical moments market trades , prices , returns , taking account risk coordinates stocks company . simplicity , first stage , consider market trades action single risk . Even description statistical moments action single risk requires essential modification risk rating notion . 3.1 Risk ratings vector variables reconsider extend notion risk ratings manner match description set statistical moments functions risk . ’ discuss particular methodology assessment numeric risk ratings consider worthy task risk rating agencies . However , complexity financial markets description statistical moments stock prices returns tool approximations price return probabilities require significant complication risk rating notion . 12 consider conventional assessments risk ratings ( Metz Cantor , 2007 ; Chane-Kon et al. , 2010 ; Kraemer Vazza , 2012 ) zero approximation . Actually , substitution conventional letter designations risk ratings proposed numeric continuous risk ratings like opening hidden Pandora ’ box economic complexity . Indeed , one ask simple question : numeric risk rating economic agent scalar vector ? question almost impossible literal notations thus could surprise researchers . Actually , idea describing n-th statistical moments market trade value C ( tk ; n ) volume U ( tk ; n ) ( 2.6 ) , statistical moments price p ( tk ; n ) ( 2.8-2.10 ) , return r ( tk , ξ ; n ) ( 2.16-2.18 ) stocks company functions company ’ risk rating x simple . risk rating x serve coordinates describe evolution company ’ economic financial variables statistical moments particular . However , identify m-th statistical moments return r ( tk , ξ ; ) ( 2.16 ) m=1,2 , …n , one assess component xm using economic variables m-th order . risk rating company economic model describes n statistical moments takes form n-dimensional vector x= ( x1 , …xn ) . example , compare two statistical moments trade value two companies b : Ca ( tk ; 1 ) , Ca ( tk ; 2 ) Cb ( tk ; 1 ) , Cb ( tk ; 2 ) . Assume Ca ( tk ; 1 ) =Cb ( tk ; 1 ) . reasonable assume risk coordinate x1 company , identifies Ca ( tk , x1 ; 1 ) almost equal risk coordinate y1 company b , identifies Cb ( tk , y1 ; 1 ) , x1~y1 . However , second statistical moments different Ca ( tk ; 2 ) > > Cb ( tk ; 2 ) , describe case , one needs additional variables x2 y2 take Ca ( tk , x2 ; 2 ) > > Cb ( tk , y2 ; 2 ) . Thus , describe set two statistical moments , one use vector x= ( x1 , x2 ) . description n statistical moments requires n-dimensional vector x= ( x1 , …xn ) . origin complexity risk ratings company relates complication economic model , takes account finite set m=1 , .. n statistical moments market trade values C ( tk ; n ) volumes U ( tk ; n ) ( 2.6 ) . Indeed , conventional economic models describe macroeconomic variables , composed sums first powers trade values volumes . example , macroeconomic investments , credits , consumption determined sums ( without doubling ) investment , credit , consumption transactions made agents entire economy interval Δ . One consider investment made agent time ti interval Δ market transaction , sum investments made agents interval Δ defines macroeconomic investments macroeconomic variable . underline sums taken first powers investment transactions . certain extent , conventional 13 economic models describe relations mutual dependence macroeconomic variables , composed sums first powers market transactions . convenience , note 1st order economic variables call conventional macroeconomics 1st order economic theory . Assessments risks company using economic variables 1st order , generate x1 component risk rating vector x= ( x1 , …xn ) . However , sums squares market trades , squares investment , credit , consumption transactions made agents introduce macroeconomic variables 2-d order . example , sums squares investments made agents interval Δ define investments 2-d order . sums squares credits Δ define credits 2-d order . consider description mutual dependence macroeconomic variables 2-d order 2-d order economic theory ( Olkhov , 2021b ; 2021c ; 2022b ) . description 2-d order macroeconomic variables description 2-d statistical moments market trade value C ( tk ; 2 ) volume U ( tk ; 2 ) ( 2.6 ) , 2-d statistical moments price p ( tk ; 2 ) return r ( tk , ξ ; 2 ) averaged Δ establish unified problem . Predictions 2-d statistical moments price p ( tk ; 2 ) return r ( tk , ξ ; 2 ) depend forecasting 2-d order variables . use 2-d order economic variables assess risk ratings company generates ratings x2 , serve coordinates 2-d statistical moments price , return , trade values , etc . Consequently , sums n-th order market trade values , investment transactions , etc. , Δ determine variables n-th order . Risk assessments based economic variables n-th order generate risk ratings xn n-th component risk rating vector x= ( x1 , …xn ) . Risk assessments depend complexity economic model . simplest case presented conventional economic models , based economic variables composed sums first powers economic financial transactions Δ . models assess average market price return functions x1 . However , predictions market-based volatilities price return require forecasts 2-d statistical moments market trade value C ( tk ; 2 ) volume U ( tk ; 2 ) ( 2.6 ) 2-d order economic theory . predictions set m-th statistical moments m=1 , …n price p ( tk ; ) ( 2.8-2.10 ) return r ( tk , ξ ; ) ( 2.16-2.18 ) approximate price return probabilities require economic models m-th order m=1,2 , .. n. assessments risks based economic variables m-th order generate xm components risk rating vector x= ( x1 , …xn ) . show , predictions risk rating vector x= ( x1 , …xn ) company horizon determine finite number m=1 , .. n statistical moments return r ( tk , ξ , xj ; ) define approximations return price probabilities . 14 3.2 Statistical moments return functions time risk coordinates section , consider statistical moments ( 2.6 ) market trade values C ( tk , xqm ; ) volumes U ( tk , xqm ; ) , statistical moments ( tk , ξ , xqm ; ) ( 2.14 ) , statistical moments price p ( tk , xqm ; ) ( 2.8-2.10 ) return r ( tk , ξ , xqm ; ) ( 2.16-2.18 ) stocks company q functions xqm component risk vector xq= ( xq1 , …xqn ) m=1,2 , .. n. consider transition description statistical moments stocks particular company functions risk coordinates xq= ( xq1 , …xqn ) description collective statistical moments stocks companies , risk coordinates neighborhood vector x= ( x1 , …xn ) . economic domain model , describes m=1,2 , .. n statistical moments market trades , price , return , take ( 3.1 ) : 𝒙 ∈ [ 0,1 ] 𝑛 ; 𝒙 = ( 𝑥1 , … 𝑥𝑛 ) ; 0 ≤ 𝑥𝑚 ≤ 1 ; 𝑚 = 1 , … 𝑛 ( 3.1 ) 2022 , NYSE traded around 2500 stocks Nasdaq traded almost 3600 stocks domestic international companies ( Statista , 2023 ) .
