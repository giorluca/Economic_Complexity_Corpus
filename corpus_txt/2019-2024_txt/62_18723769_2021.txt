economic complexity theory tell us EU ’ pandemic recovery resilience plans economic complexity theory tell us aboutthe EU ’ pandemic recovery resilience plansA little year ago , EU ’ political leaders agreed unprecedented fiscal package – dubbed ‘ NextGeneration EU ’ – aid Europe ’ recovery pandemic . Ricardo Hausmann , Miguel Angel Santos , Corrado Macchiarelli Renato Giacon write economic complexity theories provide useful tool forevaluating whether recovery resilience plans submitted EU member states receive funding arewell-designed . Assessing case Greece , argue investments tailored toward export-oriented sectors aim help close country ’ product complexity gap EU states.There increasing evidence directing investments towards complex less ubiquitous products canhelp countries improve growth prospects , without undermining importance accumulation factors ofproduction physical human capital , role institutional measures good governance andthe rule law . Complexity must build strong path dependence incrementing country ’ pasteconomic capabilities.The EU Recovery Resilience Facility ( RRF ) , centrepiece Next Generation EU ( NGEU ) programmelaunched July 2020 , enshrines twin priorities ‘ green ’ ‘ digital ’ transition , focusing raising EU ’ spotential growth , improving long-term fiscal sustainability , helping economic convergence across Union , rather achieving short-term fiscal stabilisation Covid-19 pandemic.Could theories economic complexity used assess validity Recovery Resilience Facility ?
