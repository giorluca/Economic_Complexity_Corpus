One could therefore expect transition fossil paradigm core Industrial revolution current digital paradigm might deeply influence today ’ society probably housing since history dwelling shows dif-ferent forms social stratification co-evolved dif-ferent housing types , producing several ways living cities homes.Just modern housing primarily answer needs industrial working class—a circumstance much irritated Tom Wolfe ( 1981 ) , outraged socialist aesthetics spreading among north American elite—might contemporary housing evolve together diffusion Wark calls hacker class , kinds workers digital economy ? Purposely leaving background environmental financial issues , also question traditional spatial organisation houses , paper tries detect traces evidence change housing , induced new ways production influences everyday life.Reducing complexity : housing Second Industrial RevolutionAt beginning Second Industrial Revolution , architecture started cope housing crisis throughout Europe.The change production methods established dis-continuity past , localisation production sites , since fossil fuels allowed locate fac-tories far watercourses , windy hills energy sources , organisation time , working hours became independent seasons avail-ability natural resources . Peasants became workforce , leave countryside move closer factories . Thus new means production , chang-ing working conditions , structurally altered rela-tionship people places , clearing way deep changes culture habits.These changes directly concerned urban planning architecture . important European cit-ies dealt emerging issues shifting 19th-century city 20th-century metropolis , process developed scale city scale dwelling.The first radical change definitive separation work life , contrast pre-modern household , spatial structure organises greater part activities needed survive integrating work fam-ily life . farms workshops , whole family generations , different families , participate daily work without actual separation family care labour , neither space , time ( Junestrand Tollmar 1998 ) .The establishment factories disrupted substan-tial continuity . Work labour longer part house , found appropriate well-organised spaces inside factories offices . Time split along space , coordinating effort workers living dif-ferent places required scheduling activities part day exclusively devoted work.Houses thus became place dedicated private sphere : personal needs , spare time activities , child care.Under pervasive influence Taylorism , hygienic issues equalitarian aspirations mainly solved “ gradual transformation life economy production ” ( Aureli 2014 ) . Domestic space “ longer conceived symbol kinship family bonds , infrastructure devoted reproduc-tion life ” , eventually resulted houses becom-ing housing , “ functioning house ” ( ibid . p. 30 ) .Thus , housing becomes piece urban infra-structure , losing specificity achieving status similar machine . need arises define qualities new product , first time comes object mass production.Housing becomes physical infrastructure political construction spatial arrangement frames role group within new society . Social housing especially becomes representation pater-nalistic relationship employees employers , tool emancipation basis welfare state.To define character new living spaces , Mod-ern architects deployed two apparently opposite spatial strategies.The first strategy revolved around Taylorism , implementation design process . Notable exam-ples Le Corbusier ’ Ville Radieuse1 ( 1935 ) , Alexan-der Klein ’ studies dwelling layout ( 1934 ) , 1 Image : http : //www.fonda tionl ecorb usier .fr/corbu cache /900x7 20_2049_1975.jpg.Page 3 8Spanedda Fusaro City Territ Archit ( 2020 ) 7:19 Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky ’ Frankfurt Kitchen2 ( 1926 ) , respectively scale city , building , room furniture . translate Tay-loristic sequence analysis , functional separation , optimisation design cities dwellings . whole city , house , rooms , take organisation factory . demarcation function clear without overlap , paths cross , aisles corridors reduced minimum.These proposals provide sharply defined , meticulous , beautiful line drawings analyti-cal tools ways communicate findings . graphical apparatus shows reductionist approach Taylorism leaked design process housing become organisational model life fam-ily occupying it.Dwellings became thus one ways Tay-lorism spread factories become pervasive organisational model every part society , limited factories workers office employees.The second strategy promoted flexibility , concept actually underpins two different design strands.The first strand ideologically exploits technological innovation structural concrete , conceiving dwellings stacking free floors , spatial arrangement simi-lar factory buildings turning housing , therefore city , extended factory . clear example 1914 Le Corbusier ’ Maison Dom-ino3 ( Aureli 2014 , p. 30 ) , radical image suggested stand-ardised grid floors pillars balanced allowing owners freely configure facades.The strand invokes flexibility antidote standardisation spreading outside factory . text Woman creator , Bruno Taut firmly expresses contrariety drawing floor plans “ living room meant living , sleeping cabins sleeping—and nothing else… Rather man-ner engineer regards standard family three children undertaking con-structing machines factory ” ( Taut 1924 ) . opposition , Taut states families follow organisational model , creative outcome work housewives , whose constant effort deals specific conditions . Therefore , allow fam-ily freely organise life , dwelling needs rooms different size , whose function relationship decided occupants . Taut ’ work explicitly criticises determinism Tayloristic approach , even attempts improve housewife ’ life imposing organisation model , like case Lihotzky ’ Frank-furt Kitchen.With emphasis hygiene , comfort , privacy , authonomy , eventually consumption , modern-ist idea dwelling became pervasive currently literature , especially West , overlook con-coction work family life domestic space long time Industrialism , com-mixture kept rural areas recent times . Also , worth remember 90 % dwellings world single-family type ( Oliver 2003 ) . Thus , separation functions , spaces , even family members something taken granted . According Meloni ( 2014 ) , home boundaries porous nature : establish connec-tions external world different times , opening views onto landscape , collecting memo-ries inhabitants , accommodating friends sometimes strangers . potential comes fore digital age , houses become hubs networked life ( Miller 2008 ) .Back home : age cognitive economyIn 1990s information technology began heav-ily contribute industry ’ productivity increases . time , rise knowledge economy cognitive capitalism different forms established break industrial tradition . production value moved actual products immaterial , abstract activities data gathering , organisation informa-tion , decision-making , finally control.Although elaboration knowledge collec-tion control data accompanied industrial capital-ism beginnings , two main factors boosted significantly . one hand , spreading IC tech-nologies computers , universal machines rapidly became constitutive parts production process , ubiquitous networks operate globally real time ( Schmiede 2006 ; Rasmussen Corbett 2008 ) . end , diffuse intellectu-ally , mass education , high level training produced welfare state late post-war time ( Ver-cellone Lucarelli 2013 ) .Hence various definitions informational capital-ism ( Castells 1996 ) vectorialism ( Wark 2004 ) .At time , factories shut Europe US since late 1960s 1970s , ( Florida 2005 ) showing industrial capitalism losing economic power , new form production , strictly con-nected technological progress , gaining traction : Innovation Industry ( Moretti 2014 ) .2 Image : https : //commo ns.wikim edia.org/wiki/File : Frank furte rkuec he.jpg.3 Image : http : //www.fonda tionl ecorb usier .fr/corbu cache /900x7 20_2049_1513.jpg.Page 4 8Spanedda Fusaro City Territ Archit ( 2020 ) 7:19 Among main consequences dematerialisation production , loss importance material capi-tal form factories , buildings , large equipment , acknowledgment increasing value intel-lectual capital company , embodied human beings relational , emotional cognitive faculties.Along distinctive features , IC technologies amplify Harvey ( 1989 ) calls time–space compres-sion : condition postmodernity revolutionising objective qualities time space resulting condensation elimination spatial temporal dis-tances—similar Wark ’ ( 2004 p. 154 ) thelestesia.Time–space compression thus annihilates also boundaries work , life , leisure perme-ate modern cities houses . Wark ( 2015 ) , therefore , argues radical alteration parameters space time affect production , also workers ’ way life.While industrial capitalism considered house safe clean shelter clear functions distributed space time accordance new organisa-tional doctrines , cognitive capitalism , thanks higher level abstraction inherent fluidity , offers mul-tiple interpretations interactions working dwelling.Instead producing new typologies , builds housing types inherited previous times , adapt-ing pervasive digitalisation new types labour ways life.Although consequences change wide-spread evident , still little literature , even less architectural concepts.In spite , clues start investi-gating architectural consequences cultural change , new forms organisation necessarily influ-ence city spaces ( Cacciari 2004 ) . According Bernardo Secchi ( 2013 ) , every occurrence shift relationship capital labor city suf-fered urban crisis , changing , showing resil-ience adaptation.Since new form production depends intel-lectual qualities workers , quality firm ’ material capital , like buildings hardware becomes less important , therefore localisation space . Thus , relationship workers , workplaces homes changes . Moreover , progressive digitalisation offers new opportunities commodification . rental market , traditionally limited local customers , becomes accessible customers around world , accessible almost everywhere reasonable price thanks low-cost flights.The change unfolds along several major trends : return integration house workplace , similarly pre-modern era , called SoHo ( Small office/Home office ) ; use housing benefits attract new employees dampen intrinsic precar-ity new low-term jobs , feebly echoing pater-nalism industrial capitalism ; transformation housing palatable commodity , spite localisation , finds worldwide market thanks digi-tal economy ; swapping public private sphere interior exterior house.Living rooms/working roomsInformation communication technologies played key role transformation production ulti-mately labour.The abstract , virtualised new production require proximity space time anymore . Instead , employees gradually turning digital nomads , able work “ anytime anywhere ” ( Roberlski , Keller , Harth , Mache 2019 ) . opportunity offered creative freelancers traveling across world , greater crowd white collars , work home telecommuting thanks massive pres-ence ICT domestic environment . so-called telework , defined 2002 European Social Partners , defined transposition traditional way working virtual sphere , especially practiced categories workers operating different place company . Smart work , alternative working method traditional office work also based telework-ing , allows people decide carry duties , beginning choice space , time , programs tools.This modus operandi also fits perfectly needs new generations workers entering labor market , so-called digital natives . Although digital natives able work wherever Wi-Fi connection available , especially places network , like co-working spaces , house rapidly becoming , least social groups , place fully equipped ITC.In spite , difference remains working home working home . Regus , leading com-pany flexible workspaces world , conducted study emergence smart working . sample respondents highlighted problems requests attention family members , slow unreliable Internet connection , difficulties accessing main office equipment , presence background noise rep-resented family animals , presence domestic noises.On hand , although part work done non-obtrusive way exchanging emails files , video calls , remote conferences , receiving Page 5 8Spanedda Fusaro City Territ Archit ( 2020 ) 7:19 clients conflicts intimacy domestic space , still mainly built accordance doctrine functional separation advocated design culture industrial capitalism.Potentially , return work inside space house jump back towards pre-modern schemes . However , different nature dematerialised work , affirmation new typologies indus-trial era , suggest different forms juxtaposition family life work.Two different trends emerge scarce examples buildings purposely designed around theme.At one end spectrum Jian Wai Soho quar-ter4 designed Riken Yamamoto & Field Shop Beijing ( 2004 ) . spatial concept envisions cluster tow-ers , whose apartments feature SoHo area private part house hallways , freely accessible configured pedestrian public space . resulting space combination mall , given public character passages shop windows SoHo rooms , apartment tower made rather usual dwellings , whose rooms dedicated tradi-tional functions . Work family life over-lap , simply juxtapose order coexist interfere less possible , formulating pragmatic , groundbreaking , proposal mixed typology.At opposite end spectrum Pitt Studio5 Graft Architects ( 1998 ) , space intended accom-modate “ hybrid lifestyle ” “ living working take place space ” , according design-ers . design concept features wide surface without functional subdivision , defined enclosure . Activities inside apparently blank space enabled central core , scripted wall ( obvious refer-ence profession owner , renowned actor ) whose cladding unfolds , rotates slides sideways morph table , seats , lights niches.Although meticulous design every part relationship could resemble analyti-cal attitude Klein ’ drawing , expectation build spaces defined functions , even temporarily . movable elements , possible combi-nation , activate separate , different activities , like table used eating working . Instead working juxtaposition , Graft ’ spatial experiment interprets inherent fluidity openness new way production , offering stage multiplicity situations.These two examples show two possible ways bring together life work roof . However , mostly address needs freelancers crea-tives , part knowledge workers.At time writing , tele-working receiving mas-sive boost due mobility limitations imposed sanitary policies Coronavirus pandemic throughout world . advantages shortcom-ings white-collar work home amplified , since homes became offices , schools , malls . Whole families busy , —or queuing for—remote activities . Undoubtedly based tools deployed cognitive capitalism , particular condition depending Coronavirus outbreak change means production . , however , increasing trend allowing employees keep working home ( Dwoskin 2020 ) , adducing reasons oscillate care workers ’ satisfaction savings relo-cations . However , pandemic peculiar case subject different paper within research.Home benefitThe delocalisation production different places many consequences able work home . stated Moretti ( 2014 ) , industrial capi-talism , location factories determined geo-graphical distribution workforce . Similarly today , location innovative companies attracts workforce advanced countries ( Morrill Sommers 2005 ) , human capital populates key areas high content creativity . Moreover , material production , also immaterial one relocated either places major concentration innovative skilled workers , workforce cheaper overall conditions economically rewarding employer.Housing , therefore , gains new role one ben-efits make position attractive : addition material value , house also attains potential value.This happens levels recruitment : house car often fringe benefits supplementing top posi-tion , lodging could also added extra workers lower wages.As example , customer service companies relocate offices specific areas world , conse-quently also look workers capable complying qualitative standards . matter fact , many call centres operate nation user calls , parts world kinds services mostly concentrated . Nonetheless , operators answering telephone , chat email , able interact perfectly customers ’ language . consequence , companies often recruit workers 4 Image : http : //www.riken -yamam oto.co.jp/cnc_manag er/file/proje ct/soho0 2.jpg.5 Image : https : //graft lab.com/portf olio_page/pitt-studi o/.Page 6 8Spanedda Fusaro City Territ Archit ( 2020 ) 7:19 country service delivered , provid-ing employment contract includes benefits perks including also house shared col-leagues . Although houses seem subject design research , , great poten-tial architectural investigation , bordering risk becoming gated communities one side , 21st cen-tury editions factory houses workers side . Without falling reductionist trap perfect bubble knowledge workers , design investigate whether community could really built around working environment artificially implanted foreign context , activities put common , viable opportunity combine life work together , , , community spa-tially relate surroundings.Hosts guestsThe American company Airbnb started 2008 online platform rent empty rooms inside house-holds . Like many success stories sharing economy , Airbnb established another way working . Airbnb host quickly became full-time occu-pation many homeowners touristic locations , often alternative unemployment declining liberal professions.After slashing success digital product , company raised ambitions : 2016 , fact , Airbnb announced birth Samara , division tasked designing building architecture.Backyard ( Samara 2018 ) first initiative Samara . aims investigating home designed built sharing look feel . According com-pany , prototypes investigate potential space facets . Backyard put several timely questions . key points project concern new construction techniques , use ecological materi-als reduced environmental impact , reduction construction waste , use smart home technologies , self-sufficiency , need cohabitation . Samara ’ first work direction prototype house pre-sented House Vision 2 exhibition held Tokyo directed designer Kenya Hara ; collaboration Samara japanese archi-tect Go Hasegawa , Airbnb proposed Yoshino Cedar House,6 ( Gebbia Hasegawa 2016 ) housing model involves use local materials , communal space ground floor , cooperative hosting group local residents.Looking first built Samara ’ house pictures architectural models Backyard ’ site , whole exploration seems oriented towards flexible dynamic home models trying conjugate global hospi-tality genius loci.More promising , still limited achieve-ments , interest Samara ’ work lies reasons . fact , according Airbnb , idea establishing design company surfaced realised many company ’ hosts felt need modifying homes meet guests ’ expectations . means economic pressure exerted short-term rentals much far reaching expected . Firstly , produce sudden change roles : sharing pri-vate space , house owners lose status acquire rights guests , turning roommates . Secondly , short-term rentals modify urban occupation patterns , land value , availability , price long-term rentals , neighbouring economic activi-ties ( Gurran Phibbs 2017 ; Picascia et al . 2017 ) .Finally , motivation behind Samara reveals change propagating architectural level , sneaky process adaptation spaces new activities.Whether hosting Airbnb another way earning owning apartment , way enrich lives city overcoming equation stran-ger = danger ( Gebbia 2016 ) offer hospitality next room , entity transformation taking place body cities inside buildings becom-ing quite relevant . Therefore , critical revision changes induced sharing economy spatial structure house city deserves collec-tive discussion led main eco-nomic player involved it.Private goes publicBetween 1960s 1970s , sociologists highlighted loss meaning importance public space induced socio-cultural transformations ways life changes . According Habermas ( 1962 ) , public sphere embraces three dimensions : ephemeral sphere , physically staged dimension , abstract sphere , built combination mass-media delo-calised audience . Sennett ( 2017 ) attributes responsi-bilities transforming concept public space economic policies . transformation public space results gradual loss traction , people increas-ingly retreat within private domain , meantime experiencing unprecedented evolution . fact , trend gains momentum due increasing role ICT technologies expanding availability media content , thus powering abstract sphere affecting different areas everyday life.6 Images : https : //www.yoshi noced arhou se.com/the-desig n.Page 7 8Spanedda Fusaro City Territ Archit ( 2020 ) 7:19 Furthermore , expansion digital services relocate within living rooms bedrooms great amount fundamental services person , activi-ties usually take part public spaces : banking , food , shopping . shift makes public space poten-tially irrelevant ( Harvey 2006 ) .Advancements technology transformed living rooms place exchange , encounter confrontation , absorbing character town square demate-rialised way.An emblematic case sociological phenomenon Second Screen : sitting domestic privacy , people time spectators happens outside house , capable interaction events social media.The home private space anymore , integrated space aiming reconciling every component contemporary life , old ones new ones arising ICT paradigm.ConclusionsThe aim paper provide overview implications housing design due shift industrial cognitive capitalism.The second industrial revolution sparked great change housing design . Modernist legacy made great amount typological studies great interest . show reductionist approach architec-tural design , deeply influenced managerial cul-ture industrial production based optimisation , definition functions separations . spite strong connection time , swift changes later occurred economy society , modern housing typologies still widespread today.However , change cognitive economy related forms capitalism swept away linear think-ing industrialism . Networking , real time calculations , telecommunications , allowed complexity re-emerge everyday life , disrupting trust spatial dis-tribution time schedules industrial capitalism , also possibility reorganising deter-ministic terms.Completely new ways working living , like home working , guest hosting , media production laid spaces designed separation , pri-vacy , different functions mind . hand , use housing benefit working contracts reminiscent old paternalistic attitude industri-alism , without grand aspiration produce new housing models . Moreover , like urban space lost part public character , housing lost connotation privacy intimacy . Houses places open countless digital encounters confrontations , expanding urban world urban dimension.The question arises , , notion typology still useful spite changes , burgeon-ing digital environment getting rid classification based spatial patterns , whole concept spatial organisation.The examples mentioned paper , though , show spatial organisation still issue , space yet field discussion . idea typology formally based spatial taxonomy probably showing limits , ways ground typological dis-course could prove highly useful present time.Drawing Lévi Strauss ( 1962 ) , Martí Arís ( 1993 ) radically disconnects typology history , two com-plementing parts discourse architecture . history focuses transformations , typology investigates permanence . thus inextricable , histori-cal change brings essence object fore , essence becomes cluster potentialities available development . Arís ’ typology twofold , concerns existing architectural space also unveils future potential.From phenomenological point view , Gregotti ( 1972 ) formulates definition typology based spa-tial relationships form . classification locates every architectural organism within field pos-sibilities depending , one side , tightness relationships internal components ( autonomy ) , side , quality connections context ( ability establishing relationships different levels ) .Arís ’ epistemological investigations Gregotti ’ operative framework two different examples typology still overcome reductionist approach maintain role designer ’ tool.There still great field explore , critical approach housing design.The juxtaposition typologies functions , pos-sibility thinking dwellings sum functions spaces activated users—like Modern-ist experiences already suggested , inner flexibility requested sharing economy , design strategies implant corporate housing inside urban areas , finally concept housing one multiple intersections physical digital space , design challenges bring complexity back work-ing material.Architecture probably able answer deep social questions raised cognitive capitalism , like Engels believe urban science could con-tribute solve social problems related Great Industry.Page 8 8Spanedda Fusaro City Territ Archit ( 2020 ) 7:19 could however try advance proposals organisation , connections , juxtapositions modifica-tion space time , hinge physical digital , scales , starting indispensable relationship city house , changes propagate one term other.Dealing challenges thrown cognitive econ-omy , contemporary architecture deal task providing new physical systems relationship spheres dwelling work , lei-sure entertainment.AcknowledgementsNot applicable.Authors ’ contributionsThe whole text result shared effort authors . authors read approved final manuscript.FundingThis work supported “ Fondo di Ateneo per la ricerca 2019 ” , University Sassari .
