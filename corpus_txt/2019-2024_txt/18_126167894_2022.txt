Scrabble , players use tiles containing single letters make words . instance , player use tiles , C R con-struct words CAR ARC . analogy , words like products letters like capabilities , modules em-bedded knowledge . assume player plenty copies letters . means country certain module knowledge , use knowledge many different settings . challenge measure number different letters players looking two things : first , number words player write ; second , number players write particular word . Players letters able make words . expect diversity words ( products ) Athat players ( countries ) make strongly related number letters ( capabilities ) . Hence , diversity first measure much knowledge country . Let us look words . number players make word indicative many letters word . Longer words tend less common , since put together players requisite letters . Similarly , complex products less com-mon countries requisite knowledge able make . Products require little knowledge ubiquitous vice versa . diversity country ’ exports crude approxima-tion variety capabilities available country , ubiquity product crude approximation variety capabilities required product . Consider medical imaging devices . machines made places , countries able make , United States Germany , also export large num-ber products . infer medical imaging devices complex countries make tend diverse . consider case raw diamonds . products extracted places , making ubiquity quite low . re-flection high knowledge-intensity raw diamonds ? ! raw diamonds complex , countries extract diamonds also able make many things would many capabilities required diamonds . see though Sierra Leone Botswana principally export diamonds . indicates , unlike medical imaging devices , something large volumes knowledge makes diamonds rare . measures affected existence rare capabilities , , using Scrabble analogy , would represented letters like Q X . , used diversity countries making product ( say , diamonds ) nuance first impression given ( low ) ubiquity product .
