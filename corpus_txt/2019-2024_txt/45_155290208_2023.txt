Fosu ( 1996 ) also supports ELG hypothesis selected African countries using OLS regression technique 1960–1980 period . Kugler ( 1991 ) found positive effects exports economic growth group industrialized countries using time-series econometric analysis , without strong long-run relationships . time , Tang , Lai , Ozturk ( 2015 ) found long-run relationship exports GDP case Four Asian Little Dragon economies . China India also countries achieved rapid economic growth increasing export activities internationalizing economies ( Khan , Wazir , & Akhtar , 2019 ) , Stiglitz ( 2007 ) found globalization trade significant positive impact economic growth almost countries . Dritsakis ( 2004 ) analyzed relationship exports , investments , economic development Bulgaria Romania found positive strong causal relation exports economic growth.However , export-dependent countries vulnerable severely affected global economic crisis 2007/08 , raising questions sustainability export-led growth policies countries . time , group papers tried show export structure rather export volume important determinant economic growth . studies focus export complexity export sophistication main drivers long-run economic growth.Hausmann , Hwang , Rodrik ( 2007 ) confirmed strong positive relationship level GDP per capita export sophistication using panel techniques 113 countries 1992–2003 period . research shown structure exports exhibits strong predictive power future economic growth . Hausmann Klinger ( 2006 ) explored export structure potential economy implementing structural changes aimed increasing export sophistication . group 106 countries , showed statistically significant relationship export structure country 46Darko Lazarov Goce Petreski Export Complexity Economic Growth : Empirical Analysis Selected CEE CountriesCroatian Economic Survey : Vol . 25 : . 2 : December 2023 : pp . 41-65and export sophistication growth , measured growth EXPY index . estimated results research indicate countries export wide range sophisticated products greater capacity implement structural transformation accelerate long-term economic growth . Hesse ( 2008 ) examined relationship exports concentration economic growth using dynamic panel model ( GMM regression method ) group 99 countries ( excluding Eastern European countries oil-exporting countries ) long period time ( 1961–2000 ) . results shown developing countries greater export concentration exhibited higher economic performance dynamic economic growth , , time , shown relationship non-linear . However , empirical study attempt explore mechanisms export concentration affects economic growth per capita ( whether due deterioration terms trade countries exporting natural resource-based products something else ) . Hausmann et al . ( 2007 ) tried explain main transmission mechanism export sophistication economic growth using costs new product discovery entrepreneurs . Indeed , entrepreneurs countries considerable production capabilities complementary inputs lower fixed costs comes building comparative advantages production new products expanding existing export basket , opposed countries limited production knowledge short supply chain stuck process structural transformation . McCann ( 2007 ) examined composition exports economic growth . research drawn attention exports structure rather value exports determinant economic growth . author performed detailed decomposition exports structure , classified high low technology-intensive industries sectors , examined structure exports level export complexity country sample . econometric results 47Darko Lazarov Goce Petreski Export Complexity Economic Growth : Empirical Analysis Selected CEE CountriesCroatian Economic Survey : Vol . 25 : . 2 : December 2023 : pp . 41-65using panel method random effects sample 117 countries , 1980–2003 period , show positive statistically significant correlation export sophistication economic growth . addition , Hidalgo , Klinger , Barabási , Hausmann ( 2007 ) empirically tested hypothesis countries higher level export sophistication greater opportunities diversify exports countries limited possibility extend export basket , result shorter list accumulated capabilities.Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) tried explain mechanism structure exports ( country 's position product space ) economic growth applying network theory . provided useful framework analytical approach analyzing export sophistication complexity country , well cost creating new adopting existing capabilities ( human physical capital , institutions , infrastructure , organizational business practices ) needed expansion number existing export products . results empirical analysis support thesis economic complexity ( country 's ability produce export products higher level productivity ) fundamental factor long-term economic growth.Jarreau Poncet ( 2012 ) empirically investigated export sophistication economic growth individual Chinese provinces using panel techniques ( Fixed Random effects GMM method ) 1997–2007 period . Supplementary , survey decomposed export sophistication domestic foreign firms , whereby results shown relationship export sophistication economic growth conditioned level income provinces , market conditions , presence foreign direct investments.Felipe , Kumar , Abdon ( 2010 ) developed Index Opportunities 130 countries based capabilities transform economic export structure . found Asian countries simultaneously 48Darko Lazarov Goce Petreski Export Complexity Economic Growth : Empirical Analysis Selected CEE CountriesCroatian Economic Survey : Vol . 25 : . 2 : December 2023 : pp . 41-65invested improving production capabilities achieved successful results diversifying export structures improving level export sophistication , important steps accelerating economic growth long run . According study , extreme , another group countries , mainly Africa , scored low Index Opportunities production capabilities sufficient transform economies change export structures towards sophisticated diversified products . Therefore , authors suggested countries create economic policies focusing stimulating investments new production capabilities way speeding structural transformation process economic growth.Felipe , Kumar , Abdon , Bacate ( 2012 ) studied product complexity economic development using database based 5.107 products 124 countries according Hidalgo Hausmann ’ ( 2009 ) method reflections compute measures countries ’ export complexity , well product space model ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) , based BACI database ( Gaulier & Zignago , 2008 ) . paper found positive relationship export complexity level economic development.Abdon Felipe ( 2011 ) analyzed structural transformation process economic development Sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) , attempting examine export structure analyzed countries identify opportunities export diversification economic growth . found much Sub-Saharan Africa ’ export structure based unsophisticated highly standard products poorly linked product space , making process structural transformation region particularly difficult.There recent studies analyze link export complexity economic growth using Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) measure level complexity products exported countries . Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) also used technique predict explain 49Darko Lazarov Goce Petreski Export Complexity Economic Growth : Empirical Analysis Selected CEE CountriesCroatian Economic Survey : Vol . 25 : . 2 : December 2023 : pp . 41-65economic trajectories countries , cities , regions ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) new approaches measuring level export sophistication ( Lall , Weiss , & Zhang , 2006 ) . However , Koch ( 2021 ) provided new empirical approach approximates economic complexity based country ’ value-added export structure , led significantly different complexity rankings higher explanatory power GDP per capita growth rates compared established metrics . new approach , measures domestic foreign component countries ’ export complexity , builds previous studies tried capture share foreign value added export structure . especially important take consideration fact process globalization FDI inflows initiate increasing trend foreign value-added share countries ’ export , could lead erroneous conclusions analyzing relationship export , complexity , economic growth ( Koopman , Wang , & Wei , 2014 ; Timmer , Miroudot , & de Vries , 2019 ) . case even examining link export economic performance . Finally , Shahzad , Madaleno , Dagar , Ghosh , Doğan ( 2022 ) investigated influence export product quality economic complexity economic growth 28 OECD countries using data 1990 2019 found positive significant impact export quality growth long run.The paper contributes existing literature export sophistication economic growth previous study tested hypothesis export sophistication robust impact economic growth sample CEE countries using dynamic panel regression analysis ( system GMM ) .3 Data Model main objective section analyze export structure level export sophistication 21 selected CEE countries answer question whether export sophistication robust impact economic growth 50Darko Lazarov Goce Petreski Export Complexity Economic Growth : Empirical Analysis Selected CEE CountriesCroatian Economic Survey : Vol . 25 : . 2 : December 2023 : pp . 41-65these countries . purpose analysis , export complexity index ( EXPY ) , measures added value technology intensity products part countries ’ export structure , used.A country ’ export complexity determined level sophistication products produces exports comparative advantages .
