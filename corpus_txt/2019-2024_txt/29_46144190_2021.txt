INTRODUCTION growing interest studying pathways knowledge relatedness diversification many areas society . Examples range countries , institutions , cities ( Hidalgo C. A. , 2021 ) acquire know-how develop new industrial capabilities , also individuals learn new occupations . Past works used data network science methods map relatedness activities agents develop . signals successful approach describing natural tendency economies , regions , institutions , individuals diversify . Furthermore , said productive structure given country strongly determines future economic growth , diversification lastly income inequality ( Dominik , Mayra , & L. Pinheiro , 2019 ; Hidalgo , et al. , 2017 ) . Economic developments interconnected ways countries likely develop new economic activities similar ones already in-house ( Hidalgo , et al. , 2017 ) . Adam Smith , people organizations diversify activities , economic growth also increases giving sense two correlated , words , number individual activities complexity emerges relationships directly correlated development one ’ economy ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2009 ) . argue public service demand major source innovation lot potential improve service delivery generate synergies benefits associated spillovers . ( Edler & Georghiou , 2007 ) Previous studies concluded time public procurement triggered innovation waves , surpassing R & initiatives procurement create new pioneer markets innovation-intensive services ( Kok & al. , 2004 ) . Furthermore innovation dynamics mostly depend scale characteristics demand determinant competitiveness given location ( Edler & Georghiou , 2007 ) . rationale public procurement trigger innovation seen different levels . represents domestic demand fosters innovation prime source enhancing local enterprises competitiveness , lastly potential improve public infrastructures public services broader sense ( Edler & Georghiou , 2007 ) .This infatuates idea supply chains private organizations service offerings work closely public institutions benefit ones country , region municipality procures , create spill overs global markets benefits economic agents ( Edler & Georghiou , 2007 ) . 2 Public administration entities operate specific non-competitive conditions ( e.g . water , energy , public transportation even postal services ) use procurements purchase services goods . procurements medium/high range price must granted concurrent procedures defined Portuguese national laws , except specific cases . August 2017 , Portuguese law ( Decreto-Lei n. º 111-B/2017 ) republished accommodate changes current regulation Public Contracts code ( CCP ) . ‘ Portal BASE ’ , centralizes information regarding public contracts , management responsibility IMPIC provides important information execution public contracts subject CCP . information found datasets , related services offered Portuguese private companies public sector . also provides information published announcements related need creating public contracts , contracts subjected parts II III CCP , include accurate complete disclosure goods , services work carried contract lifecycle , overall price , contractor ’ name , remaining competitors contract identified challenges . datasets guarantee free procurement market extent allow citizens supervise private companies politicians actions public money expenditure ( Rodríguez , Montequín , Fernández , & Balsera , 2019 ) . type government procedures inside concurrent procedures varies many ways performing business private organizations . One commonly used Portugal known open call dictates anyone present complete proposal win public tenders . Normally , law mandates procuring authority issues public tenders value procurement exceeds certain threshold . Portugal , government procurement directed “ Código dos Contratos Públicos ” Public Contracts Code ( PCC ) . extract process data available BASE portal covers services sold private companies public sector Portugal analyze relatedness services , encoded CPV companies sell/perform . ’ use datasets best proxy hinging fact activities public sector considerable weight Portuguese Economy . 3 proposal develop view development economic growth using network science methods infer Portuguese private companies relate service portfolio , analyses traded services network entities bound offered services network characterization . 4 II . LITERATURE REVIEW work focus attention Portuguese public procurement market , particular service providers offerings public sector . use available data proxy activity private companies explore relatedness services provided condition ability relate portfolio services . 1 . PORTUGAL PUBLIC PROCUREMENT Governments around world purchase goods services order fulfill needs strategic initiatives . Government expenditure ’ grew enormously per results spending areas like social protection , education healthcare . tendency noticeable high-income countries ( Ortiz-Ospina & Roser , 2019 ) deeply rely private sector order produce services goods public sector develop . procure private company ’ services govern city country ’ activities maintenance functioning public infrastructures . ( Curado , Damásio , Encarnação , Candia , & L. Pinheiro , 2021 ) EU region governments operate economic , social sometimes political space unpredictable complex environments ( OECD space ) .Public contracting represents large volume spending governments , average 12 % GDP OECD countries . ( OECD , 2019 ) play major role directly binding country economic strategy inspire efficiency public trust ( OECD , 2019 ) Despite subject importance , public procurement relatively under-researched area . analyze data private organizations perspective becomes upmost relevance order understand public Portuguese market evolves . Portugal one EU state members registering higher increase public expenditure compared percentage GDP , 1995 2011 . ( OECD , 2019 ) 2011 onwards , continues register even higher values areas like defense public safety , health , education social protection converging medium functional structure EU region . allowed significant improvements areas health ( Braz & Cunha , 2012 ) curious fact , late September 2018 , Portugal registered budgetary surplus 1111 M€ , equivalent 0.7 % GDP generated period . year 2016 almost 20 % total government expenditure channeled procurement , represents 9 , 01 % national income . ( Braz & Cunha , 2012 ) 5 discussing public procurement different forms purchase arise , include tendering contracting build large infrastructural projects , goes beyond infrastructure , including purchase office supplies , procurement information technology services , social transfers others . Portugal , total expenditure government outsourcing 7.5 % national income 2016 ( Ortiz-Ospina & Roser , 2019 ) . OECD defines set recommendations applied European countries promote modernizing procurement systems use procurements life cycle interconnected elements strategic governance increase integrity contracts . directives require public tenders certain contractual limits must available beforehand ( Mateus , Ferreira , & Carreira. , 2010 ) duly published countries official journals . Electronic Public Procurement Index Portugal ( ICPEP ) developed control percentage rate public procurement procedures registered – part Manchester commitment -through duly authorized electronic platforms . total values 2018 approximately 82 % ( IMPIC , 2020 ) also reflects carrying direct award procedures electronic platform mandatory action ( Roriz & Ministro , 2016 ) . base portal - http : //www.base.gov.pt/ - created purpose centralizing Portuguese public procurement data , public procurement related laws lastly disclose public information subjects . site must keep date information regarding formation execution Portuguese public contracts , thus allowing tracking monitoring ( IMPIC , BASE contractos públicos online , s.d. ) . data comprises information related final contract value , contracting contracted/s entities , execution site , applicants , duration , closing date , CPV among others . 6 Figure 1 | Yearly Contract amount distribution ( € ) observe yearly contract amount variation note descending tendency 2011 , 2012 2018.This possible explained austerity measures imposed periods invariable led less procurement contracts . Figure 1 , shows distribution total amount public contracts reported 2008-2020 ( retrieved data 21th November 2019 5th April 2021 ( year 2019 2020 ) , validates overall public procurement spending increased - almost doubling value 2013 2019- , minor setbacks years 2012 2018 . raw data analyzed accounts total sum 109721 uniquely identified entities 9 % relate foreign unidentified entities . number contract occurrences range 1 1043 average 2.33 contracts held , could seen narrow distribution contracts service space . 1,048,576 total electronical reported contracts denote contracts distribution somehow ambiguous , due duplications . Different regions report contract price values , happens shared contracts several public institutions also registered . 2 . NETWORK SCIENCE Major organizations like Google , Facebook Twitter use network analysis base technology business model . Examples range mapping world ’ social network 7 human genome project completed 2001 result offered list human genes mappings/interactions protein , metabolites cellular components , creating molecular network ( Barabási , 2016 ) Perhaps , surprisingly , network analysis today interdisciplinary field many mature methodologies applications diversified areas provide common framework study network systems analyze implications unfolding dynamical processes govern . Network science roots graph theory appeal empirical studies focus data , distinguished . Network science provide us common methodology study important networks one particular upmost interest thesis , product space ( Barabási , 2016 ) . papers developed Hidalgo drowned structures critical understand national wide economic development , embodied services one country ’ provide constraint ease transforming one ’ economy . seminal work Hidalgo et al ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) proposed product space network inspired subject thesis use network analysis methodology . representation different products related one another suggests notion proximity distance . instance , oranges lemons identical , compared oranges copper wires . ( Correia da Cunha & Braz , 2012 ) structural perspective relevant occupations urban economies try showcase alike product space network , Portuguese service space also shares behavioral characteristics evolvement , creating new sense evolution Portuguese region . Product Space ( Hidalgo , Klinger , Barabási , & Hausmann , 2007 ) network connects products terms necessary knowledge skills needed produce demonstrates probability country export product – node , representing activity network - increases number related services/products already present country/area . builds network binds products stronger connections - measured using density weighted average related activities . Hence , distant products less similar weaker bonds . network helped understand even predict countries undergo economic growth others remain lower income provides data visualizations exportations performed given country . 8 Likewise considered approach uses outcome-based measures relate two services , advocates activities similar require level knowledge , technology , physical factors sort combination , based conditional probability service b positive Revealed Comparative Advantage ( RCA ) . key objective master thesis understand services offered Portuguese private companies related self ’ defy relatedness principle . Service related contracts include activities provision consultancy , training even cleaning services . ( Curado , Damásio , Encarnação , Candia , & L. Pinheiro , 2021 ) differences found comparing products services , instance , products tend fill customers need service points build relationship trust normally offer multiple formulations . Unlike products , services known intangible – physical presence ( Kotler , 1983 ) - touched although share similar attributes studied compared , hence , services studied symmetric way correlation products . 3 . NETWORK RELATED ACTIVITIES principle relatedness signals path undiscovered area ( Hidalgo , Klinger , Barabási , & Hausmann , 2007 ) . says relation exists two activities ( e.g . products , industries , research areas ) whenever require similar knowledge inputs ( Hidalgo , Klinger , Barabási , & Hausmann , 2007 ) .Some specific factors describe relatedness pair services , hence likely produced tandem . Analogously , un-related services less likely co-produced . Furthermore , relatedness economic structures knowledge highly determine future path industrial , technological occupational diversification ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) , organizations tendency move activities share similar knowledge productive capabilities . certain extent , opposite also affirmed , , ’ hard diversify service portfolio unrelated activities . ( Frenken & Boschma , 2007 ) . principle beneath confirms economy produces cotton probably find much easier add portfolio production textiles rather robots un-related activity . ( Hartmann , Bezerra , & L. Pinheiro , 2019 ) Therefore access proximity two services shared knowledge analysis probability offered contracted entity . Formally , 9 proximity services ’ minimum conditional probability private organization Revealed Comparative Advantage ( RCA ) services . term Revealed Comparative Advantage ( RCA ) refers economic index calculates whether given country advantage disadvantage worldwide trade flows , certain area commodity . countries choose export house products things lack . simple example given using humble product , bananas . Countries like Ecuador Hawaii detain comparative advantage long list countries good . Similarly use methodology validate level relatedness services provided private companies inside Portuguese public market . Using symmetry theory , define service complexity index services ( ) previous definitions . say Portuguese contracted entity Revealed Comparative Advantage > 1 given service considered effective producer service . contrary also applied . use index validate private contracted entity comparative advantage operating companies Portuguese market ( i.e . services private organization offers based overall services provided Portugal ) . compute proximity , organize service data using specialization matrices ( 𝑋𝑐𝑠 ) summarize contract values ( Euros ) company c service s. ( e.g . medical tools , construction works denoted subscript ) . Revealed Comparative Advantage ( 𝑅𝑐𝑠 ) relates companies relevant offered services ( i.e . services sell based Portuguese total market share ) . RCA formula defined following : 𝑅𝑐𝑠 = 𝐸𝑐𝑠 ∑ 𝑠′′∈𝑆𝐸𝑐𝑠′⁄∑ 𝑐′ ∈ 𝐶𝐸𝑐′𝑠 ∑ 𝑐′ ∈ 𝐶 , 𝑠′ ∈ 𝑆𝐸𝑐′𝑠′ ⁄ ( 1 ) , index equal contracted entity offer certain service , 𝐸𝑐𝑠∑ 𝑐′∈𝐶𝐸𝑐′𝑠 divided proportion entire space ( Portugal ) commodity∑ 𝑠′′∈𝑆𝐸𝑐𝑠′∑ 𝑐′∈𝐶 , 𝑠′∈𝑆𝐸𝑐′𝑠′ . , define 𝐸𝑐𝑠 = 1 company comparative advantage given service ( 𝑅𝑐𝑠 > 1 ) given service share total Portuguese universe expenditure positive say values 1 , defined has𝐸𝑐𝑠 = 0 . Matrix 𝐸𝑐𝑠 companies ’ relevant services . 10 ’ interesting see diversity services portfolio offered company ubiquity service number companies offering service ( 𝐾𝑠 = ∑ 𝐸𝑐𝑠𝑐 ) , revealed comparative advantage . focus proximity . proximity two services ’ ( ∅𝑠𝑠′ ) calculated minimum conditional probability company revealed comparative Advantage ( RCA ) services : ∅𝑠𝑠′ = ∑ 𝐸𝑐𝑠𝑐 𝐸𝑐𝑠′max ( 𝐾𝑠 , 𝐾𝑠′ ) ( 2 ) example , 12 contracted entities offer service x RCA > 1 , 12 , 6 also offer service RCA > 1 general offering probability – proximity – service x relation product 50 % . Resulting values referred density , 𝜔𝑐𝑠 service company c : 𝜔𝑐𝑠 = ∑ 𝐸𝑐𝑠′𝑠′ ∅𝑠𝑠′∑ ∅𝑠𝑠′𝑠′ ( 3 ) Services higher density correspond companies ’ offering similar capabilities , reverse also applied , lower density services farther proximity wise . 11 III . METHODS MATERIALS 4 . DATA INFORMATION rely available data retrieved web portal base.gov.pt , contains Portuguese public procurements years , 2008-2020 . BASE portal represents centralized instrument aggregates procurement information , regardless nature , involves Portuguese public institution third-party . results statistical information national public procurement public expenditure , particular drawing annual public reports statistical reports European Commission . Although arguably incomplete dataset , perspective entirety activities private companies offer , use proxy access public sector information Portuguese Economy . According IMPIC , portal manages information related 81.88 % ( Direção Financeira , de Estudos e de Estratégia Instituto dos Mercados Públicos , Imobiliário e da Construção , I.P. , 2020 ) public procurements registered 5 available certified electronic platforms . information available datasets include data related initial public offering ( e.g. , issue date , upload date , duration , involved institutions ) , financial info ( e.g. , contract price value ( Euros ) , final contract values ) , important information ( e.g. , tender applicants , service classification provided CPV described Common Procurement Vocabulary ) . 12 Figure 2 | Contract data Diagram , allows graphical visualisation theoretical process contracts final image . sourced data transferred two-dimensional heterogeneous tabular data structure allows easy arithmetic operations ( rows columns ) ease dataset manipulation , python . Furthermore , remove contract ’ contain essential information purpose thesis ( incorrect CPV NIF values , foreign NIF ’ , records negative , null missing contract price values ) . parse strip raw key information , like CPV ( Code description ) , duration , dates contract value remove irrelevant wording information would difficult analysis . simplify analysis , exclude contracts given nature one one ( see Figure 2 | Contract data Diagram ) contracted contracting entity , studying one-to-one company basis . resulting data includes information 1.048.576 tenders/procurement contracts ( retrieved data 21th November 2019 5th April 2021 ( year 2019 2020 ) , ranging 2008 2020 total contract amount 60 Million € ( including taxes – 60,505,772,405 ) 109721 distinct private companies . part parsing dataset correctness checks removed equivalent 1.2 % contracts . 13 Figure 3 | Yearly Contracts distribution , images show evolution total contracts registered Portuguese digital platforms grouped year . observe 2011 , 2012 2018 decrease number contracts performed . somehow explained financial crisis momentum lived period , although outside scope thesis analyze . perform deep analysis visualize central data tendencies plot histogram , containing information contract values distributed . Figure 4 , plots distribution continuous logarithm contract value observations density variation . shows majority observations values range 3 5 , following normal distribution . 14 Figure 4 | Cumulative contract value distribution visually exploit Portuguese contract values distribute . perceive follows normal distribution , meaning contracts ( > 0.7 ) average contract values . Although dataset exploited several perspectives ’ focusing CPV proximity analysis define procurement codes category level , allow us obtain optimal CPV level study evolution type supplies , works services forming subject contract private company . 15 IV . RESULTS 5 . COMMON PROCUREMENT VOCABULARY common procurement code ( CPV ) classification system allows unique subject definition used contracting contracted companies forming public procurement agreements . level detail used key ensure proper classification avoid ambiguity allows higher number bidders guaranteeing transparency . Historically , classification system based service expert judgement . analysis offer alternative structuring services based data revealed activity patterns companies . ’ expect see major mismatch data-driven representation traditional classification , former present accurate representation proximity/overlap services products , service space . CPV structure composed main vocabulary standardizes references used describe subject contracts ( 9454 terms list goods , works services broadly used procurement ) ( European Comission , 2008 ) . composed 9 characters ( 8 numbers control character ) . first two digits identify 45 divisions ( XX000000-Y ) , whereas following 6 determine classification level - composed groups , classes , categories sub-categories - ( SIMAP ) add precision ( see Table 1 | CPV description ) . ( European Comission , 2008 ) Table 1 | CPV description contains example better understand contracts typified using CPV vocabulary . shows valid code contract performed public sector subject contract would buying transport equipment ( boats ) ( European Comission , 2008 ) start removing contracts values 500 euros reduce data ambiguity noise better heighten dataset .

Level one , first two characters ; Level 2 , first three characters ) observed record represented contract first two characters ( Level one ) , properly defined ( see Figure 5 ) . Figure 5 | CPV coverage usage . CPV usage shows 100 % coverage Level 1 , means retrieved contracts two first characters properly defined subject . observe tendency diminishes level reveals increasingly poor CPV categorization , either vocabulary unfamiliarity lack CPV coverage contract subjecting . CPV usage also follows declining trend , showing 70 % CPV codes used classify contracts . level 5 see decreases significantly , possible reason given poor CPV usage found level . second iteration , performed CPV coverage analysis comparing list current CPV ’ used dataset full list CPV codes , remain mostly unchanged first three levels ( Level 1 : 74.81 % , Level 2 : 74.33 % , Level 3 : 71.52 % ) ( See Figure 5 ) , highly decreases Level 6 onwards . nutshell , better data resolution could amount reduction errors analyzing contracts hand also mean data loss , due accuracy incorrectness , lead us conclude category level ( Level 2 : first three digits ) optimal balance , ’ still able fully differentiate contracts whilst maintaining enough data analyze . 17 6 . PROCUREMENT SERVICES PROXIMITY SPACE proper CPV selection structure data using specialized matrix ( 𝑀𝑐𝑠 ) , allows individually interpret share contracted entities offered services ( E.g . retrieved data related laboratory equipment ’ average contract value 8.602.892 , 21 € ) . goal involve measure proximity different services , encoded CPV . measure proximity two services compute probability , p ( S2| S1 ) company selling service , S1 , also likely sell service , S2 . Formally , proximity services S1 S2 minimum conditional probability private organization Revealed Comparative Advantage ( RCA ) services . RCA used identify services company selling/offering , given size service market portfolio services sold institution . create service space square proximity matrix containing 316x316 entries ( Level 2 combinations ) , represent particular service pairwise diagonal values composed infinite values ( See Figure 6 ) . symmetric matrix sorted CPV code element represents pairwise proximity two services . observe many empty 0 elements belong un-relatable services ( less similar ) . Figure 6 | Cumulative RCA distribution service proximity heatmap . observe left image relevant RCA ’ ( RCA > 1 ) sparse space . right plot data visualization technique data proximity clustered service space . Represented matrix ( 316x316 ) services higher proximity values represented darker colors , shows frequency distribution proximities .

Figure 7 shows Portuguese service space visualization based proximity matrix , connecting network similar services ( ∅𝑠𝑠′ ) depicts services higher density ( 𝜔𝑐𝑠 ) values , hence relevant universe . help retrieve insights dynamics services , space contains many weak connections use minimum spanning tree ( MST ) algorithm generate network “ skeleton ” , maximizes sum proximities ( Hidalgo , Klinger , Barabási , & Hausmann , 2007 ) , show relevant links . Figure 7 | Portuguese Procurement Proximity Network ( 3PN ) highlighted 2018-2021 period relevant services ( RCA > ) 1 . node coloring corresponds one 45 Level 1 categories . close services referenced right legend . diverse visualization techniques , service space use Kamada-Kawai layout , used drawing undirected graphs ( Tomihisa & Satoru , 1989 ) . algorithm attempts position nodes Euclidean distance space short path distance . Although Kamada-Kawai slower computationally expensive large networks , ’ represent problem space . 19 definitely visualize proximity sectors , density computes distance given service related services . Relatively high density values account diversified economy - highest degree similarity hence relatedness providing capabilities companies -and key predicting probability location –Portugal - increases decreases specialization activity . overall network representation individual analysis service category allowed visually acknowledge services represented inside category level tendentiously close similar services , indicates good CPV characterization , practice . Figure 8 | RCA Specialization Diagram figure shows level RCA distribution entire Portuguese procurement proximity network ( 3PN ) denotes majority companies really diverse offer one specialized service . Network representation let us observe structure also covariates . want differentiate services better contribute higher contract values located inside network . , scale service node sizes proportionately contract values – money involved specific service category - , use logarithmic node size scaling due dispersive values contracts . , painted network using service classifications Level 1 . 20 Figure 9 | Contract valued network .

SERVICE SPACE COMMUNITY ANALYSIS Visually grouping ordinary objects categories present insights evidence informational patterns reader . ( Radicchi , Castellano , Cecconi , Loreto , & Parisi , 2004 ) network science community represents likelihood group nodes connect opposition nodes different communities , form locally densely connected sub-graphs . ( Barabási , 2016 ) . concept community common linked definitions like module , class , group , cluster , others ( Radicchi , Castellano , Cecconi , Loreto , & Parisi , 2004 ) . Modularity often considered property defined degree within cluster minus expected degree - number nodes - within clusters . forms highly dense compartments decoupled separate groups , called communities ( Kharrazi , 2019 ) . High modularity defined higher node connections inside specific cluster ( intra- community connections ) less outside cluster ( Fan , 2020 ) . use Louvain methodology algorithm recursively detect communities , uses modularity optimization runs time complexity ( n log n ) , n number nodes – services - hence better suited large networks . community detection methods might prove inefficient due time complexity ( Fan , 2020 ) . analyze entirety Portuguese service space set communities try profile clusters validate service relatedness within – measure service space homogenous – describe distinct sub-populations . 27 Figure 12 | Service Community . image show relevant – node wise - communities service space . Construction lead 50 38 nodes , respectively . Construction medical communities lead total contract values . see 17 different communities . seek profile cluster find undiscovered relationships nodes within . group similar observations good example would similar interdependent categories , e.g . food agricultural . informational list relevant ( number nodes ) communities . 28 Table 5 | Cluster Profiling . use technique used describe data get insights services grouped . table shows larger service communities ( node wise ) . see construction major group composed primarly constructions related structures materials . conclude highly diverse service portfolio inside community , varied unrelated , would probably indicate poor CPV classification . Since related services would observed together . Similarly opposite also said . computed average modularity 0.672 accounts medium modularity score ensuring groups observed distinct . ( Moody & Coleman , 2015 ) observe node distribution varies significantly metal community cluster containing 3 services whilst construction sums 50 nodes . previous chapter already noted construction services tend higher values , natural detain largest contractual values . Commonly , foodstuff fairly simple easy explain example , one would immediately think two somehow correlated densely connected , naturally ’ possible observe behavior community . Parallel , medical laboratory equipment ’ share similarities human eye , also densely connected . majority clusters seem exemplify good classification system . examples - Metal Mixed clusters , containing 3 services - predominance services indicate space improvements term deviations found space .

Although able find correlation pattern average proximity contract value . cluster profiling analysis , conclude current CPV classification system seems fit Portuguese private company ’ needs , exceptions marginal services – Metal Mixed clusters – predominance service indicates space improvements CPV classification , per discovered Portuguese procurement proximity space . Although thesis fairly incomplete understand completeness operating service space , shares important answers serve basis works . One could lie evolution service portfolio diversification relation economic growth service resilience , Portuguese companies extent areas evolving . Deriving new indicators sustainable , innovative , transparent , competitive market measure deviation relationship predictive future growth . Furthermore , would upmost value analyze impact Portuguese economic geography service diversification calculate impact globalization ( e.g . spatial distribution physical address private companies ) . Studying service space 30 regards smart specialization theories would identify possible strategic areas base place-based economic strengths define clear priorities knowledge-based investments , focusing growth supported entrepreneurial resources . Lastly , study analyze fraud activities Portuguese procurement space could significant consequences economic , social political society , safeguard loss billions euros every year .
