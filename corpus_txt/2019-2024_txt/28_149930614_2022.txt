Tools exist 3-dimensional space transported . Codes exist symbolic space . Although represented ink paper pixels screen , meaning material symbols represent . , shared using many communication technologies available . Know-how resides brains brains.1 moves enormous difficulty brain brain unconscious involve understanding . Examples ability walk , ride bike , use language infer person ’ intentions facial ex-pressions . know tasks , know hence , know teach others . part Kahneman Tversky called System 1 ( see Kahneman , 2011 ) . know-how resides wiring neurons , result long process repetition , imitation feedback . , Renaissance , conceivable , common , gifted polymaths excelled multiple disciplines , world ’ knowledge since grown much single person even master one field . Today , division knowledge across many individuals allows us overcome individual human limits makes technological progress modern societies possible ( Jones , 2009 ) . Several implications emerge . First , short run , tools , codes know-how strong complements : drive home work need car ( tool ) , need layout trans-portation network many rules ( codes ) need know drive car identify space ( know-how ) . need three complete task . time , things may change . Software applications may make driving less reliant know-how moving information interpretation tool self- driving cars may away driver altogether . moment time tools , codes know-how strongly complementary . implies implementation particular technology given point space ( i.e. , geographic diffusion ) bound limited absence tools codes , relatively easy move , absence requisite know-how . Second , given limitations much know-how fits per-son , growth know-how societal level occurs extensive margin2 division tacit knowledge individuals : whole knows individuals know different , say growth know-how happens thanks specialization . Specialization diversification , fact , two aspects phenomenon seen two different scales . individuals specialize , firms , cities , countries diversify . Yet , many scholars policy-makers wrongly equated benefits individual specialization specialization higher scales ( Hausmann , 2013 ) . example fallacy composition . matter fact , opposite true : societies specialized individuals access greater variety knowledge , therefore , diversified . “ great multiplication productions different arts , consequence division labor , occasions , well-governed society , universal opulence extends lowest ranks people ” writes Adam Smith , making point first time 1776 ( Smith , 1776 , pp.18–19 ) . Numerous empirical studies confirm developed nations , fact , diversified , supplying greater va-rieties products services ( Imbs Wacziarg , 2003 ; Bustos et al. , 2012 ; Tacchella et al. , 2013 ; Bettencourt et al. , 2014 ; Petralia et al. , 2017 ) . Third , dynamic effects specialization : enable societies accumulate collective knowledge , also allows create new knowledge . invention described many authors discovery new useful combinations existing ideas ( Weitzman , 1998 ; Fleming Sorenson , 2001 ) , society highly specialized individuals , one greater variety exper-tise , likely able combine old ideas new technologies . combinatorial aspect division knowledge serious economic consequences . Hausmann Hidalgo ( 2011 ) argue , number possibilities grows exponentially variety ele-ments combine , countries ( many ) elements weak ( strong ) incentives accumulate elements may produce ( many ) new combinations . may cause poverty trap3 responsible , least part , Great Divergence incomes observed past two centuries ( Pritchett , 1997 ) . directly leads core principle literature economic complexity : developed nations diversified , also complex . , developed nations capable supplying products services require greater variety ( hence greater amount ) knowledge . Goods services differ amount knowledge require hence variety types tools , codes know-how must available production . example , internet retailing presumes local availability internet services , electronic payments systems distribution network . also presumes team people know , design , marketing , 1 distinction codified knowledge tacit knowledge related philosophical debate Karl Popper Michael Polanyi . Popper emphasized called objective knowledge , something exists ideas society evolve social process challenged falsified . Michael Polanyi , reaction , added important dimension knowledge - called personal knowledge - , person conceptual hence , expressible words codes . See Popper ( 1972 ) Polanyi ( 1958 ) . Note , additionally , codifiable changes technology : AI instance managing embed , tools codes , know-how previously thought uniquely human . Section 2.6 , discuss codification know-how emerging area investigation economic complexity research . 2 expression extensive margin , commonly used economics , refers variety object discussion ( variety know-how case ) . contrast intensive margin , refers amount . process growth extensive margin described , instance , Jacobs ( 1969 ) , notes ancestors expand economies accumulating “ wild seeds nuts ” , adding new kinds work . Solow ’ model , contrast , provides example growth process intensive margin , capital accumulation . 3 poverty trap exists vicious cycles causation keep countries underdeveloped . concept typically associated presence multiple equilibria : country manages escape trap , cycle causation may become virtuous lead sustained economic growth . Hausmann Hidalgo ( 2011 ) call particular form poverty trap – combinatorial possibilities give incentives acquire new elements , already many elements – quiescence trap . P.-A . Balland et al . Research Policy 51 ( 2022 ) 1045683finance , accounting , procurement , contracts after-service care . means , place able make particular good service , must able assemble required knowledge components . complex products technologies highly leveraged items everybody wants know produce . 1.2 . contribution economic complexity economics related disciplines new approaches economic complexity discussed clearly related complexity areas science new approaches benefit contribute complexity developments fields . one level , brain ( society ) composed similar neurons ( humans ) capabilities emerge specialization interconnections , making idea social brain metaphor . Ecological systems involve specialized species interact trophic , mutualistic connections . Locations differ diversity species differ ubiquity . Moreover , diverse ecosystems tend host less ubiquitous species , eco-nomic systems . wonder many methods developed ecology close ones proven useful economic complexity.4 notion economic complexity adds toolbox economics least two ways . First , expands methods available reduce dimensionality problem order study it.5 common approach economics aggregate data : example , national accounts use firm , household , government customs data calculate aggre-gates gross domestic product , investment , consumption , exports imports . process , information collapsed adding different entries . Economic complexity uses methods spectral analysis network theory reduce dimensionality data ways preserve information mere aggregates . Measures economic complexity , Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ) , Fitness ( Tacchella et al. , 2012 ) production ability introduced Special Issue Bustos Yildirim ( 2021 ) ex-amples spectral methods . product/indus-try/technology/occupation spaces developed relatedness complexity literature examples methods use information locations activities estimate new measures proximity activities locations studied weighted networks . Secondly , economics difficulty studying technology . tended measure consequences : shift parameter aggregate production functions measures total factor pro-ductivity ( see survey Hulten , 2001 ) . provide connection consequences causes , may contained information erased data aggregation . Rich countries like poor countries get output capital labor inputs : produce radically different things using radically different methods production . produce data aggregation . Economic complexity methods allow us reduce data dimensionality , still capturing information countries produce —which shown important understanding productivity , income growth . Adam Smith ’ idea productivity related division labor captured endogenous growth theories , Grossman Helpman ( 1991 ) Aghion Howitt ( 1992 ) .6 papers use Dixit-Stiglitz production function treats products equally sub-stitutable one . clearly assumption simplifies algebra far reality . Ricardian models , following Eaton Kortum ( 2002 ) , country ’ comparative advantage particular product comes random draws extreme value distribution , correlation across draws . means probability comparative advantage aircraft manufacturing unrelated whether country currently producing coffee cars . Economic complexity methods make contribution making feasible introduce relevant heterogeneity industries products ( terms complexity , connectedness relatedness ) way simple , tractable empirically implementable . example , Mealy Teytelboym ( 2021 ) Special Issue use eco-nomic complexity measures map growth possibilities countries green economy . Likewise , Atkin et al . ( 2021 ) embed economic complexity measures Ricardian model trade explore impact trade growth impact capability accu-mulation . Many applications concept economic complexity explored following discussion . 1.3 . Outline Introduction Special Issue Economic Complexity , goals highlight recent rebirth interest topic stemming important work Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) . Throughout discussion hope convey general importance concept broad applicability . core arguments divided six parts Section 2 . arguments outline general framework thinking economic complexity move target issues mea-surement , links complexity economic performance , spatial concentration geographical scales complexity , concept relatedness division knowledge . Section 3 offers brief conclusion highlighting policy implications derive understanding economic complexity . 2 . Themes economic complexity 2.1 . general framework studying economic complexity parsimoniously introduce disparate themes , issues , open questions core economic complexity analysis , describe core principles literature compact math-ematical notation . Key metrics economic complexity literature based idea possible extract useful infor-mation data spatial distribution economic activities . achieved organizing information countries ( c ) produce particular products ( p ) matrix dimensions c × p. Typically , matrix denoted Mcp elements matrix assume value 1 country produces product given threshold ( zero otherwise ) . accumulation technological know-how within country expected lead diversification production increase capacity economic agents within country produce complex products . assume economic agents within countries endowed certain capabilities products require specific capabilities production , describe relation 4 instance , Hill ( 1973 ) developed method rank locations similar Economic Complexity Index . Moreover , concept nestedness – developed Patterson & Atmar ( 1986 ) , Atmar & Patterson ( 1993 ) , Almeida et al . ( 2008 ) study location species – applicable kinds matrices used economic complexity , shown Bustos et al . ( 2012 ) . 5 Dimensionality reduction process transforming large , multi- dimensional datasets compact information , easier process humans computers . Techniques typically designed maintain , transformed data , desired property original ones . 6 theories use increasing returns associated fixed cost developing new varieties . use Dixit-Stiglitz production functions inputs enter equal rates substitution . use monopolistic competition order create equilibrium spite convexity production function . conditions , productivity related number inputs used . P.-A . Balland et al . Research Policy 51 ( 2022 ) 1045684know-how output following formula : Mcp = Cca ⊙ Ppa Capabilities captured endowment matrix C di-mensions c × , stands ability ( form know-how ) . Technology , process use abilities make things , captured matrix P. Together two matrices determine makes ( location vs. product matrix , Mcp ) . operator ⊙ in-dicates relationship local availability capabilities actualization production , given technological requirements . early work , operator ⊙ assumed Leontief , meaning country location would make product product ’ vector capability requirements Ppa subset country ’ capa-bility endowment Cca . recent papers , Gomez-Lie-vano et al . ( 2016 ) assume relationship stochastic , completeness capability endowment affects probability product made . core presumption kickstarted economic complexity liter-ature , since partial knowledge ( best ) process implied Cca⊙Ppa , derive amount technological know- present country directly Mcp matrix . Economic complexity indices , fact , attempts use Mcp derive general measures complexity countries ( informative Cca ) products ( informative Ppa ) . key inference extract useful information diversity countries ’ production , well ubiquity products . Consider following two stochastic matrices : B Acp = DccMcp Bcp = McpUpp Dcc Upp diagonal matrices . entries Dcc in-verse row sums Mcp , i.e. , diversity country . entries Upp inverse column sums Mcp , i.e. , ubiquity product . original Economic Complexity Index ( ECI , Hidalgo Haumann , 2009 ) eigenvector associated second largest eigenvalue matrix AcpBcpT Product Complexity Index ( PCI ) eigenvector associated second largest eigenvalue matrix AcpT Bcp . large literature developed around alternative vectors extracted Mcp matrix incorporating different weighting schemes . Section 2.2 , review efforts , along rich discussion around interpretations different indices . Section 2.3 , discuss vectors successfully applied different empirical contexts . point , assumed dimensions Mcp matrix countries products , used compute first ECI . However , subsequent literature explored variety alternative dimensions locations ( e.g. , states , cities ) activities ( e.g . industries , technology classes , scientific fields ) . Section 2.4 focus specifically geographical dimension complexity : relevant scale capabilities come together synthesize product service ? literature economic geography , suggests knowledge primarily generated co-ordinated cities regions , inspired scholars explore eco-nomic complexity dynamics sub-national scale . Another important stream economic complexity literature revolves around concept product space ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) , thought measure similarity relatedness two products Ppa . inferred Mcp matrix two products similar rows Ppa , countries able one also able . Hence probability two products co-exported countries informative similarity . Symmetrically , one think country space , countries related similar endowment capa-bilities Cca would reflected Mcp . several alternative metrics possible , use compact framework define following product space ( PS ) country space ( CS ) matrices : PSpp = AcpTBcp CScc = AcpBcpT product space captures proximity input vectors Ppa country space capture proximity coun-tries Cca.7 One important empirical applications product space growth predictions . distance location industry capability space measured McpPSpp robust predictor Mcp subsequent period , extensive margin ( ie appearance industries present ) intensive margin ( i.e. , Mcp continuous measure presence , output dollars , rather dummy variable ) . Section 2.5 review relatedness product space literature . bulk economic complexity analysis uses variant Mcp matrix . means analysis carried “ phenotypic ” level ( i.e. , level countries products ) , without knowledge “ genotypic ” level , presumes knowledge Cca Ppa , even operator ⊙ . Yet , conception technology based division labor , presented Section 1.1 , largely based “ genotypic ” elements . skills , ca-pabilities , know-how aggregate index ? techno-logical progress – instance embedding know-how automatic tool – change skill requirements embedded matrix Ppa ? workers different capabilities interact coordinate make final product – , operator ⊙ ? Section 2.6 , discuss division labor , used economic complexity powerful idea justify “ phenotypic ” analysis , increasingly becoming fertile research ground literature , giving rise several new research branches “ genotypic ” level . 2.2 . Complexity measurement introduced , Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) devised method capture complexity individual products countries looking global pattern exports . general idea proposed complex products rare ( i.e. , low ubiquity ) , found places produce many products ( i.e. , highly diversified ) . PCI metric derived bipartite network products countries ( encoded Mcp ) , calculated using ‘ Method Re-flections ’ . functions recursively computing average diversity countries make specific product , average ubiquity products countries produce . Hence , product considered complex produced highly diversified coun-tries produce products rare made highly diversified countries . country complex , according ECI , produces many products ( i.e. , highly diversified ) , especially relatively rare ( low ubiquity ) . calculation iterated , converges second eigenvector AcpBcpT matrix . final value country ’ ECI average PCI products exports , PCI individual product average ECI countries export product . Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) Hausmann et al . ( 2014 ) show ECI values countries highly correlated GDP per capita , especially controlling natural resource wealth . importantly , deviations scatterplots country ECI GDP per capita values time predict future growth , indicating countries tend converge level income determined ECI . widely adopted within academic policy literature 7 Hausmann et al . ( 2021 ) Special Issue justify conclusions Ricardian framework . P.-A . Balland et al . Research Policy 51 ( 2022 ) 1045685 ( see discussion policy ) , somewhat complicated formulation ECI PCI measures led difficulties interpretation . Addressing issue , Mealy et al . ( 2019 ) note ECI fact Fiedler eigenvector hence equivalent two-dimensional embedding matrix AcpT Bcp , equivalently , network edge weights corresponding product co-presences . vector commonly deployed spectral clustering algorithm partitions network two parts : entries eigenvector seen ‘ distance ’ split . perspective , ECI PCI seen measures country product clustering . variety adaptations ECI approach . particular , Tacchella et al . ( 2012 ) Cristelli et al . ( 2013 ) critique ECI method based estimates complexity product . key argument complexity product defined average complexity countries producing ( case PCI ) since high complexity countries make nearly products low complexity countries make low complexity products . authors propose refinement ECI method , defining ‘ Fitness ’ country ( ‘ Quality ’ product ) based iterative scheme weighs heavily low Fitness exporters estimating Quality product . methodological issues stability conver-gence algorithm pointed ( Morrison et al. , 2017 ) improved ( Servedio et al. , 2018 ) . recently , Sciarra et al . ( 2020 ) united methods ( ECI Fitness ) common math-ematical framework , proposed new metric , GENEPY index , combines information ECI Fitness . authors argue one advantage index easily interpreted computed standard node centrality measure derived product similarity network . general , one see ECI , Fitness GENEPY members large family metrics complexity derived spatial patterns production . Brummitt et al . ( 2020 ) took agnostic approach whether single measure adequately describe economic perfor-mance , developed machine learning algorithm identify main statistical patterns evolution country export baskets . algorithm revealed quantity captured 50 % variance export baskets fifty years data , authors show “ complexity-weighted ” measure diversity . metrics typically derived cross-sectional spatial patterns production , several recent models aim construct complexity metric based probability model temporal capability accumulation . example , ’ Clery et al . ( 2021 ) developed method uncover ’ product ecosystems ’ , set products need present new product appear export basket country . au-thors develop probabilistic model directed , dynamic process capability accumulation product diversification countries , show low- middle-income countries move small ecosystem ( low complexity ) products large ecosystem ( high complexity ) products time . Focusing cities , Gomez-Lievano Patterson-Lomba ( 2018 ) develop model probability individual city employed given urban activity takes account activity-specific complexity , individual-specific know-how , city-specific collective know-how . model based comple-mentarity stochastic accumulation factors time , well diversity factors within urban areas , estimated using in-dustry employment data US cities . set models aim connect complexity metrics well- known economic models trade production . Schetter ( 2021 ) embeds ECI framework general equilibrium model inter-national trade . work shows close variant ECI produces ranking countries corresponds country complexities derived multi-product Eaton Kortum trade model assumption log-supermodular productivities ( e.g. , complex econo-mies export relatively complex products ) . Bustos Yildirim ( 2021 ) build Hausmann Hidalgo ( 2011 ) propose new approach approximate capabilities present places industries based relaxation binary Leontief framework . model , common assumption nested capabilities ( Bustos et al. , 2012 ) requirement capabilities present relaxed . show country- city-level metrics correlate income economic growth , predict product appearances disap-pearances time . wide variety approaches introduced ( many implemented using export employment data ) typically agnostic methodological viewpoint type ‘ capabilities ’ capture . Supported large literature role locally embedded worker know-how learning capability base place ( Nelson Winter , 2002 ; Neffke Henning , 2013 ; Diodato et al. , 2018 ) , parallel set methods focus estimating knowledge complexity sub-national regions , occupations technologies . , divide studies based spatial patterns production innovation , based alternative modeling strategies . first category , focusing production new knowledge , Balland Rigby ( 2017 ) apply approach developed Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) patent data , using concentration patents across technology classes US cities compute technology city complexity metrics . find knowledge unevenly distributed across United States , cities com-plex technologies necessarily highest rates patenting . second strand literature category focuses occupations . Mealy et al . ( 2019 ) apply approach developed Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) compute complexity metrics based occupation-region employment concentrations , revealing patterns occupational specialization across US states . Lo Turco Maggioni ( 2021 ) Special Issue deploy information * NET skill content jobs . Comparing complexity industries ( derived export data using Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) approach ) knowledge content occupations industry , find complex industries intensive STEM knowledge skill re-quirements . authors propose new measure occupational complexity industries based presence specific STEM-related skills , show predictive GDP per capita growth US cities comparable metrics . second category models focuses estimating combinatorial complexity technologies , made practically possible via detailed information technology combinations provided patent data . Pio-neering approach , Fleming Sorenson ( 2001 , 2004 ) developed evolutionary model innovation yields measure complexity individual patents based difficulty combining knowledge subsets ( technology sub-classes ) US patent data . work connects NK model ( Kauffman Levin , 1987 ) , widely used mathematical model describes evolutionary exploration ‘ landscape ’ encodes complexity system terms number elements ( N ) degree interdependence ( K ) . Extending approach Fleming Sorenson , Broekel ( 2019 ) developed measure technological complexity via characteriza-tion diversity structural patterns technologies ’ combinatorial networks ( capture co-occurrence patterns associated sub-classes ) . applying approach EU patent data , measure yields index replicating many features usually associated technological complexity continuous growth time , spatial concentration stronger collaboration . 2.3 . Complexity performance economic complexity literature views economic development structural transformation process , whereby economic growth results transformation country ’ productive structure one dominated simple low-tech activities , typically unprocessed primary products , one characterized technologically advanced manufacturing processes . emphasizing changes composition P.-A . Balland et al . Research Policy 51 ( 2022 ) 1045686output , complexity approach growth development related literature structural transformation ( see Herrendorf et al. , 2014 review ) . literature emphasizes difference productivity levels growth across sectors countries regions . example , Duarte Restuccia ( 2010 ) find smaller productivity differences across countries manufacturing agriculture services , larger productivity convergence agriculture manufacturing services . Rodrik ( 2013 ) finds unconditional cross-country convergence manufacturing aggregate productivity . economic complexity perspective help us interpret findings make precise . One implication productivity convergence intensive margin extensive margin : existing manufacturing activities find easier improve , hard get new activities requisite capabilities may missing . , convergence occur beyond existing tradable ac-tivities . fact product space ( see Hidalgo et al. , 2007 section relatedness ) highly structured countries located different parts means significant variance capacity converge based country ’ position space . findings documented Felipe et al . ( 2012 ) , Hausmann et al . ( 2013 ) , Cristelli et al . ( 2015 ) , Gala et al . ( 2018 ) . link economic complexity economic growth attracted lot attention , scholars also looked issues inequality sustainability . Focusing period 1962–2000 , Hartmann et al . ( 2017 ) find support idea income inequality lower countries export complex goods . Theoretically , propose direct connection two constructs rather suggest “ productive structures represent high-resolution expression number factors , institutions education , co-evolve country ’ mix exported products inclusiveness economy ” ( p. 85 ) . Focusing different period ( 1964–2013 ) , Fawaz Rahnama-Moghadamm ( 2019 ) find trade economically complex countries negatively correlated income inequality . Sbardella et al . ( 2017 ) also ran large-scale cross-country analysis period 1963–2008 found inver-ted U shape relationship index complexity wage inequality , line theoretical predictions Kuznets ( 1955 ) . Interestingly , however , also look within US time window 1990–2014 find opposite trend , namely US counties become complex , wage inequality also increases . cross-country result explained way social struggles , democratization institutional strengthening achieved via economic growth , mechanisms within-country result less neatly explained except result might driven changes counties ’ sectoral composition . Zhu et al . ( 2020 ) also interest understanding link economic complexity exports economic inequality sub-national level : focus rural-urban divide Chinese regions ( 1989–2013 ) find export complexity associated lower income inequality urban areas complex industrial structure offers diverse working opportunities , greater resilience shocks , workers skilled capable networking increasing bargaining power firms . However , also find economic inequality decline regions ’ rural areas – result explain way limitations imposed rural inhabitants move urban areas . , increasing economic complexity countries appears associated greater economic growth cross-country conver-gence , impact across- within-country inequality less clear cut deserves research , especially pin causal mechanisms . Another important issue connection economic complexity environmental performance . suggest eco-nomic complexity improves environmental performance coun-tries . Sbardella et al . ( 2018 ) find positive relationship country ’ GDP measure green complexity capturing extent country patents complex green technologies . Hence , economically advanced countries also sophisticated inventors green technologies . Another strand literature shows low eco-nomic inequality comes greater complexity green technologies – result explained presence middle class creates demand green innovations allows economies scale production ( Napolitano et al. , 2020 ) . Mealy Teytelboym ( 2021 ) Special Issue make significant contribution study green complexity pooling together existing environmental goods clas-sifications – WTO , OECD APEC - unique dataset green traded products 1995 2014 . Using novel data , produce set country-level indices measure extent country complex green production capabilities , indices also useful predict countries ’ future diversification opportunities . Others raised interesting questions whether richer complex economies also able curb environmental problems . Romero Gramkov ( 2021 ) find economically complex countries lower greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission intensity , ascribe result fact higher complexity leads effi-cient products less contaminating . Using sample 88 countries observed period 2002–2012 , Lapatinas et al . ( 2019 ) find positive correlation country ’ economic complexity environmental performance , measured composite index includes emissions , protection health environmental policies . also show correlates positively CO2 PM 2.5 emissions , latter connected emergence cancer health issues . Neagu ( 2019 ) finds inverted U-shape relationship economic complexity CO2 emissions 25 European Union countries period 1995–2007 . Finally , inequality environmental performance two issues concern sustainable development agenda , areas attracted interest migration . know-how resides brains , moves difficulty brain brain , moving brains may become critical movement knowhow , diffusion technology growth complexity . long literature documented importance migration technological diffusion ( Saxenian , 2006 ; Moser et al. , 2014 ; Hausmann Nedelkoska , 2018 ; Diodato et al. , 2021 ) . Bahar et al . ( 2014 ) provide evidence in-ternational diffusion competitive advantage , others established links movement complex capabilities FDI flows , suggesting different pathways countries build complexity ( Khan et al. , 2020 ) . Mayneris Poncet ( 2015 ) provide evidence capability spillovers co-located foreign domestic Chinese firms . Coscia et al . ( 2020 ) find evidence business travel countries industry knowledge predicts growth productivity , employment exports industries recipient country , providing evidence importance human mobility movement specific elements knowhow . Bahar et al . ( 2021 ) Special Issue find complex economies characterized greater immigrants ’ birthplace diversity , showing diversity workers ’ geographical origin – especially among college-educated mi-grants – leads greater diversity destination export basket . would interesting explore broader social justice issues , social cohesion human rights protection , change countries acquire productive capabilities become complex . complex products sustainable social sense require deeper forms human cooperation correlated greater social cohesion rights ? 2.4 . Complexity geographical scale Complex economic activities tend concentrate space . Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) exploit fact measures complexity international scale . Interest economic complexity , relevance understanding uneven development , grown rapidly sub-national scale . early work using export data P.-A . Balland et al . Research Policy 51 ( 2022 ) 1045687panel Chinese cities , Poncet Waldemar ( 2013 ) report eco-nomic complexity robust determinant economic growth . Using patent data , Balland Rigby ( 2017 ) explore shifts complexity knowledge production across US metropolitan areas . EU regions , Balland et al . ( 2019 ) use measures relatedness density identify knowledge cores regions proxy cost developing new technology growth paths . returns developing growth paths measured complexity-based indicators value competing technologies . Gao Zhou ( 2018 ) explore evolution complexity across Chinese provinces since 2000 . report faster growth complexity coastal regions China strong positive relationship economic complexity level GDP per capita . Firm-level export data used Zhou et al . ( 2019 ) document increase complexity Chinese exports city-level . Export upgrading tied capabilities sourced within firm within region . 2021 Research Policy Special Issue Economic Complexity , several papers confirm complex knowledge unevenly distributed across European regions . Antonelli et al . ( 2021 ) provide evidence complex knowledge concentrates productive European re-gions . report complexity regional knowledge base affects regional innovation positively , productivity performance negatively . Using similar metrics , Pintar Scherngell ( 2021 ) show complex technologies , Digital Communication , Telecommunications , Computer Technology tend spatially concentrated , i.e. , least ubiquitous . Mewes Broekel ( 2021 ) find similar pattern using different approach complexity based structural diversity knowledge development Broekel ( 2019 ) . find ability regions produce exploit complex technologies explains regional economic growth . papers stress fundamental idea complexity metrics , one form another , allow authors go beyond patent counts capture qualitative differences regional knowledge production . Pintar Scherngell ( 2021 ) , particular , highlight benefit development place-based innovation policy smart specialization strategy . noted , complex economic activities cluster space . However , cluster random parts world . ’ Clery et al . ( 2018 ) Balland et al . ( 2020 ) reveal complex economic activities systematically concentrate large cities . Complexity , alone , explain 40 % 80 % variance urban concentration occupations , industries , scientific fields , technologies . spatial concentration cutting-edge technologies large cities increased since 1850 . discussed Section 2.1 , complex activities require deeper division knowledge . division knowledge creates high coordination costs cities help solve creating multiple mixing matching oppor-tunities . Gomez-Lievano et al . ( 2016 ) contribute literature developing model explains complex economic activities tend occur larger diverse urban hubs . Frank et al . ( 2018 ) show spatial variance expands beyond production knowledge . cities face greater impact automation employment smaller , least complex least diversified ones , adding another dynamic source spatial inequality going forward . 2.5 . Relatedness Relatedness , describes relationship different classes economic activities , emerged powerful concept explain economic diversification technological upgrading ( Breschi et al. , 2003 ; Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ; Neffke et al. , 2011 ) . two roots different interpretations underpinnings relatedness . one hand , two activities related vectors capability requirements ( Ppa ) similar . consequence , easier country move existing activities related activities involves fewer missing capabilities . interpretation , moving to-wards related activities feasible , necessarily valuable . alternative , older , approach relatedness rooted learning processes encompasses multiple components , alongside core concepts complementarity similarity . References complementarity coherence first surged emergence resource-based view firm highlighting competitive advantage arises combining heterogeneous resources ( Barney , 1991 ; Dyer Singh , 1998 ; Teece et al. , 1994 ) . concept similarity emphasizes shared cognitive features joint root knowledge domains facilitates effective easier learning ( Stuart , 1998 ) . Nooteboom ( 1999 ) added potential gains combining similar ( knowledge ) resources peak optimal level cognitive distance ( relatedness ) , small large dissimilarities either hamper learning offer little potential novelty . Crucially , relatedness describes proximity different categories economic activities ( sets thereof ) , applica-tion usually requires structural perspective . key substantive focus within research area relatedness transformation economies mechanism diversification . principle relatedness stresses probability diversification shaped existence multiple related activities , one particular activity . Assessing activities based embeddedness within wider set relations activities underlies prominent concepts corporate coherence ( Teece et al. , 1994 ) related well unrelated variety ( Frenken et al. , 2007 ) . literature ( resource ) completeness ( resource ) portfolios add context relation two activities frequently shaped presence expertise ( multiple ) others ( Carnahan et al. , 2010 ; Medcof , 2000 ) . Consequently , understand apply idea relatedness , essential look full set relations activities . set frequently defined , often mapped , relatedness space vi-sualizes different sorts proximities . Since original product space mapping set Hidalgo et al . ( 2007 ) , regularly refer knowledge space built around technologies ( Breschi et al. , 2003 ; Kogler et al. , 2013 ) , industry space ( Essletzbichler , 2015 ; Neffke et al. , 2011 ) , occupation space ( Muneepeerakul et al. , 2013 ) , space scientific disciplines ( Lyu et al. , 2020 ) . Measuring proximity subsets economic activities deploying ‘ space ’ ‘ network ’ perspec-tives generalizing principle relatedness ( Hidalgo et al. , 2018 ) massively contributed popularity relatedness concept within outside academia . particular , gave rise new perspective economic development providing methodological toolbox identify path dependencies diversification processes countries , regions , firms ( Breschi et al. , 2003 ; Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ; Neffke et al. , 2011 ) . Since inception , relatedness measured “ pheno-typic ” level ( i.e. , Mcp matrix used observe co-occurrence products infer ones similar ) , without knowledge “ genotypic ” level ( presumes knowledge Ppa ) . studies relatedness tell us products related tell us . Several papers past years begun change . Diodato et al . ( 2018 ) build Ellison et al . ( 2010 ) show co-location industries driven , increasingly uniquely , industries sharing occupational needs . Similarly , Diodato Schetter ( 2020 ) show country ’ industrial diversification path predicted using product space calculated similarity occupational re-quirements products Ppa , assuming inputs occu-pations . Using patent data , Juhász et al . ( 2021 ) show development technological relatedness shaped co-concentration technological capabilities space . Pugliese et al . ( 2019 ) tackle question , albeit different method : formalize concept multi-layer space : instead looking industry similarities based underlying extra layer ( e.g . occupational over-lap industries Diodato Schetter , 2020 ) , look similarity different categories data , measuring co-occurrence different layers ( e.g . similarity patent class P.-A . Balland et al . Research Policy 51 ( 2022 ) 1045688and industry ) . multi-layer product space weighted version following formula : MPSpa = McpTCca . Special Issue , Catalán et al .

( 2019 ) . authors combine information scientific ( publications ) technological ( patents ) relatedness develop broader measures competences countries based cross-density scientific technological capabilities . measure explain tech-nological diversification better traditional unidimensional mea-sures , paper advances promising new research trajectory exploring multi-dimensional nature relatedness . research also needed better understand path- dependent nature relatedness processes translates comparative advantage growth . Hausmann et al . ( 2021 ) Special Issue focus matters . developing modified Ricardian-model , authors estimate comparative advantage industry specific location based comparative advantage similar industries similar locations . shown approach predicts long-term employment growth . addition , paper over-comes shortcoming many traditional trade models treat in-dustries independent . contrast , proposed model allows industry productivity impacted related industries . Dosi et al . ( 2021 ) , Special Issue , continue tradition early literature relatedness evaluating role corporate coherence ( Teece et al. , 1994 ) . Besides adding much-needed empirical evidence context developing countries , authors also explicitly address account firms ’ heterogeneity diversification event . Crucially , authors show coherence matters firms ’ growth , also profitability . Yet , relevance relatedness economic performance still anything clear . far , main mechanism whereby relatedness shapes economic performance path-dependent selection process guiding ( ) firms regions towards activities higher economic potential ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) . process , however , fully understood relatedness perspective alone . Using trade data , Pinheiro et al . ( 2021 ) , Special Issue , dig relationship unrelated diversification complexity . study shows direction diversification , related ( path-dependent ) unrelated ( path-breaking ) , conditional existing level country complexity . particular , unrelated diversification becomes likely high levels complexity . summary , studies 2021 Research Policy Special Issue Economic Complexity clearly highlight need move beyond investigating relatedness isolation factors . particularly case relatedness provides indications di-rection speed path-dependent processes insufficient evaluate processes ’ economic value . latter rather shaped interplay relatedness complexity , possibly represents promising avenue research . 2.6 . Division knowledge division knowledge served backbone main research themes literature : complexity production , relat-edness diversification . However , nuanced aspects paradigm increasingly becoming subject research literature . First , trade change picture ? autarchy , little doubt links individual specialization , societal diver-sification , growth . open economy , market pressure surely must pushing diversification : even country productive industries would find convenient disinvest activities ( Dornbusch et al. , 1977 ) . happen resources finite employing one industry opportunity costs . handful papers beginning investigate paradigm economic complexity affected trade . Schetter ( 2021 ) instance shows technology log-supermodular , trade lead specialization , ( less ) complex countries tend specialize ( less ) complex goods . Schetter shows , world , economic complexity index would appropriate measure country ’ technological advantage . suggests growing economies continue diversify terms know-how productive capabilities choose use capabilities fewer , complex products , i.e. , products require knowhow . Special Issue Van Dam Frenken ( 2021 ) propose combinatorial model growth , although general equilibrium , incorporates opportunity cost mechanism ( interpreted rising salaries growing country ) . show country diversifies certain point , begins abandoning simpler varieties . also account empirical observation high level development , production portfolio countries tends ( moderately ) re-concentrate ( Imbs Wacziarg , 2003 ; Cadot et al. , 2011 ) . Schetter ( 2020 ) shows one allows differences quality , advanced countries remain low complexity products specializing higher qualities . Second , noted Becker Murphy ( 1992 ) , specialization division knowledge necessarily come coordination costs . aspect certainly understudied context literature eco-nomic complexity , papers explore new domain . Neffke ( 2019 ) , instance , shows benefits di-vision labor materialize specialized individuals embedded teams complementary workers . Special Issue , Botta et al . ( 2021 ) compare functioning financial markets principles economic complexity argue , much like production , financial knowledge distributed across many specialized agents . find type complexity associated positive economic growth increases volatility . Finally , technology tacit knowledge know-how . also knowledge embodied tools ( e.g. , machines ) codes ( e.g. , blueprints ) . technological progress enables us transfer human know-how autonomous machines , expertise workers may become obsolete . studying effects automation long tradition economics ( Autor et al. , 2003 ; Acemoglu Restrepo , 2020 ) , literature economic complexity beginning explore meaning automation particular vantage point . Much like product space predict evolution economy growth trajectory , recent papers use information knowledge , skills abilities required different occupations construct occupational spaces explore impact automation labor market outcomes . Alabdulkareem et al . ( 2018 ) , instance , use cluster analysis show wage polarization labor market reflected polarized network skills , low-paying jobs belonging isolated community sensory-physical abilities . Nedelkoska et al . ( 2018 ) develop task occupation spaces using knowledge , skills abilities * NET find knowledge highly transferable across tasks , occupations high risk automation belong parts occupational space make necessary switch harder achieve . Del Rio-Chanona et al . ( 2019 ) combine search matching model occupational mobility networks argue latter key understanding long-term dynamics unemployment technological transition . Overall , role human capital vibrant area research literature . Hence , division knowledge may represent origin economic complexity , also future . 3 . Conclusion : economic complexity innovation policy Since first industrial revolution , exponential gains economic complexity accrued tandem unprecedented levels innovation wealth generation . trillion isolated individuals could never build airplane , let alone put human moon , far smaller number interacting agents specialize trade , given right incentives , produce dizzying array massively com-plex products . Complex products , complex sets capabilities P.-A . Balland et al . Research Policy 51 ( 2022 ) 1045689which rest , emerge deep divisions labor driven competition within market economy . first direct policy implication field economic complexity countries regions specialize complex economic activ-ities ( Hausmann et al. , 2011 ; Balland et al. , 2019 ; Hidalgo , 2021 ) . Supporting economic upgrading building complex capabilities superior development strategy chasing ability produce high-priced goods . Commodity prices shift rapidly changing market conditions , regulations , customer preferences . Developing capabilities create produce complex products viable path secure long-run growth capabilities tend evolve self-reinforcing processes recombination , rewarding actors , firms , places already embedded networks complex activity . One unfortunate consequence growth concentration economic complexity rising levels inequality . nature , complex systems also tend unequal . Preferential attachment , compounding , self-reinforcing feedback loops , multiplicative pro-cesses inherent complex adaptive systems increase inequality . result , individuals , organizations , places occupy privileged positions leverage larger parts economy ’ structure accumulate benefits . Others much less fortunate , either wrong skills , located wrong place , face factors prevent engaging economic activities . modern world , inequality striking . Walmart ’ Walton family leverages labor structures , Warren Buffet leverages capital , digital platforms leverage code media secure expand dominant economic positions . consistent earlier innovation research points uneven distribu-tional effects technological revolutions advancements ( e.g. , Perez , 2013 ) suggests need find new ways govern capitalism order avoid concentration economic political power detriment society ( Giuliani , 2018 ) . ideas echo recent empirical research showing technological giants handling generating highly complex knowledge domains ICT artificial intel-ligence built knowledge monopolies innovations exclu-sive access data ( Rikap Lundvall , 2020 ) , others raised concerns geographic distributional imbalances caused high tech companies ’ concentration monopoly rents ( Feldman et al. , 2021 ) . monopolies create fat-tailed distributions challenge existing ( cohesion-oriented ) social structures . imbalances in-equalities generated growing complexity require new policy re-sponses generate equitable returns secure futures . complexity shapes multiple dimensions economic develop-ment , inequality generates also manifest different forms . One pervasive forms uneven spatial development . Larger , urban centers advanced industrialized economies primary beneficiaries growth complexity ( Mewes Broekel , 2021 ; Pintar Scherngell , 2021 ; Van Dam Frenken , 2021 ) . Given self-reinforcing nature complexity , uneven development diffi-cult manage slow . Yet , policy must confront spatial consequences complexity , rapid urbanization siphoning resources peripheral regions often viewed “ places ’ matter ” , fueling populism social unrest ( Rodríguez-Pose , 2018 ) . Given path-dependent nature processes , likely complexity dynamics tend reinforce current status rather breaking-up existing structures . case , fundamental dynamics economic complexity require policy response . raise prospects working less complex econ-omies ? general goal help economies leverage capabil-ities already possess diversify complex forms economic activity . Thus , smart investment economic development involves identifying foundations existing strengths mapping potential pathways towards complex set capabilities . Identi-fication pathways requires knowledge “ distances ” economic activities . Measures economic relatedness span occupations , products , industries , technologies provide “ distance ” metrics ( see Pinheiro et al. , 2021 Special Issue ) . second complexity policy directive stems fact new sets capabilities created recombining pre-existing capabilities ( Mowery et al. , 1998 ) . toolbox economic complexity , fact , also becoming prominent policy programs European Commission , including innovation industrial strategies ( Pugliese Tacchella , 2020 ) smart specialization ( Balland et al. , 2019 ) . Yet , relatedness complexity seem considered support strategies , rare find strategically combined , regional priorities seem based complexity relatedness concerns isolation ( Deegan et al. , 2021 ) . research required develop place-based policy interventions utilize relatedness support emergence complex activities . Continued growth levels economic complexity implies specialization likely demand increased interdependencies economic system . important consequences questions resilience exogenous shocks multiple spatial scales . interdependent systems vulnerable sudden disruptions , complex systems contrast usually exhibit remarkable robustness . case , increasing interdependence system needs go hand-in-hand decentralization decision making capabil-ities , well dynamic capabilities reconfiguration . latter may much structure agency . , research started . applies sustainability since enhanced complexity regions world may neither neutral positive impact non-complex regions . Increasing interactions specialized actors likely imply movements people , goods , energy , involve substantial environmental social costs . instance , increasing mobility talent drains envi-ronmental resources , also challenges established social networks cultural embeddedness , consequence individual well social well-being . growing complexity economy yielded levels pros-perity innovation would imaginable decades ago . provided policy opportunities economic devel-opment also entirely new set challenges . Managing human hyperconnectivity consequences – ranging climate change , inequality , spatial polarization , disease transmission – might one pressing policy challenges 21st century .
