Economists investigated diasporas impact economy origin countries , particularly terms eco-nomic development ( Bahar 2020 ) . One hotly debated issues role remittances , two opposing views : optimistic one sees positive effects pessimistic one denies ( Clemens McKenzie 2018 ; Naudé et al . 2017 ; Yang 2011 ) . One less explored issue regarding role remittances economy impact creating new firms . paper aims address gap examine whether economic complexity country relevant under-standing impact remittances new firm creation . research framed around three key points.Firstly , last decades , remittances grown exponentially $ 122 million 2000 $ 706 million 2020 , representing fivefold increase ( Fig . 1 ) ( World Bank 2021 ) . many countries , remittances become pri-mary financial flow , surpassing foreign direct investment official development assistance flows . Furthermore , significant portion international remittances transmitted informal channels goes unrecorded official statistics.1 growing importance remittances investment purposes drawn attention scholars various fields , economics , management , entrepreneurship , international development agencies ( Ratha 2003 , 2007 ) . Although remittances 01,00,0002,00,0003,00,0004,00,0005,00,0006,00,0007,00,0008,00,000200020012002200320042005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017201820192020Fig . 1 Migrant remittance inflows ( US $ million ) Source : World Bank1 Ratha ( 2017 ) claims unrecorded flows informal channels least 50 per cent larger recorded flows.1 3Economic Change Restructuring primarily used non-investment purposes , food , housing , education , shown stimulate new investments source financial funds . fact , many studies suggested remittances play potentially positive role new business creation . Single-country ( e.g. , Kiliç et al . 2009 ; Woodruff Zenteno 2007 ) cross-country studies ( e.g. , Cummings et al . 2021 ; Yavuz Bahadir 2022 ) found positive correlation remittances new business activ-ities . studies hypothesize remittances increase entrepreneurial activities providing financial resources new investments.Secondly , new firms generate employment larger incumbent firms ( Haltiwanger 2015 ) , explains policymakers try design policy incen-tives promote entrepreneurship ( Ratinho et al . 2020 ) . However , many coun-tries , particularly low-income ones , lack capital needed start new firms . remittances migrants provide alternative additional source funding new businesses , could significantly benefit economic social well-being countries.Thirdly , surprising connection economic complexity entrepreneurship received little attention literature . According Nguyen et al . ( 2021 ) , existing empirical studies determinants entrepreneurship tend adopt either micro- macro-perspective , occasionally exploring impact government efficiency institutional quality . However , overlook crucial role economy ’ structure entrepreneurship . recent survey , Ratinho et al . ( 2020 ) suggest future research investigate relationship eco-nomic structure entrepreneurship.In paper , make several contributions literature . Firstly , show impact real per capita remittances ( REM ) new firm creation inversely mediated economic complexity . Since economic complexity positively corre-lated economic development , remittances likely facilitate estab-lishment new firms less developed economies rather advanced ones . Secondly , sub-sample analysis high upper-middle-income ( HUMI ) countries one hand low- lower-middle-income ( LLMI ) countries corroborates hypothesis regarding positive impact REM new limited liability company ( NLLC ) creation LLMI countries negative impact HUMI countries . Furthermore , sub-samples economic com-plexity index ( ECI ) negatively mediates impact REM NLLC . Thirdly , sub-sample analysis regional level ( Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America Caribbean ) reveals Africa , average marginal effect REM NLLC creation negative , despite increasing ECI grows . Asia , average marginal effect REM NLLC creation positive decreases ECI increases . Europe , find positive negative role , whereas , Latin American Caribbean countries , observe consistently positive average marginal effect REM NLLC creation , increases ECI increases . Fourthly , based empirical results , present discuss policy implications . find-ings suggest economic policies tailored specific needs country address challenges face . Policy initiatives reducing infor-mality , improving competition , lowering remittance transfer costs , introducing special legal status new firms created remittances would facilitate Economic Change Restructuring1 3channelling remittances toward new business creation . Additionally , institutions origin countries encourage creation diaspora networks increase awareness new business opportunities respective countries origin.Due data availability constraints , examine 78 countries 2006 2020 empirical analysis , use negative binomial regression model esti-mate relationship remittances , economic complexity , new firm cre-ation . estimation strategy suitable dependent variable over-dispersed count variable.The remainder paper structured follows . next section , review relevant literature . Section 3 provides detailed account empirical investi-gation , Sect . 4 presents results . Policy implications discussed Sect . 5 , paper concludes Sect . 6.2 Literature reviewThe literature impact remittances economic complexity , effect new firms , role remittances new firm creation still early stages , studies available citation . knowledge , interre-lated connections among remittances , economic complexity , creation new firms never explored.Saadi ( 2020 ) analyzed impact remittances economic complexity found significant positive effect complexity products exported developing emerging countries . Using unbalanced panel 2002 2014 , maintains remittances encourage business investment entrepreneurial use remittances enables developing countries upgrade production diversify exports complex goods ( Saadi 2020 , p. 19 ) .Nguyen et al . ( 2021 ) Ajide ( 2022 ) recently analyzed impact eco-nomic complexity entrepreneurship . Nguyen et al . ( 2021 ) argue “ improve-ments economic complexity reflect development economic systems conditions boost industrial production enhance product quality ” “ improved conditions usually associated business opportunities ( demands new products services ) well risks ( competition multiple newcomers ) entrepreneurs ” ( Nguyen et al . 2021 ; p. 2 ) . Following prem-ises , show entrepreneurship density , i.e. , number new firms working-age population , follows inverted U-shaped function economic com-plexity . conceptualize finding increasing economic complexity leading two potentially conflicting results : creating new opportunities opening new firms bringing higher levels competition uncertainties entrepreneurs , particularly country already achieved high levels complexity . Ajide ( 2022 ) evaluates impact economic complexity entrepreneurship 18 African countries 2006 2017 . finds positive relationship new firm density economic complexity suggests entrepreneurship “ strengthened ethnic religious diversity reduced weak political institu-tions ” ( Ajide 2022 , p. 383 ) . Given African countries operate low levels economic complexity , findings surprising.1 3Economic Change Restructuring Several studies explored impact immigrants ’ remittances new firm creation.2 seminal work area Vaaler ’ ( 2011 ) analysis 61 non-OECD developing countries 2002 2007 . Among findings , Vaaler reports remittances alone affect new firm creation . How-ever , introduces interaction term remittances state share economy ( measured share GDP accounted government state-owned enterprises ) , observes positive impact remittances new firm creation low levels state share economy , disappears state share economy increases.Since Vaaler ’ ( 2011 ) pioneering work , empirical research relationship remittances new firm creation grown , studies including Mar-tinez et al . ( 2015 ) , Hanusch Vaaler ( 2015 ) , Cummings Gamlen ( 2019 ) , Cummings et al . ( 2021 ) , Yavuz Bahar ( 2022 ) , Bettin et al . ( 2022 ) , Ajide Osinubi ( 2022 ) , Nanyiti Sseruyange ( 2022 ) , Alhassan ( 2023 ) .Martinez et al . ( 2015 ) examine relationship informality , remit-tances , venture funding availability , new firm starts sample 38 developing countries 2001 2009 . find remittances increase new firms starts informality increases . Interestingly , also find informality nil , effect remittances new firms starts negative , point-ing toward re-direction remittances toward household consumption rather investments . Similarly , Hanusch Vaaler ( 2015 ) investigate whether positive impact remittances new firm creation constrained capital access sample 47 developing countries 2002–2007 period . find remittances increase new firm birth , effect diminishes capital access increases . Cummings Gamlen ( 2019 ) study whether diaspora engage-ment policies pursued many developing emerging countries amplify pos-itive impacts remittances entrepreneurship . consider sample 35 countries observed 2001 2010 find remittances positively affect new venture funding availability new firm creation . Moreover , confirm conjecture magnifying effect diaspora engagement institutions remittances favor new firm creation . Cummings et al . ( 2021 ) focus sample 29 developing countries 2001 2010 find remittances 2 present study , analyze role real per capita remittances new limited liabilities com-panies ( new firms ’ registration ) take data world development indicators ( see sub-Sect . 3.1 details ) . Another strand empirical literature studies impact remittances entrepre-neurship using Global Entrepreneurship Monitor ( GEM ) database . data collected GEM com-prises two complementary tools : Adult Population Survey ( APS ) National Expert Survey ( NES ) . former explores individual ’ role entrepreneurial process ’ lifecycle administered survey ( 2000 adults interviewed ) . latter assesses status Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions ( EFCs ) interviews least 36 experts . research questions satisfactorily addressed consists self-reported data rather company registration data . reason , literature section , review works ; interested reader see recent paper Bedi et al . ( 2020 ) references therein . general surveys regarding new firms ’ creation , see recent contributions Ratinho et al . ( 2020 ) perspective manage-rial sciences Lu et al . ( 2020 ) general approach also includes works fields accounting , economics , finance , innovation , organization studies . Quite surprisingly , neither former latter cite papers dealing role remittances entrepreneurship . Economic Change Restructuring1 3from migrants residing abroad less year significantly increase venture founding rates , measured newly registered firms . interpret result reflecting stronger home-country identity migrants reside abroad remit agents home help found new ventures provide livelihoods migrants upon return . Yavuz Bahadir ( 2022 ) primarily interested role ethnic diversity new business creation . Using data 64 developing countries 2006 2016 , find migrant remittances correlate posi-tively new business creation , ethnic diversity strengthens positive association . According Yavuz Bahadir 2022 , p. 1943 ) , positive link depends special relationship migrants maintain left behind . view , migrants ’ remittances act founding resources new firms , also inject new knowledge , skills , practices home countries . Authors ( 2022 ) studied large panel 143 countries 2006 2018 investigated role social financial remittances new firm creation . find kinds remittances positively signifi-cantly correlated new firm creation entire sample 143 countries effect financial remittances depends level social remittances . social remittances exceed threshold level , financial remittances con-tribute new firm creation . also perform disaggregated analysis , separat-ing developing developed countries non-OECD OECD countries . results developing non-OECD countries similar entire sample , developed OECD countries seem benefit remittances booster new firm creation.The last three papers remittances new firm creation , namely Ajide Osinubi ( 2022 ) , Nanyiti Sseruyange ( 2022 ) , Alhassan ( 2023 ) , use firms ’ density ( NLLC per 1000 working-age population ) dependent variable instead absolute number new firms ’ creation . Ajide Osinubi ( 2022 ) use sam-ple 19 African countries 2006 2017 find foreign aid remit-tance harm new firms ’ density . However , remittances mitigate negative impact foreign aid entrepreneurship , indicating variables complemen-tary improving level entrepreneurship Africa . claim formal entrepreneurship involves high start-up costs Africa , discouraging potential entrepreneurs starting new business . become formal entrepreneur , one needs bear higher cost formalizing operations higher risks compared alternatives , trade disincentives engage entrepreneur-ship . Nanyiti Sseruyange ( 2022 ) analyze 63 developing developed coun-tries find positive effect remittances firms ’ density , stronger LLMI countries disappears HUMI countries . Alhassan ( 2023 ) inves-tigates effectiveness e-government mechanism reducing migrants ’ transaction costs promoting remittance-based opportunity entrepreneurship 55 African , Asian , Oceanian , Latin American countries 2007 2019 . empirical results entire sample indicate role remittances , statistically negative direct effect found African countries . However , also finds e-government positively moderates association remittances new firms ’ density.1 3Economic Change Restructuring summary findings regarding link remittances new firms presented Table 1 . Three main results emerge field research . First , studies find positive ( non-negative ) link remittances new firm creation . Second , role remittances mediated factors . Third , empirical research focuses almost exclusively developing African countries.This study aims extend literature exploring interconnected relation-ships among remittances , economic complexity , new firm creation . achieve , use large sample heterogeneous countries split LLMI HUMI countries . also conduct disaggregated regional analysis con-tinental level , focusing Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America Caribbean.3 Empirical investigation3.1 Sample description , summary statistics , data sourcesLimited data availability , dataset consists unbalanced panel comprising 78 countries 2006 2020 .

Economic com-plexity includes breadth economy ’ exports knowledge-intensive . country produces many products countries pro-duce broad range productive capacities . Conversely , country produces products many countries make likely productive capabilities . Therefore , economic complexity crucial factor help explain entrepreneurship new firm creation . country takes innovative activities , likely produce broad range products , making complex . Thus , complex economies generate opportunities start business venture innovate . time , need higher funding start new busi-ness . contrary , less complex economies produce fewer simpler products require lower funding levels create new businesses . regard , Nguyen et al .

However , new opportunities also mean higher competition uncer-tainty , beyond level economic complexity , higher competition might stop even discourage new business opportunities ( Nguyen et al . 2021 , p. 4 ) .According theoretical premises , countries low levels economic complexity presumably produce goods services require particularly complex technologies realized relatively low investments .

SGCF influence investment decisions toward new economic activities , indirectly , affect creation new firms . EMPAGR EMPIND economic variables account country ’ economic structure . every country , rates new business creation differ considerably sector , priori expectations regarding impact two shares creation new firms.CREDIT serves proxy financial development , higher levels finan-cial development expected facilitate creation new firms . Conversely , RIR measures cost capital , expected harm creation new firms.The socio-political variables study voice accountability index ( VAI ) size government index ( SGI ) . variables reflect social characteristics countries government policy environment . VAI comprises several indicators measure various aspects political process , civil liberties , political rights . indicators gauge extent citi-zens participate selecting governments . Higher values VAI expected foster better environment creating new firms . SGI based general government consumption spending percentage total consumption , transfers subsidies percentage GDP , government enterprises investment percentage total investment , top marginal tax rate . effect variable ambiguous since , one hand , larger governments may drain private resources could otherwise invested productive activities ( including new firms ) private sector . hand , public expenditures , public infrastructure education , may benefit country ’ overall productivity encourage private economic initiatives creation new firms.The socio-demographic variables study include HCI POP .

POP also positively affect creation new firms , captures role large home market.The variables TRADE , FDIPOP , INTERNET associated level country internationalization . TRADE almost invariably linked better economic opportunities , including creating new firms ; therefore , expected posi-tive impact . foreign direct investment , used nearly stud-ies mentioned , role needs clarification , forecasting effects complex.6 According World Bank “ Foreign direct investment net inflows investment acquire lasting management interest ( 10 per cent voting stock ) enterprise operating economy investor '' . Therefore , foreign direct investments refer direct investment equity flows reporting economy , strong reason believe could favor creation new firms . Regarding INTERNET , studies documented positive relationship internet connectivity aggregate measures economic progress ( Hjort Tian 2021 , p. 17 ) . example , Cariolle et al .

Analogously , Hjort Poulsen ( 2019 ) documented large significant increase net firm entry arrival submarine internet cables South Africa . generally , Alhassan ( 2023 ) found online services telecommunication infrastructure positively moderate association remittances entrepreneurship.The variables EDB DI capture institutional dimension . EDB score measures difficulty starting business country based gap performance regulatory best practices worldwide . higher score indicates better performance , positively affecting creation new firms . EDB also captures entrepreneurial capacity entrepreneurs , well business-friendly environ-ment characterized competitive market factors . DI measure country ’ degree democracy attempts quantify extent ideal democracy achieved . socially inefficient regulations rent-seeking activities less likely imposed democratic countries , expected higher DI , greater number new firms . According World Bank ( 2014 ) , strong correla-tion democratic institutions , respect human rights , better conditions business . However , relationship democracy creation new firms could complex . regard , Sima Huang ( 2023 , p. 2 ) claim “ ini-tial condition terms economic development crucial countries embark path faster economic growth democratization ” . find strong democra-cies ( defined democracies adequate economic development transition ) grow faster weak democracies ( defined democracies poor economic develop-ment transition ) .6 Authors ( 2022 ) , Ajide Osinubi ( 2022 ) , Cummings et al .

Economic Change Restructuring1 3In concluding section , important remember various coun-try-specific factors influence creation new firms , nearly impossible account . Including country-fixed effects allows controlling time-invariant country-specific factors , best way handle econo-metrically . Additionally , dividing sample homogeneous sub-samples complementary approach dealing country-specific heterogeneity arising unobserved factors . empirical analysis , employ strategies.3.5 Methodology econometric specificationOur dependent variable count variable takes non-negative integer val-ues linear regression models inappropriate since basic assumptions ordinary least squares model violated leading biased inconsistent coefficient estimates . Conversely , count data models Poisson negative binomial suitable empirical analysis ( Allison Waterman 2002 ; Cameron Trivedi 1986 ) . Figures 2 , 3 , 4 show distribution NLLC right-skewed total sample different sub-samples study . addition , likeli-hood ratio test LR2 reported regressions indicates NLLC over-dispersed ( i.e. , variance greater mean ) ; thus , Poisson regression model inap-propriate over-dispersion could result spurious significance coefficient estimates due underestimated standard errors ( Cameron Trivedi 1986 ; 2013 ) .7 contrary , negative binomial models allow over-dispersion separate parameterization dispersion parameter . Expressed terms log-likelihood function , negative binomial model takes following general form : yit dependent variable , x′it vector explanatory variables , possibly including unit time effects , α over-dispersion parameter , β vector coefficients , Γ gamma function . study , dependent variable number new limited liabilities companies ( ( NLLCit ) , exp ( x′it ) corresponds : country time , number new limited liabilities companies related real per capita remittances ( REMit−1 ) , economic complexity index ( ECIit−1 ) , interaction term ( REMit−1 × ECIit−1 ) , set control varia-bles z�it−1 described Sect. 3.4 . cope possible reverse causality issues , explanatory variables lagged time t-1 .

Finally , 55th centile , effect REM NLLC becomes negative statistically significant . finding supports hypothesis role ECI impact REM NLLC . Countries low levels ECI produce goods services new firms established relatively low initial investments provided remittances abroad . Conversely , countries high levels ECI produce goods services new firms require high initial investments . circumstances , unlikely single remittances alone provide sufficient resources start new firms.To understand practical implications results , 5th centile ECI , increase real per capita remittances one dollar would increase num-ber new firms 3069 units . Note one-dollar increase real per capita remittances could represent significant surge . provide concrete example , let us consider Mali , 5th centile ECI final year sample ( 2020 ) . Mali population approximately 19.1 million year , real per capita remittances 0.48 dollars . Therefore , one-dollar increase real per capita remittances would represent 200 % growth , resulting $ 19.2 million increase total real remittances , would help create 3069 new firms . year , Mali real GDP ( constant US dollars ) 15,830 million , $ 19.2 million increase total real remittances would equivalent 0.12 % real GDP.Moving beyond 5th centile ECI , 10th centile , number new firms would increase 2498 , 15th centile , number new firms would increase 1988 . statistically significant effect observed 15th 55th centile .

Panel ( ) Fig . 7 shows average marginal effect REM new firms ’ creation , though increasing , negative . least two possible explanations result . first remittances Africa mainly used consumption rather investment purposes . United Nations Economic Commission Africa ( UNECA 2005 ; 2006 ) reports around 80 % remittances Africa used consumption schooling . Thus , remittances might contribute increasing human capital accumulation schooling , use spur investment new firm creation seems residual . second explanation remittances sent Africa lowest across continents . seen subSect . 3.1 , real per capita remittances received African countries 14 % received European countries , 18 % compared Latin American Caribbean countries , 22 % compared Asian coun-tries .
