Introduction study whether ability country export diversified less ubiquitous goods ( therefore greater economic complexity ) reduces probability suffering fiscal crisis . rely survival analysis assess probability comprehensive dataset fiscal distress episodes 172 countries 1 1995 2020 . answer yes , broadly significantly . point estimate effect baseline model indicates increase one-point economic complexity index Hidalgo Haussmann ( 2009 ) reduces probability experiencing fiscal distress episode approximately half ( 46 % -57 % depending preferred specification estimation method ) . probability 39 % 46 % emerging markets considered , reaches 73 % assumption constant proportional hazards relaxed duration analysis . one-point increment high bar country , since managed improve economic complexity index order magnitude period analyzed2 . case , half variation recorded multiple times years , quite emerging economies matter decade less , making realistic policy objective safeguard fiscal stability medium term . especially relevant emerging low-income developing countries , show section 4.1 , suffer disproportionately fiscal vulnerability . estimates robust controlling institutional factors , rule law regulatory quality , also show high predictive power future fiscal distress countries , orthogonal effect economic complexity ; control macroeconomic indicators typical literature sudden stops sovereign debt pricing , real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth , investment , inflation , terms trade consumption ; control natural resource rents , debt-GDP ratio , implicit interest paid debt given year , even controlling fiscal balances ( among variables ) . Indeed , across specifications , economic complexity institutional factors retain statistical economic significance important contributors explaining future periods fiscal distress . 1 80.81 % emerging low-income developing countries 19.19 % advanced economies . 2 Notorious examples Brazil ( 0.84 0.03 ) ; China ( 0.32 1.30 ) ; Korea ( 1.04 1.95 ) ; Malasya ( 0.42 1.12 ) ; Romania ( 0.41 1.27 ) ; Uganda ( -1.22 -0.47 ) Vietnam ( -0.92 0.18 ) . Panama managed go 0.00 1.00 1997 2012 5 years . 3 first propose quantify effect economic complexity probability suffering fiscal crisis ( indeed , best knowledge , also first directly model survival probability country experiencing fiscal crisis ) . However , economic mechanisms effect takes place multiple solidly documented previous literature . country level , higher complexity shown associated higher future economic growth ( e.g . Hidalgo Haussmann , 2009 ; Haussmann et al. , 2014 ; Tachella et al . 2018 ; Nepelski De Prato , 2020 ) . Furthermore , growth path led higher complexity tends also stable , complexity also shown associated lower output volatility ( Güneri , B . & Yalta , 2021 ) . micro level , compelling evidence higher level complexity company ’ product basket associated reduced fluctuations output ( Maggioni et al. , 2016 ) . Higher growth lower volatility combination naturally associated stabilization fiscal budgets ability successfully navigate turbulent times without enduring fiscal distress episodes . contrary , lack productive diversification detrimental macroeconomic stability general fiscal stability particular . one hand , countries rely heavily production ubiquitous basic goods incomes fluctuate prices goods international markets ( Deaton , 1999 ; Lo et al. , 2022 ) . hand , countries dependent sectors tourism vulnerable global economic cycles lead substantial reduction tourism demand times low global economic activity ( Aronica et al. , 2021 ) . also vulnerable situations one due pandemic , caused global demand tourism drop sharply 2020 . Moreover , economy ’ ability produce complex goods , relies complex networks bring different types know-how capabilities together , may lead resilient external shocks thus , might help reduce risk facing fiscal crisis . Making comparison investments financial assets , diversified asset portfolio allows risk mitigated , generating stable income investors time . way , housing complex production structures allows countries stable incomes governments face less fluctuating tax revenues . Following line reasoning complexity could expected associated lower cost sovereign debt , lower risk premium . seems case according Özmen ( 2019 ) , shows 4 , controlling relevant macroeconomic factors , global factors institutional indicators , economic complexity significant negative effect spreads Credit Default Swaps , emerging advanced economies . study also contributes recent literature fiscal crises developed measures use proxy fiscal distress episodes , explained detail section 2 ( i.e. , Medas et al. , 2018 , Moreno et al. , 2022 ) . research question differs extant literature , since concerned forecasting fiscal crises , using large set variables , estimating determinants probability entering episode fiscal distress years ahead , particular , evaluating role economic complexity source long-term fiscal resiliency countries . also contribute subject showing short run , complexity institutions less fixed , better keep track interest paid countries debt , excessively focus debt GDP ratio , even significant explain probability suffering fiscal crisis . result line recent claims literature debt/GDP ratio shows time-varying country-dependent effect borrowing costs , making difficult use anchor establish fiscal rules ( Furmer Summers , 2020 ; Caselli et al. , 2022 ) . contribution timely , since current macroeconomic discussions policymakers academics focusing fiscal imbalances , fears effect growing public debt balances may fiscal macroeconomic stability , effects higher interest rates debt burdens environment high persistent inflation ( Caselli et al. , 2022 ) . Interest fiscal issues supported fact sovereign debt levels around world reporting historic highs . pandemic created unprecedented fiscal response total resources assigned attend globally reached $ 12.5 trillion , according IMF ( Reuters , 2022 ) . spending needed address social , health economic impacts crisis , vast expenditure caused profound deterioration fiscal balances . Implementation support packages led large fiscal deficits , resulted high financing needs partially covered countries taking additional debt . results clear policy implications . established strong link economic complexity fiscal resilience , policy challenge improve complexity . evolve ? government encourage emergence complex products economy point resilient fiscal results ? directly address 5 questions , complexity literature informs us extensively . traditional approach considers complexity along “ relatedness ” . Relatedness measures “ easy ” enter activity specific country region , former offers measure value activity . Activities rank high relatedness complexity best “ low-hanging fruit ” diversification therefore , define boundaries efficient diversification frontier , maximizes complexity minimizes difficulty entering activity ( Haussmann et al. , 2014 ; Balland et al. , 2018 ; Hidalgo , 2021 ) . Nevertheless , approach complexity subject criticisms since simplistic suboptimal ( Alshamsi et al. , 2018 ) . Recognizing limitations , recent work complexity emphasized , ideally , economies focus relatively unrelated connected activities window opportunity opens intermediate levels development , “ leapfrogging ” intermediate technologies thus intermediate stages development ( Lee Ki , 2017 ) . Ultimately , complexity related growth knowledge , thus policy efforts also interested knowledge diffusion strategies ( see Jaffe et al. , 1993 ; Audretsch Feldman , 1996 , 2004 ) . Balland et al . ( 2022 ) , supporting economic upgrading building complex capabilities better development strategy aiming produce high-priced goods . latter goods exempt rapid changes characterized commodity markets , result changing market conditions , regulations , customer preferences , wars , pandemics . reason , developing capabilities produce complex products natural path ensure long-term growth , also ensure greater fiscal stability , particularly face large global shocks recently experienced global economy . rest document organized follows . section 2 present methods , section 3 data sources , section 4 main results . Section 5 concludes . also online Appendix showing robustness checks additional descriptive tables . 6 2 . Methodology section describe main variables , economic complexity fiscal distress , alongside economic intuition . also briefly introduce survival analysis framework estimate probability entering fiscal crisis , conditional covariates . 2.1 . Economic Complexity use Hidalgo Haussmann ’ ( 2009 ) index Economic Complexity ( ECI ) , regularly updated web page Economic Complexity Atlas Harvard ’ Growth Lab . According authors ( see Hidalgo 2021 , Balland et al. , 2022 ) economic complexity indicators measure economic capacity . indicators based dimensionality reduction techniques known Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) principal component analysis , interestingly also popular asset pricing , actuarial science recently macroeconomics big data . Economic complexity metrics interpreted factor-decompositions large network export products 3 . reasoning underlies Hausmann Hidalgo ’ , ( 2009 ) indicator production complex goods requires wide set diverse exclusive capabilities . Therefore , complex products easily reproducible anywhere , i.e. , less ubiquitous , general rule produced fewer countries . countries considered framework complex basis sufficiently large endowments diverse exclusive capabilities . 2.2 . Fiscal Crises follow Medas et al . ( 2018 ) Moreno et al . ( 2022 ) define fiscal distress episode . authors define broad sense , period sensitive budgetary distress , results government taking exceptional measures . use authors ’ series 1995 2015 criteria defining fiscal crisis complete series 2016 2020 . criteria four : 1 ) Credit events . fiscal crisis triggered debt ’ service paid due , creditor incurs type loss , including debt restructuring . 2 ) Exceptionally large external official funding . country receives significant financial support IMF European Union . 3 ) Implicit breach internal public debt . , either : ( ) periods high inflation ( generally associated 3 concept economic complexity limited export goods . manifests ( see Hidalgo , 2021 , discussion ) . 7 monetary funding budget ) ; ( ii ) accumulation internal arrears . 4 ) Market confidence loss , associated extreme market pressures represented : ( ) loss access market , sovereign defaults , interruption bond issuance ; ( ii ) large borrowing costs sovereign yield spikes . 2.3 . Survival Analysis main objective evaluate relation economic complexity episodes fiscal distress . According definition fiscal crises , dependent variable binary , taking value one period fiscal distress identified taking value zero otherwise , country . therefore follow probability approach . general way constructing probabilistic approach using hazard duration model . duration analysis , dependent variable 𝑇 , represents time takes something happen . random variable non-negative either discrete continuous . Duration analysis done either following fully parametric approach semi-parametric approach . determine approaches best follow , researchers use non-parametric analysis raw data . results shown first part fourth section . Cases preliminary analysis indicates non-parametric hazard function highly non-monotonic provide evidence use parametric functions representing duration normal times period fiscal distress occurs . cases , Proportional Hazards ( PH ) Model Cox ( 1972 ) preferred . proportional hazards specification , hazard rate written 𝜆 ( 𝑡 , 𝑋 , 𝛽 , 𝜆0 ) = 𝜙 ( 𝑋 , 𝛽 ) 𝜆0 ( 𝑡 ) , [ 1 ] 𝜆0 baseline hazard . Note effect time hazard rate captured completely baseline hazard . One common specification function 𝜙 , followed paper , 𝜙 ( 𝑋 , 𝛽 ) = exp⁡ ( 𝑋⁡𝛽 ) , 𝑋 vector covariates 𝛽 corresponding vector parameters estimated . specification , 𝜕𝑙𝑜𝑔 [ 𝜆 ( ⋅ ) ] 𝜕𝑋𝑘= 𝛽𝑘 , [ 2 ] 𝑘 . Therefore , coefficients interpreted constant , proportional effect corresponding covariate conditional probability completing spell . 8 particular case study , completing spell associated moment country enters period fiscal distress . case specifications model baseline hazard explicitly making use particular parametric model , estimation done method maximum likelihood . baseline hazard explicitly modeled , conventional estimation method partial likelihood estimation , developed Cox ( 1972 ) . key point method observation ratio hazards two individuals depends covariates depend duration . censoring , censored spells contribute log-likelihood function entering denominator uncensored observations ( instance case advanced countries sample ) . Censored observations enter numerator log-likelihood function . Ties durations handled several different methods . paper , ties handled applying exact , Efron , Breslow methods . try three robustness purposes . also compare baseline results PH model results accelerated failure time model ( AFT ) . AFT models depart different assumption PH models , whereas PH model covariates act multiplicatively hazard , AFT model covariates act multiplicatively time . 3 . Data rely comprehensive dataset fiscal distress related macroeconomic , financial , institutional factors spanning , emerging ( including low income developing countries ) advanced economies . dataset annual frequency 1995 2020 , properly accounts sufficient periods fiscal distress related episodes financial macroeconomic turmoil global economy . first set results ( section 4.1 ) , take account complexity controls , consider 172 countries4 . 139 countries labeled emerging economies ( 80.81 % total ) , 33 countries advanced ( 19.19 % total ) . countries 96 place fiscal rule end period , amounts 55.81 % total ( see Table A3 online Appendix ) . 4 full list names countries details consulted Table A1 Appendix . 9 Table 1 .

Proxy variables institutional quality given country depict high correlation , e.g . government effectiveness , regulatory quality , rule law , control corruption , etc . also almost perfect correlations aggregate demand proxies , domestic absorption real consumption . reason usually select one variable within group conduct given regression results sections . case , including one several variables change results regarding effect economic complexity ( see Table A5 online Appendix ) . 4 . Results main results divided two sections : first one work full data set ( even including countries lack information economic complexity covariates ) conduct preliminary survival analysis . second part , estimate proportional hazard model several robustness checks , including restricting dataset emerging economies , changing estimation method handle ties data , fitting accelerated failure time model rather PH model . main results always hold . 4.1 . Survival estimates Regarding dependent variable , i.e. , fiscal crises , handle two different types events : Event 1 refers fiscal distress episodes , Event 0 episodes non-fiscal crisis . 1694 observations event “ crisis ” dataset 1754 observations event “ non-crisis ” . observations associated 478 individuals . principle , individuals countries , country contribute several fiscal crisis episodes . average duration country enters fiscal crisis event 4.9 years , average number years country non-crisis state equals 13.29 years . 11 maximum number years cases 26 , since sample period runs 1995 2020 . means two things : countries never faced episode fiscal distress sample period ( mostly advanced economies ) least one country started 1995 without fiscal crisis , stayed fiscal crisis whole sample , entering 2020 ( country Chile ) . minimum number years two fiscal crises 2 construction , reason minimum Event 1 sample 2 ( information repeated Table A3 online Appendix ) . Figure 1 .

Panels F shows non-parametric hazard full sample , emerging advanced economies , respectively . top Figure 1 , Panels C , observe Kaplan-Meier estimates different individuals survivorship function . Panel noticed significant share individuals enter crisis year 2 , also large number individuals enter crisis episode even period 26 . 12 Panel B figure differentiate advanced emerging countries . differences survival ( crisis ) probabilities obvious , reason , perform two separate analyses next section : 1 ) main analysis including whole sample countries 2 ) restricted analysis using emerging markets . observed figure , probability surviving ( i.e . entering episode fiscal stress ) advanced economies much higher . also conduct preliminary assessment fiscal rules way mitigate crises . Panel C , seems fiscal rules move upwards survivorship function countries implement , difference large , need conduct inference . Indeed , formalize graphical inspection conducted formal statistical test ( log-rank test ) compares two functions two cases : expected , log-rank test indicates survivorship emerging advanced countries statistically different test inconclusive case fiscal rule ( p value equal 0.07 , means null equality rejected 10 % 5 % ) . latter case , also possible bias due fact emerging countries tend implement fiscal rules frequently advanced countries , thus , order prevent Simpson ’ paradox emerging , necessary compare survivorship functions emerging advanced economics different groups . advanced economies , log-rank statistic difference implementing implementing fiscal rule 0.1 ( p-value=0.7 ) , 1.7 ( p-value=0.2 ) emerging economies . cases , null equality rejected , meaning fiscal rules ’ implementation reduce probability future fiscal crisis . reason fiscal rules considered following analysis . panels F Figure 1 show no-parametric ( Epanechnikov ) kernel estimates hazard , useful determine whether monotonic function ( i.e . exponential , Weibull ) would suffice model duration fiscal distress episodes observed , would appropriate include covariates form proportional hazards model . Panel shows kernel whole sample , Panel C emerging economies , Panel F advanced economies . observed , case advanced economies monotonic function could fitted data , case emerging countries , consequently total sample , non-monotonic behavior significant merits use sophisticated survival models hazard . 13 Noticeably , growing risk end period entering fiscal crisis state emerging countries ( also total sample , emerging countries included ) . contrasts case advanced economies hazard tends disappear end sample . observation justifies approach subject confirms importance policy debate understanding sources possible increments probability living fiscal crisis , especially emerging countries . 4.2 .

Indeed , theoretical model Mehrotra Sergeyev ( 2021 ) shows conditions sustainability closely tied debt GDP ratio metrics commonly used empirical literature ( Reinhart Rogoff , 2010 ) . results echo Furman Summers ( 2020 ) questioning utility debt-to-GDP thresholds anchors , least warn researchers policymakers interested ratios , always considering effect interest paid assessing safe-thresholds . Finally , note effect economic complexity seems overestimated different institutional control used ( particular , voice accountability last column ) effect increased use instead rule law ( model 7 ) . Nevertheless , even including institutional indicators dataset effect economic complexity never falls bellow 47 % ( see Table A5 online Appendix ) . 4.3 . hazard emerging markets Acknowledging documented differences emerging advanced economies section 4.1 , estimated set models reported Table 2 , using information emerging markets , reduces effective sample size individuals 234 202 .
