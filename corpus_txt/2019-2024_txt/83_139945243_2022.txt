Finally , discuss although identified strategies important contributions , far easy apply practice . ( Good ) Reason Institutional Complexity Healthcare OrganizationsThe complexity hospitals Waitzberg colleagues related multiple objectives1 frequently described research . Already 20 years ago , hospitals pictured consisting different worlds , different orders.2 However , differences culture , values ways looking key issues seen main problem , since hospitals organizations need able meet many different – sometimes competing – demands . differences also encompassed different views accountability/autonomy , systematization clinical work , teamwork power differentials , made different worlds poorly integrated . lack integration main problem . worlds tended held separately different actors preferred one worlds thought worlds problematic.2 Currently , institutional logics framework , Waitzberg colleagues relate discussion,1 often used explain complexity hospitals . institutional logics capture , way thinking goes beyond organization . Institutional logics guide social actions providing assumptions values ways AnderssonInternational Journal Health Policy Management , 2022 , 11 ( 10 ) , 2346–2348 2347interpret organizational reality.3 Thus , different institutional logics provide different meaning values , different interpretations reality , mean give different steering signals situation . Institutional complexity means many different institutional logics co-exist without able dominate.4 inevitable part managing hospitals need perspective logics simultaneously sustainable well-functioning healthcare . logics “ good ” prioritizing important aspects , none alone ensure well-functioning healthcare organization time . institutional complexity actually inevitable well-functioning healthcare , need able deal complexity.5 Complexity Increased Healthcare OrganizationsBut institutional complexity high large organization ? business organization thousands employees inevitably mean different co-existing competing institutional logics , organization less complex hospital ? different competing logics organization , business organization likely one logic dominant , often business logic . causes high complexity public organization , especially hospitals , different logics relatively equal strength . logic dominate . mentioned previously , important prerequisite sustainable well-functioning healthcare organization time , also causes high institutional complexity5 need balance different perspectives6 ( logics ) every single situation.However , hospitals always complex govern . 1960s 1970s , hospitals less complex one logic totally dominant : medical logic physician profession . Since , major growth managerialism hospitals.7 countries New Public Management ( NPM ) 8 influential , growth managerialism represented NPM . Today , immense criticism managerialism NPM hospital management many countries , perhaps criticism better acknowledge unsustainable conditions healthcare organizations managerialism NPM , professional logic ruled game . professional logic “ good ” quality development , weakness lack resource restrictions ; always possible better . whole healthcare sector governed ideal , gave enormous expansion,9 implied problems financing healthcare growth continued . Hospitals obviously also needed resource perspective . became one reason growth managerialism beginning research later came call NPM : public organizations imitated private business terms organize manage organizations . Managerialism NPM made management logic stronger , thus increased institutional complexity hospitals new logic exchange existing logics , added them.10 paradox managerialism make hospitals governable instead increased complexity.11 currently state healthcare organizations : institutional complexity high . . managerialism alone would ruling logic , would probably give healthcare system citizens would appreciate . hand , professional logic alone would ruling logic , healthcare would challenges finance activities . , complex , complex , everyone satisfied ? Pretend Complex Instead Acknowledging ComplexityThe main problem complexity people prefer predictability complexity.12 people prefer believe ability different management concept solve problems healthcare organizations.13 also hospitals become fragmented systems . Fragmentation common way deal complexity ( , accurately , turn blind eye towards complexity ) , complex system reduced one logic instead several competing ones , system appears predictable . problem since complex , actions based one logic lot unintended consequences.14 many studies managers physicians fail acknowledge institutional complexity healthcare , Waitzberg colleagues ’ contribution instead focused perhaps rare occasion succeed reconciling balancing competing logics strategies use situations . important since paves way better deal institutional complexity healthcare . Waitzberg et al1 ( p. 8 ) identified three different strategies : “ ( 1 ) reconciliation economic clinical considerations increasing efficiency , possible situations inherent conflict objectives . case activity-based payment incentivizes proper treatment ; ( 2 ) mitigation dilemmas reshaping managerial practices , treatment paths coding ; ( 3 ) balancing considerations reframing focus decision-making bigger units analysis. ” strategies constitute important contribution , would consider even general common ground condition strategies : need frequent high-quality interaction different actors . first strategy acknowledges even two logics conflict , conflicting situations . Identifying situations conflict obvious first step , requires interaction different actors often adhere mainly one logics.5,11 Consequently , practice , interaction precondition reconciling logics way . two strategies require change , either managerial practices focus , neither would possible without interaction . require in-depth understanding managerial practices clinical work , rare single actor possess usually requires interaction different actors . Waitzberg colleagues also touched upon perhaps easier said done , describing fragile Andersson International Journal Health Policy Management , 2022 , 11 ( 10 ) , 2346–23482348balance opposing forces logics . Even people acknowledged complexity , preference predictability disappear . strategy fruitful balancing opposing logics destroy balance taken far . Consequently , future research could continue route set Waitzberg et al ( 1 ) investigating interaction condition identified strategies could supported creating arenas roles support interaction15 ( 2 ) making successful balancing sustainable ; example , creating organizational structures support balance different interest perspectives.6 hospital organizations complex , let complex instead learn deal complexity , similar Waitzberg et al did.Ethical issuesNot applicable.Competing interestsAuthor declares competing interests .
