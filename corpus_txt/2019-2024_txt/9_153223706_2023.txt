However , large scale changes continually occurredduring Earth history , periods glaciation , widespread persistent volcanic activity , variations Earth ’ orbit axial tilt , changes distribution continents andoceans affected global ocean currents atmospheric circulation patterns . recentyears , witnessing global warming climate changes unprecedented overcenturies millennia . know paleoclimate data current multi-decadal ratesof change global mean surface temperature highest observed past twothousand years ( Pages 2k Consortium ( 2019 ) ) ; global mean sea level rise lastcentury faster previous three thousand years ( IPCC ( 2021 ) ) ; morestrikingly rate increase CO2 concentrations last hundred years oneorder magnitude higher highest rate increase observed previous twohundred thousand years ( Marcott et al . ( 2014 ) ) .Although total greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) concentration atmosphere about0.05 % ( excluding water vapor ) , seemingly negligible fraction , shown theactual increase global temperatures correlated increase GHGs concentration ( IPCC ( 2021 ) ) . Furthermore , high evidence actual increase GHGsatmospheric stock caused human activities : emissions greenhouse gases the1.1 climate change problem 4atmosphere energy production use , well industrial processes , agriculturalactivities deforestation among important factors.Human impact climate system traced back industrial revolutions . Theuse machines powered cheaper fossil energy sources industrial production andtransportation , increased connectivity , innovations organization productionwere essential create virtuous circle increasing supply demand , new technologiesand innovations led decrease production costs , growth demand forgoods creation new jobs , turn stimulated new innovations development.Nations underwent industrialization witnessed sharp surge material prosperity , often expressed hockey-stick growth GDP per capita.1The industrial revolutions brought technological innovations , alsoradical changes economy society : capitalist economic system , whichthe production undertaken firms machines use labor force employees , capitalist society , minority capitalists means production andhas largest share wealth majority offer workforce , born . Individualism , competition , pursuit profit , wealth accumulation placed heart newsocial value system.Although several changes occurred since first industrial revolution , core char-acteristics survived till today : permanent technological progress , assessmentof well-being living standards materialistic measures , recent belief thateconomic growth necessary increase general well-being . Therefore , capitalisteconomy problem climate change expressed finding way avoid impactson environment still maintaining economic growth . Although work use theeconomic growth measure policy performance , mostappropriate criteria evaluating policies . GDP include importantfactors contributing well-being people , free time environmental socialquality . However , even willing give economic growth , climate change remainsan exceptional challenge societies : simply turn factories stopglobal warming . Materialistic needs unavoidable , example , food production notbe interrupted . Moreover , materialistic needs depend social contest , case offlights . general terms , climate change problem formulated wereduce impact , avoid worst consequences climate change avoiding economicand social crisis.1See example https : //ourworldindata.org/grapher/historys-hockey-stick-gross-domestic-product-per-capita-using-the-ratio-scale-19901.1 climate change problem 5Climate change involves different physical phenomena global warming , sea levelrise , rainfall pattern shift , rise extreme weather events frequency , etc . Climate impactsare equally distributed among countries , cost mitigation felton short medium term , benefits manifest long run . Impactsdo manifest place GHGs emissions generated historicallyWestern nations contributed GHGs concentration increase ( IPCC ( 2021 ) ) .Therefore , climate change problem global problem involves coordination amongparties different economic geopolitical interests , historical responsibilities andgeopolitical power.In order respond climate change threat different international treaty frame-work established . 1988 , Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change ( IPCC ) established United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) WorldMeteorological Organization ( WMO ) tasks assessing scientific , technical andsocio-economic information relevant understanding risks climate change , toprovide advice policymakers . 1992 , United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change ( UNFCCC ) established objective stabilizing greenhousegas concentrations atmosphere level would prevent dangerous anthropogenicinterference climate system . 1997 , Kyoto Protocol adopted , aimedto reduce greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change . protocol establishedbinding emission reduction targets developed countries . Finally , 2015 Parisagreement adopted , aims limit global warming well 2 degreesCelsius pre-industrial levels , pursue efforts limit temperature increaseto 1.5 degrees Celsius . According agreement , parties ( nations signatories theagreement ) regularly compile national greenhouse gas inventories reporting theirGHGs emissions , submit Nationally Determined Contributions , isthe announced realized targets plans pursue Paris agreement goals.To date , many nations committed achieve net-zero emissions 2050 , thesepledges covering 70 % global GHGs emissions ( IEA ( 2021 ) ) . Nonetheless , according UNEP emission gap report ( UNEP ( 2021 ) ) , current National DeterminedContributions Paris agreement signatories sufficient avoid global warminggreater 3°C 2100.Policies judged using knowledge empirical studies theoretical models.It argued climate change problem calls radical change approachused think economy : general equilibrium theory complexity economics ( see example Farmer et al . ( 2015 ) ; Lamperti Roventini ( 2022 ) ; Roos ( 2023 ) ) . will1.2 climate economy complex systems 6show next section viewing climate economy complex systemshas important implications formulation problem , well choice theinstruments ( models ) used judge design climate policies.1.2 climate economy complex systemsComplex systemsComplex systems everywhere world , societies atmosphere theEarth , Internet cells constitute bodies . Due transverse nature , study complex systems involves many disciplines , contributing ownscope , theoretical definitions methodology . , precise commonlyaccepted definition complex system . Nevertheless , common features almostall definitions allow understand term . complex system system composedby usually large number heterogeneous elements interact , often non-linearly , witheach environment operate . Complex systems generaldifficult treat analytical solvable models . Even possible write aset equations evolution variables representing state system , isdifficult impossible solve analytically system . Complex systems require use ofnon-linear models , out-of-equilibrium descriptions computer simulations.A non-linear system one future state related previous states toeventual external forcings non-linear transformation involving squares productbetween previous states external forcings . common sense definition , inspiredby properties non-linear systems , non linear systems , small changes inpart system external forcing result radical changes evolutionof system . Non-linear systems often characterized high sensitivity initialconditions , irreversibility , hysteresis , path-dependence phase transitions . means thatthe evolution system depends previous history , system overcometo abrupt sudden changes internal external small changes bedifficult impossible reverse occurred change.An important feature complex systems emergence . systems , behavior ofthe system encoded properties elements , emerges result thelocal interaction elements . Relevant examples fish school birds flockingbehavior . Fish schools formed top-down , , one fish groupof fishes ordering others behave . fish simply watches nearby fish adjusts1.2 climate economy complex systems 7its speed changes speed neighbours . enough fishes eventually thefish school emerges.Elements complex systems often organized structures different levels scales : elements divided groups whithin individuals behave similarly . groups areformed , influence influenced global pattern well individual behavior.Social communities examples coherent structures . Individuals belonging toa community similar behave similarly , similar representations world , share system values judgments . Communities splitted smallercommunities . Community rules regulate interactions individuals among thecommunity individuals belonging communities . However , new ideas froma small group community change radically whole community . reasonwhy complex systems effectively studied purely reductionist purely holisticapproaches . fundamental microscopic laws global behaviorcan deduced , since global pattern emerges interactions encoded inthe components . time , behavior elements solely determined bythe system , implement certain functionality , global behavior continuallyaffected adaptation changing behavior elements.Another important aspect complex systems related power laws distributions ormore general fat-tailed distributions . Often properties constituents , like incomeof economic agents , occurrence certain events distributed according powerlaws distributions . implies high degree heterogeneity system , example , referring income distribution nation , distribution power law aremany individuals income roughly equal average income individualsthat income orders magnitude greater average income . theoccurrence extreme events roughly forbidden uniform , Gaussians similardistributions , expected heavy-tailed ones . Power laws distributions related toanother characteristic complex systems , talk useful use theoryof complex networks . elements system represented nodes , interactionsbetween couple elements represented links connecting nodes . number oflinks node called degree . One important characterization networksis understand degree distribution . shown large number realsystem degree distributed according power law distribution ( Albert et al . ( 1999 ) ; Faloutsos et al . ( 1999 ) ; Huberman Adamic ( 1999 ) ) . , real networks thereare many nodes degree similar average degree nodes , termed hubs , degree several order magnitude greater average degree . occurrence1.2 climate economy complex systems 8of hubs connected organizing principles according network forms.Indeed , links nodes established random , degree distributed moreuniformly hubs occur.2 presence hubs connected different propertiesof real networks . Real networks show enhanced robustness random removal nodes withrespect random lattice networks ( Albert et al . ( 2000 ) ) . , lattices randomnetworks break disconnected pieces fraction nodes thresholdfraction strictly lower one removed , break real network necessary toremove almost components . mainly due role hubs : difficultfor hub randomly removed fraction hubs negligible , guaranteenetwork connection thanks high number links . However , hubs responsiblefor fragility real network target attacks . nodes removed starting fromthose highest degree , fraction removed nodes necessary break downthe network low far one . random networks instead , target attacks haveroughly effect random attacks since degree homogeneously distributedamong nodes hubs . Without explicitly using language network theorywe state , often complex systems exhibit robustness random fluctuations , butshow fragility events affecting functional parts.Elements real complex system live operate physical environment , interactwith . However , environment individual physical environment , butit constituted also example structures present systems , networks ofdifferent relations existing elements , set behaviors elements , andso . Individuals try adapt environment changes , , theychange environment . feedback loop connecting evolution individualsand environment : elements environment co-evolve.Finally , want mention another property complex systems relevant climatechange problem , complex systems said `` edge chaos '' . Thoughthe notion formally defined precise , generally meant system atthe edge chaos one ( parameters ) regulating dynamics system close toa critical value beyond system becomes chaotic . Systems edge chaos arein zone order chaos . response change external conditions canrespond transitioning chaotic phase result profound structural changes thesystem . Eventually system return orderly phase , adapted new environmentalconditions.2Random assignation links fixed number nodes generate random network , like theErdos-Renyi graph , degree follows Poisson distribution.1.2 climate economy complex systems 9The climate complex system.The Earth climate system usually divided five main components , termed `` spheres '' : theatmosphere , composed gases surrounding Earth held gravity ; hydrosphere , including liquid water earth , oceans lakes rivers , tounderground water ; lithosphere , solid outermost layer Earth ; cryosphere , includes ice Earth surface , glaciers ice caps sea ice ; finallythe biosphere , constituted living matter Earth.3All components considered complex systems turn , since theyshare characteristics complex systems cited previous section . example , atmosphere oceans exhibit non linear behavior since described byNavier-Stockes equations , non-linear partial differential equations used describethe motion fluids . Non-linear behavior characterizes also spheres , thebiosphere : small changes population size species bottom food chaincan huge impacts whole system chain reaction effects.Also interactions spheres non-linear character . Spheres exchangewith energy , heat , radiation mechanical energy , matter , forexample biogeochemical cycles volcanic eruptions . Considering hydrologicalcycle , hydrosphere biosphere give water atmosphere evaporation , water goes atmosphere spheres precipitation . Smallchanges atmospheric temperatures significant impacts hydrological cyclesince warming increase evaporation rate increase water vapor atmosphericconcentration leading warming via greenhouse gas effect . Interactions betweenspheres captured exchange energy matter . sphere , partof , considered border environmental condition spheres . Theborder condition sphere static influenced turn sphere dynamics.For example , ocean free surface constitutes border condition atmosphere andit continually perturbed winds general affected evolution theatmosphere.The climate system forced flux energy comes Sun . Earthin turn emits energy space form long-wave radiation . incoming solarradiation part reflected part absorbed surface Earth , part thelong-wave radiation emitted Earth absorbed GHGs atmosphere , and3However , classifications Earth climate system include additional spheres , asthe Sixth Sphere framework , includes anthroposphere , Earth System Science framework thatcomprises five spheres mentioned well components magnetosphere.1.2 climate economy complex systems 10though part emitted GHGs , net balance less radiation emitted intospace . Due curvature , surface earth heated unevenly sun : energyper unit time surface area maximum equator minimum poles . Theglobal circulation pattern atmosphere oceans distributes heat theequator poles . Circulation patterns driven differential heating Earthsurface , Earth rotation , pressure salinity gradients among main factors , andare influenced interactions spheres . general , climate system varies ona large range spatial temporal scales . means coherent structures verydifferent size life time coexist interact , circulation patternin Hadley cells , cyclones vortexes , wind patterns city . Therefore , globalpattern circulation result external forcing , emerges interactionsbetween spheres shaped constant emergence disappearance coherentstructures scales interactions.As mentioned introduction , although climate remained relatively stable formillions years , changed dramatically past , going glacial eras thetemperature low enough allow glaciation poles , warming periods noice present Earth . ice age , glacial periods , characterized cold temperaturesand advance ice poles towards equator , alternate shorter interglacialperiods , ice cover retreats . Changes occurred external well asinternal variability , due non-linearity climate system , differentfeedback mechanisms , positives negatives , affect climate system evolution , amplifying reducing external changes well internal fluctuations . Examples positivefeedback mentioned water vapor feedback ice-albedo feedback : anincrease temperature lead decrease ice covered surface leading decreaseof surface albedo , results increase temperature . long waveradiation feedback example negative feedback : warmer Earth increase emissionof long wave radiation lead decrease temperature.It therefore difficult determine climate response changes GHGs concen-tration , even difficult determine impacts climate response humansocieties . difficulty exacerbated presence components high inertia : even stop emitting GHGs , accumulated ocean continue heatthe atmosphere centuries millennia . Therefore , reduce uncertainty dataaccumulation , necessary observe climate systems periods much longer thantime span considered useful climate change mitigation.1.2 climate economy complex systems 11The climate system allows show another type problem , related data , canemerge analyzing complex systems , context climate models known '' parametrization problem '' ( see example Provenzale ( 2014 ) ) . Consider examplethe atmosphere . Since models include details target systems , aspatial temporal scale chosen . atmosphere divided large numberof parallelograms whose size determine spatial resolutions model . Inside eachparallelogram relevant variables , temperature , pressure , chemical composition , , assumed homogeneous . , equation fluid dynamics used evolvethe system . homogeneity assumption implies neglecting internal dynamics insideeach parallelogram , particular means assuming dynamics structureswhose typical size lesser one sides parallelogram dominated anddo influence macro dynamics parallelogram . Though climate models theinternal dynamics influence extent taken account parametrization , larger scale dynamics parallelogram supposed dominate lower scale , sinceparametrization expressed terms large scale variables lower scale variablesare excluded analysis . Since climate presents coherent structures scales , parametrization problem disappear improving resolution models.Increasing data storage capacity , increasing computational power development ofknew data processing techniques give hope increase understanding , progressivereduction uncertainties understanding climate , enough . recognizedby IPCC latest assessment report ( IPCC ( 2021 ) ) , progress made climatemodels respect time previous report modest , despite increasedspatial resolution new climate models . parametrization problem imposes us tounderstand better link elements system , link different scalesphenomena general , global pattern emerges system componentsbehavior.Adopting complex system approach describe climate system important im-plications climate change problem . First , problem involve fundamentaluncertainty , problem probabilities distributions certain variables orevents known . seen , processes affecting climate change , un-derstanding requires future observations centuries millennia . Moreover , newand data , increasing computational power guarantee alone reduction ofuncertainties , really need better understanding complex systems . Furthermore , sincecomplex systems uncomputable dynamics , faced possibilitythat uncertainties unavoidable all.1.2 climate economy complex systems 12If climate seen complex system , much easier accept idea climatechange involves numerous risks various magnitudes , including catastrophes . climatesystem interconnected components contribute maintain conditions support ourexistence . life based fragile system interconnected meta-stable states . Thenon-linear behavior climate imply small changes climate system beamplified numerous feedback mechanisms resulting global change humanlife supporting conditions severely affected even destroyed . climate system ischaracterized tipping points , therefore changes irreversible , bea global climate tipping point beyond actual global warming unstoppable ( Lenton et al . ( 2019 ) ) . context characterized high fundamental uncertainties theexistences risks leads preference cautious approaches dealing withclimate change.The economy complex system.The economy composed many heterogeneous agents , usually grouped institutionalsectors households , firms , banks , governments , interact incomplex ways , exchanging , among things , money , goods , services , work , financialproducts.As remarked Arthur ( 2021 ) , agents economy make decisions contextcharacterized fundamental uncertainty . First , know future states theworld . Second , result actions influenced actions others . Therefore , decision making process , agents account others make decisions.Decisions based expectations , complete perfect information , oftenassumed general equilibrium models . outcome decisions agents givesrise global pattern , determines success failure decision strategy insatisfying certain purpose . , agents try adapt others actions changing theirexpectations strategies , continuous feedback loop interaction expectationsformation actions.An illustrative example provided bubbles crashes occurring financialmarket . typical bubble form self-reinforcing process diffusion theexpectation increase price given asset ( see example , Arthur et al . ( 2018 ) ; Palmer et al . ( 1994 ) ) . enough people convinced price asset rise , purchase assets causes price asset rise , confirming initial expectationand causing belief spread people well , determining growth inpurchases , therefore price , asset question . process leads fast1.2 climate economy complex systems 13growth asset price , determining formation bubble . bubble eventuallyburst due similar mechanism : group people , convinced future drop price , sell holdings asset , causing slowdown decrease price . spreads theexpectation decrease price triggers sales , on.The economy shows non-linear behavior since small changes part system inthe environment trigger radical changes whole economy . relevant example the2007-2008 financial crisis , crisis US subprime mortgage market spreadto markets affected entire world economy ( Crotty ( 2009 ) ) . Crawford et al . ( 2009 ) present list damages involved markets , reporting examplethat US stock market recorded 1.3 trillion dollars wealth-loss single day.Another example relevant climate change problem credit sector . Boss et al . ( 2004 ) analyzed Austrian interbank market , showing resulting network , whichlinks banks identified liabilities directed debtor creditor , ascale-free network , power-laws in- out-degree distribution exponent 1.7 and3.1 , respectively . mentioned , scale-free network robust randomfailure , fragile target attacks . Moreover , scale-free networks spread adisease , identified bank failure context , occur even epidemicstart one bank failure ( Barrat et al . ( 2008 ) ) . However , direct transmission betweenbanks way losses defaults propagate credit sector ; according Hellwig ( 2009 ) , losses due credit constraints non financial firm canfeedback banking system . Crisis financial system emerge endogenously andcan feed-back real economy , leading prolonged crisis ( Riccetti et al . ( 2015 , 2016,2018 ) ) .Climate transition risks ( Monasterolo ( 2020 ) ) , i.e. , risks deriving way transi-tion realized , strictly related financial contagion . Fossil fuel reserves , machines andinfrastructures search , extraction distribution fossil fuels currently evaluatedwithout assessment climate risks . According IEA ( 2020b ) carbon content ofproved fossil fuel reserves 3000 GtCO2 , much larger remaining carbonbudgets . world meet Paris targets large fraction current reserves willbe unburnable become stranded ( Carbon Tracker Initiative ( 2011 ) ) . suddenintroduction climate policies ( Monasterolo et al .

( 2022 ) ) lead abrupt revaluation carbon-intensive low-carbon assets . consequentlosses carbon-intensive sector propagate financial networks , under-1.3 Limits mainstream approach . 14mining financial stability affect real economy . Moreover , climate transitionrisks exacerbated events directly related climate policies even theclimate change , COVID-19 pandemics ( Dunz et al . ( 2021a ) ) .Viewing economy complex system important consequences climatechange problem . First , uncertainty confined climate systems , presenteverywhere economy important driver economy evolution . Second , since complex systems rarely state equilibrium , better avoid assumingequilibrium behavior , order neglect factors determine change economyover time ( Arthur et al . ( 2018 ) ; Roos ( 2023 ) ) . discuss next section , thisrequire great change policies analysis future economy projections made , since used models grounded general equilibrium theory . remarked byKirman ( 2016 ) , adopting complex system approach evaluating policy interventionsmeans abandoning attempt restore economy state equilibrium ithad temporarily drifted away.1.3 Limits mainstream approach.Integrated assessment models ( IAM ) , models climate economy arerepresented , main tools used evaluate mitigation adaptation policies . Althoughexisting IAMs differ level detail used represent climate economy , include representation carbon cycle , whose dynamics influenced GHGsemissions coming economic activities ; resulting change climate system isused determine impacts economy . economic module usually based onequilibrium theory.There two fundamental types IAMs : benefit-cost ( BC-IAM ) process-based ( PB-IAM ) ( Weyant , 2017 ) . BC-IAMs ( Hope , 2006 ; Nordhaus , 1993 ; Tol , 1997 ) use anaggregated representation economy main aim determine optimalpolicy , example , carbon tax , maximizes discounted social welfare . havebeen used calculate social cost carbon ( SCC ) USA ( Interagency Working Groupon Social Cost Greenhouse Gases , 2016 ) . PB-IAMs ( Fricko et al. , 2017 ; Kriegler et al.,2017 ) offer detailed representation economic sectors , particular energysector , climate natural systems . Unlike BC-IAMs , used mainly forcost-effectiveness analysis : provide rank ( according cost ) different trajectoriesof outputs sectors achieve given level emissions given temperaturetarget . PB-IAMs used IPCC show trajectories compatible 1.5 2 degrees1.3 Limits mainstream approach . 15 ( IPCC , 2018 ) , central bank financial regulators ( Allen et al. , 2020 ; Vermeulenet al. , 2019 ) large investors climate financial risk analysis ( UNEPFI , 2020 ) . Theywere used also climate stress test exercises Battiston et al . ( 2017 ) used thenetwork greening financial system ( NGFS ) develop scenarios climate stress test ( NGFS , 2020 ) .As remarked Farmer et al . ( 2015 ) , IAMs able deal properly uncertainties , distributional issues , technological change associated climate change . Based therepresentative agent hypothesis , account agents heterogeneity theirinteractions . Information asymmetries , different perceptions , imitation among agents becrucial adoption new green behavior success climate policies . Moreover , policies distributional impacts income wealth undermine theirefficacy result political unrests . Furthermore , climate mitigation targets requirea large-scale transition low-carbon economy . , important account thecharacteristics technological progress . Interactions agents , limited informationand complementarities technologies lead different lock-in states whereone type technology prevails others . Equilibrium theory account forpath-dependency multiple equilibria systems . Moreover , original IAMs assumeexogenous technological progress . extensions , ( Dietz e Stern 2015 ) , includesendogenous progress ; however , account role interactions . Moreover , represent financial sector , crucial account transition risks andevaluate financial climate policie ( Battiston et al . ( 2021 ) ; Dunz et al . ( 2021a ) ; Monasteroloet al . ( 2022b ) ) . BC-IAMs suited account uncertainties climate impacts , inparticular extreme events . since damage functions used models generateaggregated damages account role non uniform distribution impacts.Though drawbacks , agent-based models overcome aboveIAMs limits , since include main elements complex systems . show inthe following , agent-based models instruments used work study climatemitigation pathways.Chapter 2Research purposes adoptedmethodologyMy research focused analysis climate mitigation pathways complex scienceapproach . two main objectives first , test common belief carbon taxpolicy main powerful instrument induce desired climate transition ; second , study policy mix problem , analyzing mix carbon tax policy anda feed-in tariff policy.In following section discuss theoretical foundation carbonpricing policy mix applied climate change problem . Section 2.2 presents anextension multi-criteria analysis method , developed evaluate policy perfor-mances compare different policies ( see Nieddu et al . ( 2023a ) ) .To study climate policies chose complex system approach , particular , Iused macroeconomic agent-based EURACE model described next chapter.The last section chapter describes agent-based modelling approach , well itsapplications climate change problem.2.1 Analyzing mitigation policies climate change2.1.1 Carbon taxCarbon pricing fiscal policy measure sets price GHGs emissions order tomove economies toward low zero carbon regimes . two forms . One put aprice unit emissions tax ; set limit allowable emissions andallow agents trade emission rights . first carbon tax introduced Finland2.1 Analyzing mitigation policies climate change 17in 1990 . Today , 68 national subnational carbon pricing initiative place , covering 23 % global GHGs emissions ( World Bank ( 2022 ) ) .When implementing carbon tax policy one take account several characteris-tics . Since several greenhouse gases contribute global warming ( CO2 , CH4 , N2O etc . ) one characteristic carbon tax set GHGs covers . Anotherimportant aspect set actors pay tax . Since fuel differentdistribution system , one determine point government could impose thetax . choice may serious consequences , yellow vests movement showed.Further , price trajectory determined . Finally , one determine use revenues.Governments may use revenues simply increase budget , use revenues tocounter carbon tax negative distributional impacts , finance climate policies.Carbon tax grounded externality theory . exeternality associated economicaction ( production consumption good ) effect action parties thatdo participate action . assumptions prices carry relevantinformation except relative externality , externalities andthat market mechanism lead efficient allocation resources , eliminate negativeexternality sufficient set price ( increase value ) good associated theexternality equal marginal cost externality . Climate change viewed anexternality production consumption carbon intensive goods . marginal cost iscalled social cost carbon ( SCC ) defined change discounted valueof social welfare caused additional unit GHG emissions ( Nordhaus ( 2017 ) ) . isusually calculated IAMs , although estimates strongly dependent damagesfunction discount rate ( evaluate social welfare ) used object importantdebates literature , ( see example Stern ( 2008 ) ) .According framework establishing carbon tax equal SCC solvethe problems associated climate change , presence market failuresthe argument falls . Real market characterized many externalities anddistorsion , example incomplete imperfect information capital market may give riseto credit rationing ( Stiglitz Weiss ( 1981 ) ) ; effect enhanced green investmentsand projects , characterized higher uncertainties related technological developmentand regulations ( High-Level Commission Carbon Prices ( 2017 ) ) . also climatechange specific market failures related short-terminism climate actions : thepossible catastrophic consequences climate change felt beyond time horizonusually considered economic agents ( Carney ( 2015 ) ) .2.1 Analyzing mitigation policies climate change 18It clear market failures , beyond generated climate externality , affect carbon tax performance . authors , e.g . Tol ( 2017 ) , argue marketfailures reduce efficiency carbon tax still best tool . Eventually , couplingthe carbon tax instruments account market failures lead torecovering efficiency loss . described next subsection , authors argue thatthe effect market failures complex needs investigation.2.1.2 Policy mixAs mentioned introduction , carbon pricing considered efficient option toreduce GHGs emissions ( Nordhaus ( 2007 ) ; Tol ( 2017 ) ; Weitzman ( 2014 ) ) . Using in-struments may lead sub-optimal outcomes . line argument , environmentaleconomics works focused analysis single policies comparison betweentwo instruments.However , emerging body works questioned argument claims thesuperiority policy mix . Görlach ( 2014 ) points optimal policy dependson ’ optimal ’ meant . Carbon pricing may loose best policy status multipleobjectives deviations models present . constitute also motivations forthe adoption multiple instruments ; summarized Bouma et al . ( 2019 ) , justificationsof policy mix literature : existence multiple objectives , presence ofadditional externalities general market failures , well government andbehavioral failures.Beyond GHGs emissions stocks targets , economic efficiency cost-effectiveness targets , climate policies objectives , mitigation dis-tributional consequences policies , political feasibility ( IPCC ( 2014 ) ) . Climatepolicies , carbon pricing , increase cost energy fuels independently theincome level , hit lower income households . Preventing distributionalconsequences relevant ethical considerations feasibility climatepolicy , shown 2018 yellow vests protest French carbon tax.Adopting multiple instruments analysis relevant countries also otherobjectives beyond climate policies ( example SDGs ) may conflict alignwith climate objectives . Furthermore , countries de facto relying instruments mixto enact climate commitments . example , EU emission trading system standsbesides energy efficiency standards vehicles buildings , interact nationalcarbon taxes , incentives national sub-national environmental policies.2.1 Analyzing mitigation policies climate change 19According Tinbergen rule ( Tinbergen ( 1952 ) ) , number instruments beequal number independent goals policy maker wants achieve . , oftheir multiple objectives , climate mitigation interventions rely single instrument.However , even single target , presence externalities may needmore single policy . According main result second best theory , whenmultiple market failures present , targeting one may results outcomeworse do-nothing case ( Lipsey Lancaster ( 1956 ) ) .Externalities , market power imperfect information classical cause marketfailures ( Bator ( 1958 ) ; Randall ( 1983 ) ) , also used justify policy mix tackle theclimate change problem . well known example relevant externality technologicalspillover externality , i.e . benefits technological improvement discovered onegives actors imitate new technology . carbon tax raised tooffset climate externality , disincentive R & due technological spillover mayresult underinvestment development new cleaner technologies , anemission reduction smaller planned . , combination subsidies correcting thetechnological spillover form carbon pricing considered efficient solution byseveral authors ( Goulder Schneider ( 1999 ) ; Jaffe et al . ( 2004 ) ; Sorrell Sijm ( 2003 ) ) .The superiority policy mix claimed also imperfect information considered ( Bennear Stavins ( 2007 ) ; Jaffe et al . ( 2004 ) ; Lehmann ( 2012 ) ) . agents notwell-informed efficient cleaner available technologies , unless relevantinformation provided , unable significantly change behavior , even carbon pricing policy set . Thought uncertainty considered formof imperfect information , cited another justification policy mix ( Bouma et al. ( 2019 ) ) . example , Lecuyer Quirion ( 2013 ) suggest complement emissiontrading system ( ETS ) subsidies renewable energy uncertainties onthe abatement cost function.Similarly concept market failure , behavioral failures referred situations inwhich unregulated economy achieve maximum welfare state agentsbehave differently rational choice theory prescribes ( Shogren Taylor ( 2020 ) ) .Therefore , Shogren Taylor ( 2020 ) argue single instrument limit emissions notnecessarily welfare-enhancing economy behavioral failures . Inspired , amongothers , work Simon ( 1987 ) prospect theory ( Kahneman Tversky ( 1979 ) ; Tversky Kahneman ( 1974 ) ) , behavioral economics ( Thaler ( 2016 , 2018 ) ) farcollected numerous anomalies behavior people , also proposed alternativesolutions problems anomalies relevant . Mullainathan Thaler ( 2000 ) 2.1 Analyzing mitigation policies climate change 20found least three main categories divergences rational behavior occur realeconomies : bounded rationality , bounded willpower bounded self-interest . Agents arebounded rational limited problem solving capabilities thelimited time solve problems face . simplify problems people use rules-of-thumb , led make systematic errors , i.e . choices different average fromthe rational ones Kahneman Tversky ( 1979 ) ; Tversky Kahneman ( 1974 ) . Even thecomputed response rational theory , real agents difficulties enact longterm plans ( bounded willpower ) , self-interest main motivation every agent.Market-based instruments aimed correct environmental externalities fail becauseagents ’ response price signal heterogeneous people thatwill change behavior incompetence , ignorance , intransigence ( Gunningham andSinclair ( 1999 ) ) , behavior based rational choice habit ( Twomeyet al . ( 2012 ) ) . Similarly , agents ’ response information-based policy ( policies aimed totackle market failures due lack information ) heterogeneous influenced ( real ) behavioral factors ( Ferraro Miranda ( 2013 ) ; Weaver ( 2014 ) ) ; therefore , likelythat policy neglects behavioral factors lead desired behavior change.The characteristics real system diverges idealized model haveinfluence policy evaluation . , identified characteristics causesof market behavioral failures . notions based equilibrium assumptions.What real economy evolves out-of-equilibrium ? According Kirman ( 2016 ) , one consider theorems existence anequilibrium state , like Arrow Debreu ( 1954 ) , proofs equilibriumassumptions , uniqueness equilibrium granted even thestringent conditions existence theorems ( Debreu ( 1974 ) ; Mantel ( 1974 ) ; Sonnenschein ( 1972 ) ) , economists able prove , starting out-of-equilibrium state , economy rational agents necessary converge equilibriumstate.Therefore , policy results optimal according equilibrium model , may noteffective implemented real systems out-of-equilibrium dynamics . Forexample , price GHGs established economy reach equilibriumstate , quantity GHGs emitted different ( likely higher ) theequilibrium quantity associated GHGs price . Note argument '' equilibrium failure '' , since concept failure makes sense outside equilibriumtheory . line Kirman ( 2016 ) , argued task climate policy analysis isnot find condition , given multiple failures , free market condition2.2 Developing extended multi-criteria analysis policy evaluation 21 ( perfect competition , perfect information ) restored system reaches thedesired state ; task understand performance policy analysis , ita single instrument policy policy mix , complex economy continually evolveout-of-equilibrium.Though far enlisted arguments favor policy mix , mixes instrumentsperform better components , rule establish synergybetween two instruments , conflicting interactions prevail . Therefore , one thetwo main tasks research policy mix understand interactions instrumentsand characterize set mixes outperforms components ( Bouma et al . ( 2019 ) ) .The second main task define find best mix among outperforming theircomponents.2.2 Developing extended multi-criteria analysis pol-icy evaluationCost-benefit analysis ( CBA ) cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) among mostused quantitative methods compare different climate policies establish isthe best one ( IPCC ( 2014 ) ) . CBA ( Boardman et al . ( 2017 ) ) compares different policiesby evaluating costs benefits , chooses alternative greatestnet benefit . addition problems concerning aggregation individual welfarefunctions , cost-benefit analysis requires benefits costs policy beexpressed monetary value . CEA ( Ekholm ( 2014 ) ) require evaluation thebenefits , choice different alternatives made first excluding donot reach predetermined goal , example certain level emission reduction , bycalculating costs remaining alternatives finally choosing policy thelowest cost . methods rely single metric measure policy performance . However , suggested Greening Bernow ( 2004 ) , single metric represent properly theconsequences climate policies.Multi-criteria analysis ( MCA ) allows use multiple evaluation criteria , without requiringa unique metric measure policy consequences ( Keeney et al . ( 1993 ) ) . first step theanalysis define objectives , attributes needed measure objectives , andthe set possible alternative policies choose . second step , probabilitydistributions consequences determined alternative . Third , preferenceson space consequences must made explicit means utility function . Finally,2.2 Developing extended multi-criteria analysis policy evaluation 22for policy average utility calculated policy highest average utilityis chosen.Before going , necessary clarify used expected utility theory anagent-based model , since principle maximization expected utility one maintargets criticisms equilibrium models , one reasons preferring ABM.The main arguments principle , combined assumptions ascomplete perfect information , unbounded computational power , etc , used describeagent behavior . contrast , aim work rationally evaluate consequencesof different policies , obtained model rely utility maximizationprinciple , evolution system obtained bottom-up fashion . Herethe expected utility theory used normative theory , describe decision bemade , descriptive theory . instance , preferences choices policymakers deny climate change excluded analysis . Moreover , expectedutility theory appropriate method deal uncertainty doesnot require ad hoc adjustments deal extreme cases ( see section 4.1.2 Keeney et al . ( 1993 ) ) , powerful tool deal multi-dimensional consequences itinvolves evaluation scalar quantities.As regards first step MCA , work two objectives chosen evaluatepolicy performance , first maximization emission reduction second isthe minimization economic cost . future convenience , level achievement thefirst objective measured negative emission reduction respect theBAU ε =−E−EBAUEBAU , E EBAU yearly average emissions relative respectivelyto scenario consideration BAU ; second objective measured withthe consumption loss respect BAU c = C−CBAUCBAU , C CBAU yearlyaverage consumption relative respectively scenario consideration BAU.Moreover , set existing alternatives identified 22 simulated scenarios.Therefore , space consequences plane spanned negative emissionreduction consumption loss axes . second step , set differentconsequences policy identified set points space consequencesrelative 50 stochastic realizations scenario.To explicit utility function , rational careful policy maker ( view theauthors ) taken reference : utility monotonic increasing function ofboth arguments ε c ( , first partial derivatives positive ) , policymaker risk averse , , lottery worst best consequence isnever preferred taking lottery average consequence certainty . following the2.2 Developing extended multi-criteria analysis policy evaluation 23definitions theorems relevant construction utility function presentedwithout proofs , detailed discussion , interested reader referred Keeneyet al . ( 1993 ) .Two utility functions u u′ defined strategically equivalent implythe ranking preference set lotteries . u u′ strategically equivalentif related positive linear transformation , i.e . u′ = au+b witha b non-negative numbers . Therefore , following normalization conditions beimposed without loosing generality : u ( εm , cm ) = 0 ( 2.1 ) u ( εM , cM ) = 1 ( 2.2 ) subscripts ε c respectively referred lowest highestvalues.To simplify analysis , common reasonable assumption , mutual utility inde-pendence , made preference structure . attribute ε utility independent ofanother c conditional preferences ε given c depend specific value c.If c utility independent ε , two attributes said mutually utility independent.Mutual utility independence condition satisfied utility u ( ε , c ) bewritten linear formu ( ε , c ) = kεv ( ε ) + kcw ( c ) + kεcv ( ε ) w ( c ) ( 2.3 ) kε kc positive numbers , kεc real number , v ( ε ) w ( c ) monodi-mensional utility functions.Therefore , task finding appropriate function decomposed finding themonodimensional utility functions emissions reductions consumption loss , andthen finding constants kε kc regulates rate preference twoattributes.Both v ( ε ) w ( c ) monotonically increasing argument decreas-ingly risk averse , means policy maker risk averse risk aversiondecrease probability worst consequences reduces . functional form chosenfor v w f ( x ) = ( x−b ) αx , αx ∈ [ 0,1 ] x represents ε c. Imposingnormalization conditions f ( xm ) = 0 f ( xM ) = 1 gives b , that:2.2 Developing extended multi-criteria analysis policy evaluation 24v ( ε ) = ( ε − εmεM − εm ) αε ( 2.4 ) w ( c ) = ( c− cmcM − cm ) αc ( 2.5 ) α ’ regulate degree risk aversion : higher αx lower risk aversion.Once monodimensional utilities fixed , determine global utility three condi-tions needed . First , normalization conditions follows kεc = 1− kε − kc.Note , since u monotonically increasing arguments , kε kc theinterval [ 0,1 ] .To fix kε consider probability π expected utility uπ lottery thatgives best consequence ( εM , cM ) probability π worst ( εm , cm ) 1−π isequal utility lottery gives best emissions reduction worst ( highest ) cost ( εM , cm ) certainty : π ·u ( εM , cM ) + ( 1−π ) ·u ( εm , cm ) = u ( εM , cm ) ( 2.6 ) right hand side equal uπ . Using equations 2.3 , 2.4 2.5 obtain π = kε .Note , since u ( εm , cm ) = 0 , Eq . 2.6 written π =u ( εM , cm ) u ( εM , cM ) . Therefore , sincekε = π , parameter kε regulates importance minimizing emissions relative toboth minimizing emissions cost . Finally , given ε∗ u ( ε∗ , cm ) = u ( εm , cM ) , fromequations 2.3,2.4 2.5 follows kc = kεv ( ε∗ ) . understand role v ( ε∗ ) note thatthe previous condition written v ( ε∗ ) = u ( εm , cM ) kε using expression kεand using u ( εM , cM ) = 1 find v ( ε∗ ) =u ( εm , cM ) u ( εM , cm ) . Therefore , v ( ε∗ ) regulates importanceof minimizing costs respect minimizing emissions . future convenience wedefine ε ′ = ε∗−εmεM−εm . Note ε′ < 1 , reducing emissions better maximizingconsumption ( u ( εM , cm ) > u ( εm , cM ) ) , opposite true ε ′ > 1.kεc determines importance reaching objectives respect pursuing onlyone : greater 0 , reaching objectives important reachingonly one two , lottery gives ( εM , cM ) ( εm , cm ) 50 % probabilityis preferred lottery gives ( εM , cm ) ( εm , cM ) 50 % probability . contraryis true kεc < 0 , finally , kεc = 0 policy maker indifferent twolotteries.To obtain utility function sufficient specify values parameters αε , αc , π ε ′ . However reasonable given choice parameters may appear , arbitrary andone may ask happens policy ranking different set values chosen .

Therefore , ABMs need assumptions typicalof equilibrium models overcome IAMs drawbacks cited above.While traditional approaches focus variables aim write system ofequations motion , ABM focus abstraction activity shifted theentities comprise systems , characteristics , interactions amongthem environment give rise global behavior.2.3 Agent-based modelling climate change economics 26In ABMs , macroeconomics variables obtained summing corresponding micro-scopic variables ( e.g . aggregate household income given sum incomeof households present model ) relations macroeconomic variablesare imposed top-down constructed observations .

ABM contributions literature differ policy ( set policies ) considered ; carbon tax one studied , fiscal policies asincentives low-carbon energy efficiency improving investments financialinterventions investigated . However , majority ABM studies climate change dealswith single instrument analysis comparison isolated instruments , fewworks ( example Lamperti et al . ( 2021 ) ) investigate mix 2 policies .
