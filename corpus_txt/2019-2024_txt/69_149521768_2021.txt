Introduction Recent researches increasingly focused realization carbon neutrality , reduce carbon emission zero . Environmental Kuznets Curve ( EKC ) proposed Dinda ( 2004 ) showed us environmental cost development inverted U-shape function development stage , meaning goes gradually falling , called technological effect , economy becomes affluent , called technological effect . discussion concerns , thus , global environment preservation , also country-wise economic development , discussion income equality . Income carbon expected positively related . Several papers succeeded linking emission growth gross domestic product ( GDP ) ( Al-Mulali et al. , 2013 ; Huang et al. , 2008 ; Ozturk Al-Mulali , 2015a ) , Zhang & Cheng ( 2009 ) gave strong causality result energy consumption carbon emission determine growth . Meanwhile , results sensitive sample selection statistical techniques ( Huang et al. , 2008 ; Payne , 2010 ) . EKC relatively strong empirical support ( Ajmi et al. , 2013 ; Aung et al. , 2017 ; Balıbey , 2015 ; Gozgor , 2017 ; Choi et al. , 2011 ; Oshin , 2014 ; Özokcu Özdemir , 2017 ; Zhang , 2018 ) , question whether growth GDP alone explain trade-off development environment , let alone carbon . Literatures field covered widely connection carbon emission measures economic development quality , including income inequalities , various choice proxy variable selection , scale data , model settings . Two variables particular research value , economic complexity index ( ECI ) Gini index . ECI measured diversification categories economy ’ export list ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ) . concerns flexibility production economy , ability survive macroeconomic shocks . thus representative development quality diversification potential economy , plausible proxy test EKC concerning carbon problem . strong predictive power income inequality ( Hartmann et al. , 2017a ; Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ) . Considering link income consumption , value included triplet dynamic carbon income inequality . Linking income inequality carbon emission new problem ( Teng et al. , 2011 ) Literatures argued income inequality linked carbon emission distribution policy potentially dynamic way ( Cantore Padilla , 2010 ; Duro Padilla , 2006 ; Heil Wodon , 2000 , 1997 ; Padilla Serrano , 2006 ) . problem neither theoretical discussions empirical works reached common ground ( Liu et al. , 2020 ) , directional impact . findings showed higher income inequality leads higher emission . crucial chain logic standing behind statement poor , unequal society , consume aggressively emulate rich , signaling social status albeit necessarily optimal welfare . phenomenon called Veblen effect ( Bagwell Bernheim , 1996 ; Dahm Fassnacht , 2018 ; Veblen , 2018 , 2005 ) thereby lead inefficient energy consumption luxurious carbon emissions . contrast , many regional studies argued income equality leads carbon inequality , renders distribution carbon emission left-skewed income axis ( Hübler , 2017 ) . research gap exists little work done establish multi-variable dynamic involving carbon development metrics , mention work global scale . regional studies static comparison limited number entities help uncover empirically dynamics , generalized global perspective ( Abdon Felipe , 2012 ; Al-Mulali et al. , 2013 ; Alvaredo Gasparini , 2015 ; Basu Stiglitz , 2016 ; Choi et al. , 2011 ; Fang Wolski , 2019 ; Ferraz et al. , 2018 ; Hartmann et al. , 2017b ; Oshin , 2014 ; Palma , 2011 ; Wolde-Rufael Idowu , 2017 ; Zhang , 2018 ) . study broader scale using concise model study triplet dynamics gives paper place filling niche field . paper tries bridge gap explaining , triplet dynamics carbon emission , economic complexity , inequality indicators , potential Pareto improvement boosts economy reining environmental damage . Specifically , research used data 5 decades 116 countries , EKC Veblen effect could verified , Pareto optimization improving economic development environmental preservation specific economy would arise . Additionally , paper uses triplet show development trajectory economies balancing carbon outlets economic development . paper intents provide policy suggestions potential carbon neutrality strategy cohesion economic development . Model Results propose hypothesis follows : H1 : ECI quadratically influence carbon emission , coefficient quadratic term negative represent EKC , i.e. , technological effect exists . H2 : adjusted Gini index positive impact carbon outlet , i.e. , Veblen Effect exists . choice model panel model accommodate data , uses ECI , quadratic term ECI , adjusted Gini index main regressors . adjusted Gini index composed Gini index data similar inequality measurement complement missing data described appendix . Control variables include GDP growth , GDP per capita , region dummies income group dummies . dummies given world bank database . analyze development pattern countries , apply k-means clustering analysis ten yearly-phased data . , aim identify whether certain countries similar traits triplet decade , therefore showing similarities trade-off decisions terms economic development environmental preservation . economies jump different clusters , economy succeeded altering triplet characteristics , jump lasting transitory . apply series panel models use carbon emission per capita dependent variable . results visible Table 1 . results suggest strong significance variables interests main model , i.e. , model ( 3 ) ( 4 ) . verify robustness model result , auxiliary regressions , i.e. , model ( 2 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , created series tests ( Table 3 ) performed help solidify robustness fixed effect model result summarized . starters , tests suggest fix effect models outperform plain OLS model pooling model . random effect model better pooling model according Breusch-Pagan test . Hausman test support random effect model fix effect model . tests concur fix effect model better choice data . Although Breusch-Pagan test time effects showed time-fixed effect recommended , unbalance nature data stops us acknowledging reliability test result . hereafter focus fix effect model framework , i.e. , model ( 3 ) . Table 3 . Test results Test P value F test individual effects 2.27E-298 Hausman Test 3.67E-09 Lagrange Multiplier Test - ( Breusch-Pagan ) unbalanced panels 0.793 Lagrange Multiplier Test - time effects ( Breusch-Pagan ) unbalanced panels 0.00E+00 Hypothesis 1 2 evaluated verified main model , ( 4 ) . Specifically , ECI negatively , quadratically affects carbon emission per capita , i.e. , technological effect exists ; meanwhile , Veblen effect significant . large , results agrees significantly technological effect development reduces environmental harm , agrees significantly Veblen effect ( Veblen , 2005 ) , controlling ECI development metrics like growth GDP per capita . Coefficient estimates ECI quadratic significantly negative , suggesting controlling variables , countries ECI -2.5 entering technological effect theorized Dinda ( 2004 ) , economic complexity help drastically reduce carbon emission per consumer done directly reducing income inequality . ECI Gini separate effect carbon emission , justifying triplet dynamics . main model shows EKC Veblen effect present , almost models various settings agree estimation result , varying scale effect . model disagrees strong causality found Zhang & Cheng ( 2009 ) GDP growth energy consumption , possibly decomposing effect technological effect Veblen effect . model prone theory diversification production exports , combined equal income distribution , significant impact carbon footprints . controlling variables , coefficients significant directions expected . GDP per capita significant effect carbon emission . safe conjecture higher individual income leads inevitably increase carbon emission . regions income groups , every model agrees strong significance general statements . Ruling forces , regions emit less North America region , income groups emit low-income group . several comparably fossil-fuel-concentrated economies , Middle East North Africa region comes second place consumes 5 tons less per person year . model recognizes little difference low-income group effect lower-middle-income group effect suggests consumer upper-income higher-income countries consumes average 3 8 tons per person yearly basis . verify robustness inequality indicator construction , checked model Gini index calculated arithmetic mean Gini index surveys UTIP data time point certain nation . results still valid direction significance . Please see Table 3 . verify robustness model , cluster-robust standard error ( CRSE ) introduced model ( 5 ) cope heterogeneity improve estimate efficiency . CRSE approach efficient given sufficient number clusters exist cluster contains enough number samples ( Cameron Miller , 2015 ) , satisfied sample size . CRSE approach strongly agrees findings model ( 3 ) . add reliability model ( 3 ) , random effect model ( 4 ) least-squares dummy variable ( LSDV ) model ( 2 ) agrees model ( 3 ) signs coefficients . Lastly , applied k-means clustering analysis ten yearly-phased , summarized panel data find whether clustering similar countries terms triplet changes five decades . Firstly , summarized normalized mean carbon outlet per capita , ECI , Gini index five decades 1964 2017 . K-means clustering analysis performed data divided five periods . estimation parameter k obtained classic elbow approach Silhouette approach multi-perspective analysis . create data visualizations five periods colored countries consistently according regions better understanding results . addition , clusters circled convex polygons ten-year sample graph . results visible graphically Figure 1-5 , relevant findings presented discussions . discussed later , clustering analysis summarized several development trajectories terms triplet . Discussion Carbon reduction combination economic growth promoted equality part five decades question , developed world hovers often high ECI , low Gini zone , whereas developing world spend five decades , trying escape , low ECI , high Gini zone . matters perhaps negative correlation ECI Gini ( Hartmann et al. , 2017a ) , potential countries optimize development improving ECI development resilience income inequality evade Veblen effect . measures benefit economic development , whereas reduces carbon emission , thereby forming Pareto Optimization everyone earns . project median ECI Gini 2003 2017 country Gini-ECI plane , size representing median emission per capita Figure 6 . Figure 6 . Emission Per Capita Gini-ECI plane , 2003-2017 average Figure 6 , combined panel models , shows countries high ECI , low Gini zone relatively lower emission , locally , since project income per capita graph . exceptions , e.g. , developing countries low ECI , high Gini , lower emission compared close bad ECI Gini . carbon emissions exceptions often dominated low average income level . general , link emission-ECI-Gini triplet points optimal solution economic development income inequality focusing first economic complexity . data shows , many economies entering technological effect , development helps reduce carbon outlets , matching EKC hypothesis . may seem awkward since technological effect predicted occur highly developed economy . occurrence technological effect result technological spillover , rising economies enjoys positive externality technological product developed world . Simply diversifying production activities makes economy resilient towards unexpected shocks allows various means energy consumption , reducing reliance fossil fuels , therefore carbon . Inequality another factor optimize . Though regional researches suggested left-skewed income distribution reduces source energy consumption ( Baloch et al. , 2018 ; Coondoo Dinda , 2008 ; Heerink et al. , 2001 ; Nikodinoska Schröder , 2016 ; Ravallion et al. , 2000 ) , global picture suggests comparably unequal economy always find way emit carbon less efficiently . underlying results negligence improving energy consumption efficiencies people due inequal social status induced income gap . People way less attention focus environment protection struggling earn living change lives . Veblen effect ( Veblen , 2005 ) stands realistic explanation inequality-carbon dynamics . results model ECI Gini also help clarify myth development environment protection . fear rapid development achieved cost carbon emission , correct according significantly positive contribution pure economic growth carbon outlet models . model results show conclusion , nevertheless , potentially result omitting effect measure income inequality complex mechanism utilizing economic complexity control carbon emission . Comparison omitted-variable models main model nurture confidence policy makers . long ECI income inequality check , growth , however large , lead worsen environment . Though emission per capita go eventually average income amounts , ceteris paribus , Pareto optimization discussed far still provides chances greatly slow pollution along way economic development . next pertinent question whether specific road maps follow optimization . Development Trajectories carbon dilemma late-starters put finding perspectives , studied development track countries economies past five decades Gini-ECI plane , attempting see economies balance triplet emission , ECI , Gini , i.e. , development environment . employed cluster analysis identify situation countries simultaneously maintain certain degree economic growth decreasing carbon emissions . k-means cluster analysis provides angle conjectures . Equilibrium higher ECI , lower Gini , lower carbon emission general goal every economy , model suggested . reality , Europe Central Asia regions full economies characterized five decades . usually separated developing world , including mostly Sub-Saharan African , Middle East North African , Latin American Caribbean , South Asian countries . developing countries observed little movements high ECI , low Gini areas . improve factors , emission level drops accordingly . Although say Europe Central Asia reached efficient equilibrium , still constitute encouraging goals developing world terms triplet . story East Asia Pacific area yet uncanny one . clusters countries shifted several times along decades . first decade 1964 1975 , East Asian countries regarded equals developing world , exceptions , Japan China . time maintain unremarkable ECI Gini level . next decade witnessed economies rises , improved ECI sequentially lessened Gini . Among , Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , New Zealand clustered either European area , upper-middle income thriving peers like Spain , Ireland , Israel , Argentina , South Africa . following decade , par European area Central Asia , surpassing Canada , Russia Australia , leaving developing world behind . 1996 2005 , trend persists Japan become exception , talk shortly afterwards . period world roughly divided Europe-US-East-Asia centered cluster rest-of-the world cluster . see area golden example development path . economies category usually started plain , found way higher level ECI , maneuvered way undesirable inequality cash Veblen effect right even alongside ECI boost . process started improvement ECI increased level carbon emission due sudden income surge . ECI boost usually accompanied technological effect reduces carbon emission . effect explains coexistence development stable average carbon outlet East Asian economies . clusters display Veblen effect macro scale , growth ECI slows . regional increment per capita emission East Asia Pacific area , accompanied stable ECI increment Gini , viewed long-term attempt meet existing consumption standards , life standards sense , two comparably developed areas , North America , Europe Central Asia . absolute level average emission suggests North America , Europe Central Asia maintaining relatively high amount per capita carbon outlet given relatively small population . Albeit effort reduce carbon emission stably high ECI relatively low Gini index , higher emission signals luxurious mode consumption standard . emulation developing countries towards developed economies exists , since ECI East Asia Pacific economies stabilizes recent decade , carbon footprint still increases Gini . carbon footprint gradually lowers settled near high ECI , low Gini zone . exceptions like China Japan paving way towards USA , harms environmental health inevitably . United States , rather viewed peer Europe cluster , constantly isolated one cluster . biggest distinction high ECI , developed European peers observed deterioration income inequality , fluctuations . moves along path , carbon footprint follow reasonable trend increases . phenomenon sign existence Veblen effect , inequality motivates emulation inefficient consumptions . cautions reader China Japan , similar problems , elevated stabilizing ECI , elevated Gini , elevated carbon outlets . previous paragraphs mentioned , worst end trend Veblen effect taking place truly global scale , income inequality induced , inefficient consumption drives high carbon emission like tomorrow . attempts greater developing world desired . Ideally , developing world aims follow example East Asia Pacific area , reality constantly disturbs realizing first crucial step , elevation ECI level . close success 1976 1985 , instances , Israel , Argentina , India , South Africa , Mexico , Jordan . progress short-lived . end decade , Israel made high ECI , low Gini zone , whereas rest frontrunners Sub-Saharan Africa , Middle East North Africa , Latin America Caribbean , South Asia re-clustered together . symbolizes start two-decade-long struggle break free group countries . stays emitting level carbon , worsens due intense income inequality bad ECI . decade 2006 2017 new era world . developed European economies settled high ECI , low Gini zone , together Japan , Korea , Israel . Mid-tier developed European Central Asia economies mixed Asia-Pacific economies rising developing economies Latin America Caribbean area . developing world achieved lower emission coping inequality , vast majority still low ECI , high Gini zone , increased emission compared decade ago . suggests reducing inequality first noble attempt , difficult path ECI improvement development overall . add perspective , Silhouette estimation approach constantly separate countries two clusters periods . Still , pointed Kuwait , Qatar , United Arab Emirates three nations frequently deviating rest world . finding suggest three nations marked exceedingly disproportional carbon emission regard economic complexity income inequality . Given circumstances feature space , deserve analyzed separately development strategies policy suggestions , beyond scope paper . Policy Recommendation opposed usual perception trade-offs development policies environmentally friendly policies , work far suggested increasing ECI lowering Gini help reduce carbon emission via technological effect Veblen effect . development trajectory agrees suggested optimal development path , transition often accompanied lowered emission average , sudden soaring income . path great value , since provides example countries fighting get rid poverty , inequality , possibly desiring lower environment externality . hurdle practice lies lifting ECI occasions , deserves maximum focus . Directly , economic complexity enables economy adopt diversified range production , enabling utilization energy source . Earlier literatures , different angles , argued merely boosting GDP growth developing world solution situation welfare ( Alvaredo Gasparini , 2015 ; Morelli et al. , 2015 ; Palma , 2011 ) , mention carbon emission . discovered cluster models , Kuwait , Qatar , United Arab Emirates frequently isolated low ECI world five decades , mostly skyrocketing emission level per capita . countries similar economies known skewed focus fossil-fuel-related industries , reason high-rising carbon outlet . wider range production export choices production procedure energy source , also endogenous capability within economy thrive different shocks , e.g. , Covid-19 crisis . Economic complexity transfer different production practices , also human capital even aggregate demands meet trigger industrialization ( Pugliese et al. , 2017 ; Carvalho & Rezai , 2016 ; Ferraz et al. , 2018 ) . capability ensures complex source income , sophisticated economic structure industrialization , well nurturing human capital distinctive industries ( Lee Vu , 2019 ) . words , stably high level economic complexity gifts economy flexibility expand good days stronger recovery ability stand short-term shocks . flexibility economic structure enables market participants engage different productions , thereby creating various opportunities reduce poverty income inequality . Improving economic complexity first step actually bring welfare country , achieved environmentally friendly . comes following reduction income inequality . Many Asia-Pacific economies maintained stable level carbon enjoying benefit economic growth , due technological effect reduces carbon emission . number , however , faced income inequality problems . problem , also existing problem USA well . Veblen effect , models suggest , due problem every economy reach high ECI , low carbon equilibrium , developing world prepared challenge . seems working Europe Central Asia welfare system open government pursuit . system rids citizens critical survival concerns , together chances climb higher social ladder , suggested effective eliminating need emulation status-related consumption . provide example bigger developing world , Ozturk & Al-Mulali ( 2015a ) showed city-level model municipal governance key carbon control . capability local governance ruling corruption better management city planning driving force carbon reduction developing economy . policy makers consider urbanization , moderate level beneficial emission control ( Shah et al. , 2020 ) , due ability empower local economic complexity . Figure 7 . Development track Israel nation-level example tell us specific story . Among economies , Israel realized threshold economy drive via elevating ECI along development . development , inequality goes gradually , hedging decreasing effect ECI emission per capita . economy settles good condition 21st century , started lowering inequality maintaining high level ECI . achievement falling emission peak recent years . example good reference learn countries try rid people rights economic development maintaining range environmentally friendly industrial policies . Appendix Methodology Data Data data use fusion information multiple sources . carbon emission data comes World Bank , well GDP , income group region categorization . panel includes annual data points 125 countries , 1964 2017 . data points well balanced , especially Gini index . Thus , model Gini index regressor usually 4,034 samples entire panel . auxiliary regressions paper leaved Gini index , therefore contains 5316 samples work . described , discrepancies change carbon emission GDP total per capita level suggested extra factors dynamics . propose hypothesis model , briefly describe motivation , data collection present descriptive analysis . Per capita GDP seems able explain carbon outlet , Figure A1 shows brute correlation GDP per capita average emission worldwide past five decades . intriguing part data , link linear , especially look data different economies . correlation deceiving , nevertheless . Figure A2 , increment per capita emission North America , Europe Central Asia almost unrecognizable , even dropping recent years . East Asia Pacific , Middle East North Africa areas realized massive increase average carbon outlet decades . trend hold strongly per capita income according Figure 3 . observed increment average GDP leading carbon emitter nations surprise , fact per capita emission changed non-proportionally income beyond explanation . Even use descriptive statistics total-amount fashion , numbers still fail add ( Figure A4-A5 ) . series discrepancies points unconsidered factors . suspect macroeconomic perspectives help explain dynamics . economic complexity proxied presumption good representation economic complexity economy embodiment diversity production , therefore export . natural choice Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) Hidalgo & Hausmann ( 2009 ) . higher ECI implies higher diversification categories economy ’ export list . diversified export list brings diversity income economy ’ individual consumers . ECI level ranges -2.25 2.5 entire panel sample . negative note simply means extreme lack diversity economy ’ export repertoire . view period time horizon social experiment , ECI level serves semblance initial condition endowment country . average high-income country , mean ECI 0.92 past two decades , 0.89 thirty-four years . numbers middle-income countries low-income countries found Table 1 zero . recent two decades , situation improved upper middle-income countries high-income countries , worsen relatively less wealthy nations . look trend increasing gap perspective regions , see Figure A6 East Asia Pacific North America two regions improved ECI recent two decades . gap export diversity another factor renders economy different , apart plain GDP numbers income inequality . Figure A7 gives information terms across time distribution ECI region , regional advantage remains obvious . Table A1 . Ten yearly-phased-mean ECI income groups Income group 1964-1998 1998-2017 Low income -0.8554420 -1.0175783 Lower middle income -0.6322589 -0.7494670 Upper middle income -0.2297148 -0.1331103 High income 0.8922191 0.9215886 introduce income inequality discussion , resort Gini index . income Gini index contains crucial information income distribution among market participants economy . argued Cobham & Sumner ( 2013 ) , Palma measure income inequality , taking account top 10 percent bottom 40 percent households , reflect explicitly status inequality . data accessibility constraints , however , remains undermine usability Palma measure , since missing required data calculation usually reason Gini index data unbalanced . Since two measures work virtually , Gini index sufficient analysis . data source Gini index mixed , good reasons . World Bank database possessed information income distribution globally , indeed gave us good reference several years . Throughout observation period , however , source alone leaves us highly unbalanced panel work . complement data integrity , resort two extra sources , University Texas Inequality Project ( 2015 ) ( UTIP ) World Income Inequality Database ( UNU-WIDER , 2020 ) ( WIID ) . UTIP provides estimated data inequality data based Theil 's statistic . principle , estimation inequality indicator takes account population , industry pay , income gap ( University Texas Inequality Project , 2015 ) . Apart filling missing values countries within panel , also provides information beyond scope Gini index constructed estimating discrepancies income allocation demographic distribution ( Conceicao Ferreira , 2005 ) . scaling , data compatible joined used Gini index . UTIP data made losses around 600 data points , aside adding reliability existing data . WIID offers , though unbalanced , multiple sources analysis income inequality . gathers data World Bank survey , also surveys performed demographical department local government , among surveys . entry , exceptions , usually comes survey quality score . importance score negligible since distribution , kernel estimation , show normality displays left-skewness income group data . attend reliability surveys , summarize weighted average Gini index based survey quality whenever possible , averaging UTIP data available . main conclusions study based weighted average Gini index cope data contamination . add robustness consider difference Gini index Theil ’ index , checked result using solely data WIID . course robustness check , Gini index calculated arithmetic mean entry time point certain nation . model result , verification , much different coefficient direction significance . collateral benefit method helped reduce unbalanced nature data improved goodness fit . hereafter refer inequality index computed using merge information Gini index UTIP data adjusted Gini index simplicity . Hartmann , Guevara , et al . ( 2017 ) proposed global scale , ECI negative correlation Gini index . data Gini index verifies proposition sense . Inequality situation different regions differs mean level ECI , normally distributed across time . Decomposing data income groups throughout decades , see , though slight , decrease inequality happened across income groups , except high-income group ( Figure A8-A9 ) . Model Choices empirical study three factors revolve largely around panel model , ARDL , VECM , GMM estimation subordinates ( et al. , 2020 ; Huang et al. , 2008 ; Hübler , 2017 ; Kijima et al. , 2010 ) . Even concise panel model , question remains whether fixed effect model random effect model developed , merits unifiable proper framework ( Mundlak , 2016 ) . yet applicable approach may choose based widely used Hausman test ( Hausman , 1978 ) , also choose according characteristics data , amplitude correlation size panel ( Clark Linzer , 2015 ) .
