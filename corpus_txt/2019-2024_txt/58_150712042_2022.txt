Abstract La complessità economica è una teoria e una metrica economica creata da Cesar Hidalgo e Ricardo Hausmann nel 2009 che coglie , attraverso gli output di un'economia , le capacità essa contenute e determina il suo livello di complessità rispetto ad altri Paesi . È dimostrato che la complessità economica di un Paese è positivamente correlata alle sue possibilità di crescita economica . La complessità economica guida le politiche industriali e di sviluppo di alcuni Paesi e regioni . Tuttavia , affinché la complessità economica possa essere considerata una strategia di sviluppo sostenibile con il benessere umano come obiettivo finale , è necessario indagare la sua relazione con altre aree . Questa monografia studia la relazione tra complessità economica e diritti umani , ponendosi le seguenti domande di ricerca : La complessità economica è correlata positivamente ai diritti umani ? Se sì , quali sono le possibilità e gli ostacoli alla complessificazione dei Paesi ? Per rispondere alle domande di ricerca , è stato utilizzato un approccio multi metodo che include uno studio di caso sullo sviluppo della Corea del Sud e uno studio quantitativo che utilizza l'analisi di regressione di dati pannello transnazionali sull'Indice di Complessità Economica ( ECI ) e sull'Indice di Progresso Sociale ( SPI ) per più di 120 Paesi nel periodo 2010-2019 . Inoltre , è stata effettuata un'analisi qualitativa delle sfide e delle opportunità che Paesi via di sviluppo possono avere nell'implementare una strategia di sviluppo basata sulla complessità economica , considerando il commercio internazionale , il dominio tecnologico e il potere delle aziende , oltre questioni macro come il cambiamento climatico , la disuguaglianza di reddito e ricchezza , le dinamiche demografiche e il multilateralismo . Lo studio di caso ha mostrato un'apparente relazione tra la strategia di sviluppo economico adottata dalla Corea del Sud e il miglioramento della situazione dei diritti umani , soprattutto materia di educazione e salute . La regressione ha confermato l'esistenza di una forte correlazione positiva tra complessità economica e diritti umani . Un aumento unitario dell'ECI corrisponde un aumento di 4,6 dell'SPI . Infine , l'analisi qualitativa ha mostrato che le sfide oggi superano le opportunità per numero , probabilità e impatto .

Economic complexity looks combinations human capabilities drivers innovation . metrics indicate desirability making new products activities entering new sectors industries according level complexity , combined principle relatedness , provides tools analyse likeliness success investing different areas . evidence economic complexity country positively related economic growth possibilities . Indeed , countries regions use economic complexity theory metrics guide industrial policies . examples Europe ’ Smart Specialization Strategy , Canada ’ Superclusters Initiative China ’ special economic zones . Since used strategy applied countries ’ productive structures achieve economic growth , would interesting understand relationship human development , specifically , realisation human rights freedoms . Thus , monography ’ first research question : economic complexity positively correlated human rights realisation ? answer question , regression analysis relationship Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) Social Progress Index ( SPI ) done , covering period 2010 2019 . Moreover , relationship economic complexity human rights exemplified case study South Korean economic social development , described many scholars policymakers miracle . Given expected influence international economic political system relations development efforts countries , second question posed : possibilities obstacles countries ’ complexification nowadays ? answer question , qualitative analysis done main challenges opportunities countries ’ development . analysis includes entails implementing economic complexity-based industrial policy review key external issues influence . thesis structured follows . Chapter dedicated literature review economic complexity theory goes basic concepts drivers relationship economic complexity economic growth , income inequality , environment , social 6 matters gender equality health outcomes , human development . Chapter II defines framework thesis discussing difference human development human rights presenting research questions . chapter also dedicated case study South Korean economic development , understand relationship economic complexity human rights within particular unprecedented example development contemporary history . Chapter III , first research question answered quantitative study relationship economic complexity human rights realisation . contains introductory discussion human rights data associated challenges , detailed description data econometric model used obtained results . Finally , Chapter IV dedicated answering second research question . presents entails adopting economic complexity strategy challenges opportunities related international community rules dynamics . Specifically , international trade , technology corporate power addressed , well broader questions climate change , inequality , poverty demographic shifts . 7 Chapter – Economic complexity economic theory development strategy 1 . Economic complexity index idea economic complexity first introduced scientific community Chilean physicist Cesar Hidalgo Venezuelan economist Ricardo Hausmann 2009 . created improved empirically-based version theories previous economists , Adam Smith idea economic growth related division knowledge labour ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) , endogenous growth theorists , similarly , understood economic growth growth knowledge ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2009 ) . economic complexity theory also made possible application complex methods machine learning study economic geography ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) . theory economic complexity rather intuitive . Basically , idea countries ’ productive structures based collective knowledge country diversified knowledge combines multiple ways different structures organisations produce technology-intensive diverse goods , complex wealthier country . Furthermore , possible distinguish less complex countries looking diversity non-ubiquity outcomes productive structures . Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) , example , decided look export basket countries possible compare diversity products countries make ubiquity products looking many countries produce products ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2009 ) . idea better explained Lego pieces analogy presented theory creators : “ create indirect measures capabilities available country thinking capability building block Lego piece . analogy , product equivalent Lego model , country equivalent bucket Legos . Countries able make products necessary capabilities , like child able produce Lego model child ’ bucket contains necessary Lego pieces . Using analogy question economic complexity equivalent asking whether infer properties diversity exclusivity Lego pieces inside child ’ bucket looking models group children , different bucket Legos , make . show possible interpret data connecting countries products export bipartite network assume network result larger , tripartite network , connecting countries capabilities products capabilities require ( … ) . Hence , connections countries products signal availability capabilities country like creation model child 8 signals availability specific set Lego pieces ” ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2009 , p. 10.570 ) . decision use trade data comes fact detailed extensive dataset captures productive activities standardized way1 . However , limitations using trade data proxy countries ’ productive capacity . first problem data thus far include services , sector increasing importance trade balance countries , second products produced exported country , vice-versa . solve part problems , Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2014 ) considered products countries revealed comparative advantage ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2014 ) . data sources patents metropolitan area technology total payroll industry city also used measure complexity smaller scale similar results ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) . calculate economic complexity countries , authors use method reflections . Economic complexity turns useful tool gives measure countries ’ complexity possibilities growth – Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) . ECI much accurate tool predict growth metrics human capital , competitiveness quality institutions governance , explaining 73 % variation income across countries2 . shows countries ’ income levels generally change according level productive knowledge . Therefore , gap income level country level complexity reflects country ’ economic growth potential34 . synthesis , economic complexity understood driver economic growth ECI measure ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2014 ) . According ECI , 2020 , first five complex countries Japan , Switzerland , Taiwan , South Korea Germany , less complex countries Papua New Guinea , Nigeria , Burkina Faso Angola ( OEC , n.d.-a ) . Observatory 1 country-product associations use international trade data disaggregated according three alternative data sources classifications : ( 1 ) Standard International Trade Classification ( SITC ) revision 4 4-digit level ; ( 2 ) COMTRADE Harmonized System 4-digit level ; ( 3 ) North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS ) 6-digit level ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2009 ) . 2 result controls countries significant presence natural resources high income without complex ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2014 ) . 3 ECI export-oriented growth , export diversification , country size trade openness ( Hidalgo , 2021 ; Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2014 ) . 4 Recently popularisation economic complexity theory methodology , scholars published articles suggesting slight modifications ( Schetter , 2019 ) alternatives model created Hidalgo Hausmann ( Albeaik et al. , 2017 ; Cristelli et al. , 2013 , 2015 ; Lapatinas et al. , 2019 ; Lo Turco & Maggioni , 2020 ; Sciarra et al. , 2020 ) could even precise capturing complexity countries ’ productive structures also predicting future economic growth . 9 Economic Complexity ( OEC ) 5 also Product Complexity Index ( PCI ) shows , year 2020 , three complex products metal working transfer machines , developed exposed photographic material photo lab equipment . less complex product ranked cocoa beans , followed chromium ore tin ores6 ( OEC , n.d.-b ) possible see products like machines , chemicals electronics top PCI , agricultural products related extractive activities bottom , reflecting intensity knowledge needed perform activities give cited outputs . Figure 1 shows ECI countries ranked OEC 2020 : ECI , thus , measure looks outputs countries ’ productive structures infer capacities available countries . look inputs make country less knowledge-intensive agnostic nature knowledge combined transformed less diverse complex outputs . applying dimensionality reduction techniques , learns directly data without assuming nature factors ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) . Yet , dialogues principle relatedness , ECI gives useful direction countries diversify specialize , lead economic growth development . 5 OEC website contains data research pieces economic complexity - www.oec.world . 6 Considering countries products available data 2020 . Figure 1 : Economic complexity index countries 2020 . Retrieved OEC , n.d.-a . 10 2 . principle relatedness principle relatedness comes idea productive tacit knowledge , technology skills concentrated space activities , industries products less related require less similar inputs or/and knowledge . study relatedness also recently formalized empirical evidence . Relatedness metrics reveal path dependencies predict location ’ probability entering exiting economic activity looking related activities location already ( Hidalgo et al. , 2018 ) . first scholars measure relatedness products trade data Hidalgo et al . 2007 . introduced idea product space , shows probability country start exporting product depending number related products already exports ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) . Similarly , determine relatedness industries , research areas , technologies occupations , scholars look flow labour among industries , shared labour pools , ( Hidalgo et al. , 2018 ) . work Neffke & Henning ( 2013 ) , example , indicated firms ’ diversification choices strongly associated skills choices available human resources . , possibility firm diversify dependent skill-relatedness . arrive conclusion , authors used data cross-industry labour flows 400 different industries Sweden 2004 2007 ( Neffke & Henning , 2013 ) . like ECI , inputs imperfectly observed , relatedness allows us see correlation activities without precisely knowing nature relationship . Nevertheless , principle relatedness strong , ubiquitous robust countries tend deviate 7 % cases ( Hidalgo et al. , 2018 ) . showcased review Hidalgo ( 2021 ) , product space contains well-defined clusters ( connected products peripherical areas ( less connected products ) , latter composed less complex products ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) : 11 Relatedness useful countries identifies fair precision easy difficult start certain new activity comparison activities , thus showing promising pathways industrial diversification , also Figure 2 : product space categories products assigned colours . Retrieved Hidalgo ( 2021 ) . 12 shows need create mechanisms knowledge flow among industries territories different policies promoting mobility people creating industrial parks . Moreover , relatedness studies go intuitive thought countries target related activities easier perform state optimal approach target relatively unrelated activities opportunity window ( Hidalgo et al. , 2018 ) . Another “ common sense ” debunked study relatedness countries need diversify stepping forward productive value chains , showing actually easier invest upstream links value chains7 knowledge . example , would efficient country produces grains invest producing agricultural machines biochemical inputs crops processing grains ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) . Even helpful information provided study relatedness , easy countries diversify increase complexity productive structures current level complexity already limits possibilities . Hidalgo & Hausmann ( 2014 ) put , countries face “ chicken egg problem ” . New activities require new capabilities present country capabilities present demand . adds fact complex knowledge , concentrates space difficult diffused ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2014 ) . short , knowledge activities ’ complexity level possibilities growth captured ECI , together information relatedness activities provided principle relatedness , usefully inform industrial policies countries , precise ever guidance specialisation diversification could ultimately lead economic growth development . 3 . drivers economic complexity mentioned , economic complexity metrics look nature complexity . Hidalgo & Hausmann ( 2014 ) said “ ( … ) development expression total amount productive knowledge embedded society . process knowledge accumulated structure starting understand ” ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2014 , p. 48 ) . However , popularisation economic 7 upstream links value chain refer operations part manufacturing process , necessary basic materials producing finished products obtained ( Downstream Operations , 2020 ) . 13 complexity theory within economic research field , scholars started trying identify drivers8 economic complexity even detailed explanation economic complexity comes reality . words Lo Turco & Maggioni ( 2020 ) : “ Economic complexity , indeed , may reflect quality local formal informal institutions , variety inputs , advances technology , well higher human capital requirement . Uncovering elements behind notion complexity allows shed light channels underlying nexus complexity growth , would favour development precise insights guide policy makers effectively ” ( Lo Turco & Maggioni , 2020 , p. 2 ) . starting point understanding complex economy 's main feature knowledge . refers particular type knowledge symbolic knowledge learned books tacit knowledge , embedded individuals , therefore , much difficult transfer . Moreover , individuals capable accumulating large amounts knowledge , society collectively wiser , needs several individuals specialized specific activities , tacit knowledge distributed coherent pieces among . , productive , knowledge needs diverse rightfully combined complex webs interaction . Hence , complex economies large networks people together vast quantities diverse relevant knowledge know combine use make knowledge-intensive products ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2014 ) . Considering characteristics knowledge dynamics need take place economic complexity exist , Balland et al . ( 2020 ) found , looking United States , complex activities concentrate disproportionately large cities complex place , urbanized vice-versa . happens big cities concentrate diversified human capital , institutions organisations create several opportunities complex activities happen . finding leads two critical considerations policy : ( 1 ) complexification , inequality large cities small cities/rural areas likely increase ; ( 2 ) megacities may important driver development , Chinese experience ( Balland et al. , 2020 ) . Naturally , type human capital location also influences economic complexity . According study Lo Turco & Maggioni ( 2020 ) labour content complex products , complexity highly intensive STEM knowledge ( Science , Technology , 8 research pieces cited 'The drivers economic complexity ' subchapter cited following subchapters use different versions ECI , methods controls arrive results . information mentioned throughout text consulted directly reference work . 14 Engineering Mathematics ) critical thinking , science mathematics skill requirements , means accumulation type knowledge skills encouraged order enhance complexity level industries , regions countries ( Lo Turco & Maggioni , 2020 ) . Looking demographics complexity , Bahar et al . ( 2019 ) , using sample 100 countries period 10 years ( 1990-2000 ) , showed birthplace diversity immigrant population country positively correlated economic complexity contributes diversity knowledge . case especially countries intermediate levels economic complexity considering high-skilled immigrants ( Bahar et al. , 2019 ) . Similarly , social inclusion LGBT strengthens innovative national capacity fostering accumulation human capital skills . Moreover , tolerance LGBT people population tends indicative tolerance towards technological innovation ( Vu , 2021 ) . addition , Nguyen ( 2021 ) found gender equality employment , education , health socio-economic political rights greatly beneficial economic complexity . looking employment , specifically , results demonstrate women 's participation industry service sectors positively correlated complexity . contrast , employment agriculture , self-employment vulnerable employment negatively correlated . arrive conclusions , author used panel data9 119 countries 1991 2017 ( Nguyen , 2021 ) . Hence , according available research , inclusive society , enables human capital development innovation , leading economic complexification . remaining relatively recent literature drivers economic complexity investigates influence internet usage , taxation , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , intellectual property rights/patents , financial development institutional quality , among others . surprisingly , Lapatinas ( 2019 ) found internet usage positive statistically significant10 complexity , suggesting increasing access internet could accelerate economic sophistication ( Lapatinas , 2019 ) . Regarding taxation , Lapatinas et al . 9 “ Panel data analysis refers statistical analysis data sets consisting multiple observations sampling unit . could generated pooling time-series observations across variety cross-sectional units , including countries , firms , randomly sampled individuals households . also encompasses longitudinal data analysis primary focus individual histories ” ( Lavrakas , 2008 ) . example , works cited monograph , panel data used analyse relationship changes countries ’ economic complexity relation changes aspects throughout years decades . 10 “ Statistical significance determination relationship two variables caused something chance ” ( Kenton , 2022 , n.p. ) . 15 ( 2019 ) tried understand fiscal policy better fostering economic complexity looking evidence Organisation Economic Co-operation Development ( OECD ) countries . found economies rely less capital taxation labour taxation tend sophisticated negative correlation capital taxes economic complexity stronger high-income countries . ( Lapatinas et al. , 2019 ) . evidence mixed case inward FDI11 . study Javorcik et al . ( 2018 ) Turkey ’ manufacturing sector 2006 2009 indicates FDI may serve catalyst complexification economy , small less sophisticated firms ones benefit . However , positive technological/knowledge spill effect occurs FDI present downstream sectors12 mostly multinationals industrialized countries ( Javorcik et al. , 2018 ) . Differently , broadening study correlation FDI economic complexity sample 117 countries 1995 2016 , Antonietti & Franco ( 2021 ) discovered greenfield FDI lead economic complexity countries certain characteristics : above-average levels income per capita , financial development , tertiarization above-average level tertiary-educated population . countries , knowledge-intensive greenfield FDI relate economic complexity . Therefore , clear correlation inward FDI developing countries ( Antonietti & Franco , 2021 ) . intellectual property rights patents , evidence also mixed . study 52 economies done Nguyen et al . ( 2020 ) found positive correlation patents economic complexity ( Nguyen et al. , 2020 ) . Sweet & Maggio ( 2015 ) , analysing Agreement Trade-Related Aspects Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPS Agreement ) , found positively correlated economic complexity countries already above-average level economic development complexity . developing countries , generally negative correlation , best , insignificant one , thus reinforcing global productive inequality ( Sweet & Maggio , 2015 ) . study Nguyen et al . ( 2020 ) also identified short-run positive relationship financial development economic complexity , efficient financial market 11 Inward FDI refers foreign direct investment received location , two types : greenfield mergers acquisitions . biggest difference two types first implies creation new business , second refers buying merging existing company ( Hintošová , 2021 ) . 12 “ Downstream operations refer final processes production sale goods , finished products created sold consumers ” ( Downstream Operations , 2020 , p. n.d. ) . 16 offers alternative funding possibilities productive activities . long run13 relationship becomes negative large financial market add sophistication diversification economy ( Nguyen et al. , 2020 ) . Finally , last cited contribution drivers economic complexity work Vu ( 2022 ) , approached influence institutional quality . sample 115 countries using Economic Freedom World Index14 proxy institutional quality , author came conclusion higher-quality institutions lead higher economic complexity since well-functioning inclusive institutions would lead human capital accumulation ( better-educated population ) , innovative entrepreneurship allocation human resources productive activities ( Vu , 2022 ) . easy imagine states institutions compose relevant impact productive capacity country , study influence institutions economic complexity almost inexistent constitutes huge gap research opportunity within field . 4 . Economic complexity economic growth briefly mentioned first subchapters , one important contributions economic complexity methods empirically proved strong association economic complexity economic growth . Several scholars confirmed correlation using different evidence , metrics versions ECI , briefly mentioned section . Besides basilar already cited work Hidalgo & Hausmann ( 2014 ) , works Zhu & Li ( 2016 ) , Stojkoski & Kocarev ( 2017 ) , Gala et al . ( 2018 ) Udeogu et al . ( 2021 ) show economic growth considerably related complexity countries ’ productive structures . scholars mentioned , Gala et al . ( 2018 ) ones use broadest set countries ( 147 ) largest period ( 1979-2011 ) . verify higher economic complexity , higher probability growth complexity partly explanatory divergence convergence among low- high-income countries . focus work show economic complexity corroborates structuralist 13 long run/long-term effect refers time span decades . 14 Economic Freedom World Index created Heritage Foundation composed 28 indicators classified five areas : size government ; legal systems security property rights ; freedom trade internationally ; access sound money ; regulation credit , labour businesses ( Vu , 2022 ) . 17 economic theory15 , strong Latin America 60s , advantage working evidence ( Gala et al. , 2018 ) . Zhu & Li ( 2017 ) made analysis based 126 countries 1995 2010 . investigated correlation economic complexity human capital economic growth , outcome : complexity strong explanatory relation growth . Nevertheless , saw human capital measured secondary tertiary education attainment still relevant role , indicating must combination ( Zhu & Li , 2017 ) . “ Ignoring cultivation human capital conducive improvement domestic production capabilities ” ( Zhu & Li , 2017 , p. 13 ) . last two studies focused reduced sets countries . Udeogu et al . ( 2021 ) used data 31 OECD countries covering period 1982-2017 test product complexity determines long-term economic growth , found complexity indeed determines growth long run ( Udeogu et al. , 2021 ) . Equally , studying relationship growth economic complexity 16 countries South-Eastern Central Europe , Stojkoski & Kocarev ( 2017 ) arrived similar conclusion works topic , economic complexity statistically significant explanatory variable growth long run , short run correlation ( Stojkoski & Kocarev , 2017 ) . growing literature linking economic complexity economic growth clearly indicates countries develop economically , need create implement strategies include even main feature complexification productive structures . relationship , however , linear simple , economic development nations also realized income growth distribution income . 5 . Economic complexity income inequality existing research relationship economic complexity income distribution income inequality confirms complexity strongly influences income inequality , positively negatively . Interestingly , works also show important factors influence relationship could moderate . 15 “ structuralist view usually stresses economic development strongly linked radical transformation structure production suppress obstacles , bottlenecks rigidities underdevelopment . Based hypothesis industrial structure affects rhythm direction economic development , structuralist literature highlights importance industrialisation process structural change necessary economic development ” ( Gala et al. , 2018 , p. 220 ) . 18 One influential studies relationship economic complexity economic inequality article Hartmann et al . ( 2017 ) . using cross-country evidence ( 150 countries ) 1963 2008 , found complexity negatively correlates income inequality . , complex country becomes , likely decrease level income inequality . specifically , one standard deviation16 economic complexity associated reduction Gini Index17 0.03 points . Another interesting contribution work development creation Product Gini Index ( PGI ) associates products levels income inequality ( Hartmann et al. , 2017 ) . words , “ understanding determinants income inequality simple since income inequality depends variety factors , economy ’ factor endowments , geography , institutions , social capital , historical trajectories , changes technology , returns capital ” ( Hartmann et al. , 2017 , p. 76 ) . Still , level economic complexity country reflective productive structure also features dynamics , geographic features , human capital institutions . , economic complexity also partly explain income inequality ( Hartmann et al. , 2017 ) . hand , Lee & Vu ( 2019 ) obtained contrary results investigating relationship . Using sample 96 countries 1980 2014 , found economic complexity associated increase income inequality long term ( Lee & Vu , 2020 ) . Chu & Hoang ( 2020 ) corroborated economic complexity associated higher income inequality using panel data 88 countries 2002 2017 . However , also observed economic complexity could associated less income inequality certain thresholds education , government spending trade openness met ( Chu & Hoang , 2020 ) . scholars also indicate relationship country 's level economic complexity level income inequality positive negative , moderators influencing factors consider . example , Fawaz & Rahnama-Moghadamm ( 2019 ) , using panel data 129 countries 1964 2013 , found : ( 1 ) average level 16 “ standard deviation average amount variability dataset . tells , average , far value lies mean . high standard deviation means values generally far mean , low standard deviation indicates values clustered close mean ” ( Bhandari , 2022 , paras 1 2 ) . 17 Gini index , Gini coefficient , measure income distribution across population . index ranges 0 0 % ( perfect equality ) 1 100 % ( perfect inequality ) ( Hayes , 2022 ) . 19 income inequality top 10 trade partners influences country 's level income inequality ; ( 2 ) trading economic complex countries correlates reduction income inequality ( Fawaz & Rahnama-Moghadamm , 2019 ) . Following line , Lee & Wang ( 2021 ) investigated country risk could moderator relationship economic complexity income inequality . employing panel data 43 countries 1991 2016 , concluded country risk subdivision areas ( economy , politics , finance others ) relevant complexity-inequality nexus . economic complexity positively associated lower income inequality low country risk ( Lee & Wang , 2021 ) . synthesis , economic complexity good predictor source economic growth , also contribute lowering average level income inequality country , taking consideration influencing variables . Nevertheless , still two types inequalities addressed far : inequalities within among countries , could easier see adverse effects relatedness due concentration knowledge urban regions countries . Brazil China serve examples understand relationship complexity income inequality within countries . Morais et al . ( 2021 ) used panel data 27 regions Brazil 2002 2014 . results showed relationship economic complexity income inequality inverted U-shape , complexity increases , income inequality also increases decreases afterwards . relationship , however , mediated region 's development level , especially considering urbanisation gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita . Thus , regions need reach development threshold feel benefits economic complexity reducing income inequality ( Morais et al. , 2021 ) . Regarding China , Gao & Zhou ( 2018 ) concluded economic complexity negatively correlates regional income inequality studying firm data 70 industries 31 provinces 1990 2015 ( Gao & Zhou , 2018 ) . However , zooming intra-regional level based export data income survey data , Zhu et al . ( 2020 ) found economic complexity contributes reduction regional income inequality urban areas , deepening urban-rural divide existent China barriers inhibit flow capital labour cities rural areas . authors pointed Chinese government needs aware rural-urban divide develop strategies make complexity beneficial rural urban populations ( Zhu et al. , 2020 ) . 20 similar dynamic case income inequality among countries . Within regions , nations able complexify economies others lag behind , case Europe . data industries patents 283 regions 32 European countries 15 years , Pinheiro et al . ( 2022 ) saw already complex places benefit economic complexity able diversify ( even ) complex activities . locations benefited focus low-complex activities , creating spatial inequality feedback loop ( Pinheiro et al. , 2022 ) . greatest challenge , however , certainly low- middle-income countries catch become economically developed , nations able far . Countries “ stuck ” income level long time said ‘ income trap ’ ( Felipe et al. , 2012 ) . Latin American countries good examples phenomenon . middle-income countries long Asian European countries , latter afterwards able become high-income countries , Latin American countries remained income level ( Jankowska et al. , 2012 ) . Scholars studying income trap see complexification productive structures way countries develop economically , therefore , crucial part solution income trap ( Felipe et al. , 2012 ; Hartmann et al. , 2020 ; Jankowska et al. , 2012 ) . , seen previously , achieving goal simple may seem . Fortunately , work economic complexity scholars increasingly providing helpful , specific practical policy guidance . Jankowska et al . ( 2012 ) , example , said “ small medium-sized developing countries dependent external markets driving productive development , PDPs18 need guided appropriate temporary incentive structures , line factor endowments , coherent relevant complementary policy areas ” ( Jankowska et al. , 2012 , p. 43 ) . Pinheiro et al . ( 2022 ) , side , said complexity take place peripherical countries region Europe European Union ( EU ) , governments stakeholders need pursue complexification upgrading existing activities diversifying time developing less complex activities creating new jobs areas build existing local capabilities . challenging task requires prior efforts , could : ( 1 ) development local knowledge education infrastructure ; ( 2 ) establishment linkages regions ; ( 3 ) attraction skilled migrants ; ( 4 ) establishment new research collaborations ; ( 5 ) 18 Productive development policies . 21 attraction external firms ; ( 6 ) improvement institutional governance ( Pinheiro et al. , 2022 ) . Finally , important contribution used policy guidance work Hartmann et al . ( 2020 ) . comparing experiences countries complexified productive structures became economically developed ( e.g . Ireland , Singapore South Korea ) got `` stuck middle '' ( e.g . Brazil South Africa ) , able identify done differently two groups could way developing countries ( Hartmann et al. , 2020 ) . According authors , first group smart industrial policies enabled identify use windows opportunities digital electronic sectors promote acquisition endogenous skills access international knowledge sources . latter kept gravitating towards simple economic activities , coherent industrial policies suffered social fragmentation . countries want develop economically plan development industrial policies promote economic complexity , considering principle relatedness identifying windows opportunity enter new industries markets right time ( Hartmann et al. , 2020 ) . 6 . impact economic complexity beyond economy economic complexity taken development strategy part , impact societal issues beyond economic growth income inequality must considered . Scholars recently started study correlation complexity environmental social matters gender inequality , health crime . studied subject far impact economic complexity environment , surprising taking consideration improvement productive structures presupposes use resources energy climate change today one biggest challenges , bigger , global society face . looking economic complexity environmental protection goals , could assume impossible achieve , seem contradictory . However , existing studies shown relationship straightforward . Romero & Gramcow ( 2021 ) demonstrated study , using data 67 countries 1976 2012 greenhouse gas emissions intensity , complex products associated lower emissions , consequently , complex countries tend pollute atmosphere less ( Romero & Gramkow , 2021 ) . specifically , “ increase 0.1 economic complexity index generates 2 % decrease next period ’ emissions kilotons 22 CO2 per billion dollars output ” ( Romero & Gramkow , 2021 , p. 1 ) . Boleti et al . ( 2021 ) arrived similar conclusions studying overall environmental performance countries relation economic complexity levels . Using Environmental Complexity Index 88 countries 2002 2012 , saw higher complexity leads better environmental performance . However , also leads lower air quality ( Boleti et al. , 2021 ) . side , according study Dogan et al . ( 2019 ) analysed CO2 emissions 55 countries 1971 2014 , economic complexity increased emissions lower higher middle-income countries controlled emissions high-income countries ( Doğan et al. , 2019 ) . Similarly , Khezri et al . ( 2022 ) investigated role economic complexity determining renewable energies affect CO2 emissions using sample 29 countries Asia Pacific 2000 2018 . corroborated economic complexity increases emissions increases scale production energy demand . Yet , time , using solar wind energy sources helps reduce emissions countries lower complexity ( Khezri et al. , 2022 ) . Thus , complexity negative economically developing countries positive already developed ones . precise , complexity longer harmful environment certain threshold . Neagu ( 2021 ) gave practical example : carbon emissions start decreasing , France reach threshold 1.6 ECI , Italy 1.45 , Finland 1.9 Belgium 1.4 . validates Environmental Kuznets Curve ( EKC ) , idea complexity growth lead increase environmental degradation decrease high complexity level achieved ( Neagu , 2021 ) . , one side , desire right countries develop , urgent need curb emissions preserve environment arrive irreversible situation resource crises environmental disasters global scale . relationship economic complexity income inequality , scholars believe economic complexity compatible environmental protection moderated institutions policies . Ahmad et al . ( 2021 ) , example , investigated impact institutional quality19 relationship economic complexity footprint20 20 emerging economies 19 index created PRS Group covers bureaucratic quality , law & order , internal conflicts , ethnic tensions , demographic accountability , control corruption , government stability , external conflicts , military politics , religious tension , socio-economic conditions , investment profile ( Ahmad et al. , 2021 ) . 20 Ecological Footprint metric fast consume resources generate waste compared fast nature absorb waste generate resources ( Ecological Footprint , n.d. , n.p. ) . 23 1984 2017 , outcome work environmental footprint reduced moderated institutional quality . Moreover , also validated EKC hypothesis recommended countries combine solid environmental protection framework acceleration complexification process growth sustainable ( Ahmad et al. , 2021 ) . academics expressed concern negative impact economic complexity environment proposed series policies growth development take place ecologically sustainably . Khezri et al . ( 2022 ) provided several specific recommendations work , : regarding energy use , complex countries focus production renewable energy , processes optimisation structural changes industry prevent CO2 emissions ; less complex countries lack capabilities transition renewable energy production use , direct attention supply demand well industrial strategies reduce emissions innovate ( Khezri et al. , 2022 ) general , also recommend countries start using expanding ecological technologies carbon capture utilisation implement environmental policies subsidies incentives renewable energy infrastructure , green technology investment carbon tax . Moreover , considering general interest curbing global warming stated Paris Agreement , countries knowledge green technologies consider transferring less complex countries ( Khezri et al. , 2022 ) . Neagu ( 2021 ) made less significant contribution sense . scholar advised companies industrial units integrate energy considerations early stages product design , , invest ecological technologies . Furthermore , industries analyse potential impact starting operation design ways mitigating foreseeable negative impact . Regarding governments , national commitment realistic plan reduce carbon emissions incorporate regulatory financial measures ( Neagu , 2021 ) . Nevertheless , shifting current productive models ecological ones simple . end , environmental protection also economic decision . sense , Mealy & Teytelboym ( 2020 ) observed green products grown fraction total trade last twenty years . inform countries real possibilities become complex environmentally coherent , therefore , provide guidance creation policies industrial strategies toward transition , authors created Green Complexity Index ( GCI ) Green Complexity Potential ( GCP ) . GCI gives 24 information countries ' current capabilities producing ecological products , GCP shows countries ' potential complexification ecological products ( Mealy & Teytelboym , 2020 ) . far research complexity environmental protection arrived , researchers tend agree goals mutually achieved efforts made avoid degradation complexification process . However , offer ecological products investment greener technologies take place , government private sector need change approach , demand side public opinion also matter . According Lapatinas et al . ( 2021 ) research , economic complexity shapes cultural values beliefs related environmental protection . Hence , suggest countries want implement measures reduce degradation aware cultural barriers find right incentives policies successful among population ( Lapatinas et al. , 2021 ) . , turning attention discussions impacts complexity social issues , , mentioned previously , studies related gender equality , health crime . respect gender , scholars investigated role complexity gender inequality education formation gender roles . Saâd Ella ( 2019 ) used data Gender Parity Index education ECI period 1984-2014 concluded economic complexity reduces gender inequalities education , especially tertiary level taking consideration global sample ( Saâd & Ella , 2019 ) . Zanaj ( 2021 ) found economic complexity correlated female emancipation knowledge accumulation favours egalitarian attitudes , low levels complexity compatible back-lashing gender roles . However , attitudes towards gender relate women 's position within household . Concerning position public sphere , opinions inclusive places high levels complexity . study based responses 64.954 individuals 59 different countries ( Zanaj , 2021 ) . Overall , said existing studies economic complexity negatively related gender inequality promotes education investment human capital . According research Vu ( 2020 ) , economic complexity also leads better health outcomes since , average , complex countries enjoy better outcomes less complex ones . arrive results , used panel data 103 countries 1970 2015 , proxies health outcomes different mortality rates life expectancy . Furthermore , found better health outcomes related strengthening employment opportunities ( Vu , 2020 ) . Finally , Madni & Khan ( 2019 ) identified 25 research economic complexity led decrease violent crimes using panel data 34 countries 2000 2014 . coincidently , also observed positive impact crime reduction could also related increased employment opportunities ( Madni & Khan , 2019 ) . fact , Adam et al . ( 2021 ) analysed economic complexity indeed led increased employment opportunities looking annual data OECD countries 1985 2008 averaged data 70 countries 1990 2010 . confirmed complexity leads less unemployment employment , contradicting belief technological development would induce loss jobs ( Adam et al. , 2021 ) . short , according current findings , economic complexity related improving health outcomes diminishing crime , partly creating employment opportunities people entail possibility satisfying basic needs . 7 . Economic complexity human development Still investigating impacts economic complexity besides economy , last subchapter dedicated literature review relationship complexity human development , research theme approximated thesis topic , research complexity human rights far . According United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) , human development goes beyond income growth distribution focuses people , freedoms choose act , opportunities ( UNDP , n.d. ) . known used measure human development nowadays Human Development Index ( HDI ) composed three dimensions : health , education income ( UNDP , n.d.-a ) . Currently , little research complexity-human development nexus , extensive influential work written far doctoral thesis Hartmann ( 2014 ) . book , author reflected insufficiency naiveness picking one single approach understand development since humanity inevitably complex dynamic treated . explained society achieve social progress , needs sustained convergence human development approach , final goal free dignified life human beings , structural economic change innovation since approaches enough ( Hartmann , 2014 ) . empirical research relationship , using sample 121 countries 772 economic sectors , also able conclude complexity indeed makes 26 fundamental contribution social welfare even relevant contribution economic growth . contribution directly translated providing new social occupational choices ; distributing economic political power ; thus , favouring democracy ; making economic system robust shocks . However , complexity also adverse effects human development , loss former capabilities also increasing costs decision processes could affect people 's well-being ( Hartmann , 2014 ) . Hence , needs well planned implemented strategy combines complexification economy measures face possible adverse effects process also measures focused fulfilment immediate needs ( e.g . health , food shelter ) creation capabilities enables people agents change creation networks innovation lead positive , inclusive sustainable development ( Hartmann , 2014 ) . author ’ words : “ promote high standard social welfare , policy makers must find , cooperation actors involved , appropriate balance seemingly contrary forces specialization diversification , related unrelated variety growth , regional national policy-making cooperation competition . Indeed terms necessarily contrary ; , fact , complementary forces development . , crucial involve open prolific manner social policy makers , civil society sectors central improvement human development ( education , health regional development agencies ) industrial policy-making process , promote mutual understanding different interests needs different groups promote interactive learning innovation ” ( Hartmann , 2014 , pp . 6–7 ) . scholars also contributed research line publishing empirical studies complexity human development relationship . Lapatinas ( 2016 ) studied whether economic complexity could considered cause human development . Using data 126 countries 1965 2005 1970 1995 HDI proxy human development , arrived result causal relationship established . mean complexity impact human development relationship evolves dependence variables ( e.g . institutional set-up economy , time , type level diversification ) ( Lapatinas , 2016 ) . sense , Le Caous Huarng ( 2020 ; 2021 ) found mediators relationship complexity human development . first study , scholars analysed mediating effect income inequality developing countries using data 87 nations 1990 2017 . found , general , economic complexity positively correlated human development correlation partially mediated reduction income inequality ( E. Le Caous & Huarng , 2020 ) . recent work , studied 27 mediation effects logistics international migration using data 117 countries 1990 2017 . results also positive case , logistics relevant moderator positive cases , international migration significant countries already high HDI ( Le Caous & Huarng , 2021 ) . One last contribution understanding relationship worth mentioning work Ferraz et al . ( 2018 ) . authors measured efficiency Asian Latin American countries transforming economic complexity human development . analysis based 26 countries , covering four years , 2010 2014 , using data longevity , education , sanitation employment measure human development . results showed complex countries , case , Asian countries , efficient transforming complexity human development outcomes ( Ferraz et al. , 2018 ) . Considering latest research , possible conclude economic complexity important component driver human development , correlation income inequality environment , complexity inherently positive negative . Instead , impact depends idealized implemented stakeholders variety influencing factors known still unknown scholarship . end , still long path better understanding relationship complexity human development , even HDI , even convenient measure extensive available data , limited represent human development . Hartmann ( 2014 ) said , study relationship opens new possibilities think development provide policymakers , civil society companies new insights foster development ( Hartmann , 2014 ) . fact , economic complexity already guiding industrial development policies around world . examples Europe ’ Smart Specialization Strategy , Canada ’ Superclusters Initiatives China ’ special economic zones . countries United States , Italy , Mexico , Russia , Australia , Turkey , Spain United Kingdom used economic complexity study productive structures ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) . Therefore , crucial understand better effects people ’ agency , freedom , opportunities well-being . 28 Chapter II – Economic complexity , development human rights 8 . Human development human rights Currently , research relationship economic complexity social issues limited literature cited Chapter . themes treated far gender inequality , education , health outcomes , violent crimes human development , last comprehensive . , lack studies capture entire scope human development , taking consideration , example , dimensions provided Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) constitute guide internationally , least current decade . way , studies correlation human rights respect , protection promotion economic complexity . recent article introducing special issue economic complexity , written references theme , acknowledges existence gap : “ would interesting explore broader social justice issues , social cohesion human rights protection , change countries acquire productive capabilities become complex . complex products sustainable social sense require deeper forms human cooperation correlated greater social cohesion rights ? ” ( Balland et al. , 2022 , p. 6 ) . Therefore , master thesis aims contribute filling gap investigating relationship economic complexity human rights , parting premise economic development achieved economic complexity strategy planned implemented taking consideration human rights preservation environment also final goal human well-being consonance rest planet . investigating relationship economic complexity human rights , necessary distinguish human rights human development since different concepts different implications , time , inexorably correlated . According founding document human rights regime , Universal Declaration Human Rights ( UDHR ) , human beings entitled set 30 fundamental civil , political , economic , social cultural rights reflect values freedom , non-discrimination , respect , tolerance , justice responsibility . Moreover , besides universal , human rights inalienable , indivisible , interdependent interrelated ( UN , 1948 ) . 29 human rights regime gradually came development human rights law , comprising two main human rights covenants – International Covenant Civil Political Rights ( ICCPR ) International Covenant Economic , Social Cultural Rights ( ICESCR ) – together UDHR form so-called International Bill Human Rights , human right treaties protocols regulate specific issues ( e.g . Convention Rights Child Convention Relating Status Refugees ) , well resolutions , guidelines , declarations principles help guiding states understanding , respecting implementing legal instruments ( OHCHR , n.d.-a ) . Moreover , regime composed international regional monitoring bodies courts oversee member-states implementation compliance agreements ( OHCHR , n.d.-b ) . Human development , side , approach economics field study created Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq , popularized work Indian economist Amartya Sen adopted United Nations ( UN ) guide organization ’ work development . approach takes people protagonists beneficiaries development focuses creation opportunities people enhance capabilities expand freedom choose ( HDRO , 2015 ) . According UNDP framework , human development approach composed following dimensions : possible see diagram human rights considered UNDP necessary create conditions development , elements also directly indirectly paired basic human rights right life , health , education , non-discrimination , freedom opinion expression , right assemble right democracy cite . Figure 3 : Diagram dimensions human development .
