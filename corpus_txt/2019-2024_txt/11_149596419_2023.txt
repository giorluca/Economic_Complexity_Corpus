Sincethe 1940s , Lösch ’ work practically oriented Central Places Theory ofhis close colleague Walter Christaller adapted spatial planners differentcountries Sweden , communist Poland , Israel ( Trezib 2014 , Venhoff 2000 ) .Christaller ’ contributions national socialist spatial planning well documented , political opportunism successive memberships leftist USPD/SPD , national socialist NSDAP , communist KPD centre left SPD . Lösch ’ sbiography less well known character seems much complex , ambiguous , constant quest meaning life also relatable . Thus , life constitutesa suitable historical case study reflecting manifold application possibilities ofspatial economics authoritarian even totalitarian temptations scientistsmight face today.1920 G.
