Introduction Work presented bi-annual world conferences International Schumpeter Society traditionally stressed notion economy complex evolving system . view strong roots work Schumpeter , developed view 30-year period , Theorie der wirtschaftlichen entwicklung Capitalism , Socialism Democracy . aim keynote address provide brief outline notion complexity used developed post-Schumpeter literature . Partly broad concept , multiple ways complexity characterized elaborated . propose literature roughly divided two parts : one deals economy complex evolving system , later one uses term complexity develop set methods uses disaggregated data develop aggregate summary measures aim capture key characteristics below-aggregate dynamics . two strands literature seem strong connections . briefly discuss two strands complexity research . Section 2 deals earlier literature focuses disequilibrium economic evolution , Section 3 looks “ new ” economic complexity literature . Section 4 , briefly reach field so-called big history , uses similar notions disequilibrium evolution . use section make plea return addressing big issues economics , particular sustainability climate change , focusing systemic properties , way Schumpeterian economics provides alternative mainstream equilibrium view . Section 5 , summarize main line argument . 2 . Complexity Schumpeterian economics core Schumpeter ’ economic thinking innovation driving factor dynamics evolution economic system . mainstream economic theory sees economic dynamics equilibrium process tends steady state , Schumpeter stressed role disequilibrium , even though inspired equilibrium system proposed Walras . Theorie der wirtschaftlichen entwicklung ( Schumpeter , 1911 ) , published German revised language 1926 , translated English 1934 ( Schumpeter , 1934 ) , contains comprehensive description role equilibrium disequilibrium theory.1 central role Schumpeter ’ disequilibrium process played entrepreneur , introduces innovation ( “ new combinations ” ) economy . innovations create disequilibrium , illustrated reference Walrasian theory . 1 Becker Knudsen ( 2002 ) provide overview argument changed two German one English editions , also provide translations German parts appear original English translation . 2 Walrasian general equilibrium , actions various economic agents lead state incentives change , behaviour optimal . subsequent body general equilibrium theory ( Arrow Debreu , 1954 ) argues , competition brings profits uniform ( relatively low ) rate return capital . Schumpeter ’ entrepreneur disrupts equilibrium creating higher profits means innovation . Schumpeter ( 1939 ) saw ( major ) innovation clustered time , “ bandwagons imitation ” gradually eroding large profits innovation initially bring . process innovations disrupting equilibrium imitation gradually bringing equilibrium back leads long business cycles ( see also literature closely followed Schumpeter ’ ideas 1970s onwards , e.g. , Mensch 1979 ; Freeman et al. , 1992 ) . However , economy always out-of-equilibrium , equilibrium steady state seems come reach , disrupted innovation . setting , tools economic equilibrium theory little use . neo-Schumpeterians ( e.g. , Dosi et al. , 1988 ) started looking alternative ( modelling ) tools . found inspiration natural sciences , especially field thermodynamics systems theory ( see , e.g. , popular account Prigogine Stengers , 1984 ) . view , equilibrium-based mainstream economics viewed emulation physics steady state equilibrium embraces ( Mirowski , 1991 ) , theory dissipative systems thermodynamics line notion disequilibrium Schumpeterian thought . key dissipative systems open , i.e. , exchange energy matter environment . closed thermodynamic system subject irreversible process increasing entropy , see entropy “ degraded energy ” results waste heat transformed work . stylized example steam engine , may imagine heat form steam ( water molecules ) boiler separated cold area . Work performed letting heat flow cylinder , thereby moving piston sets wheel motion . engine closed system , i.e. , keep firing boiler coal oxygen brought outside , engine stop working heat transformed entropy , corresponds mix cooled water molecules environment . process irreversible ( entropy transferred back heat closed system ) , high-entropy state represents equilibrium . dissipative system avoid thermodynamic equilibrium entropy maximized , bringing energy outside . means dissipative system operates ( far ) equilibrium , , Prigogine Stengers show , dissipative systems often exhibit structure , order dynamic stability . idea attracted neo-Schumpeterians search dynamic disequilibrium theory reflecting Schumpeter ’ ideas . key idea ( Verspagen , 2005 ) Schumpeterian disequilibrium dynamics , world looks radically different mainstream equilibrium-based 3 steady stage growth process everything grows constant rate ( e.g. , Solow , 1956 ; Romer , 1990 ) . neo-Schumpeterian focus dissipative systems situated broader field complex systems so-called self-organization . words Silverberg ( 1988 , p. 531 ) : theory self-organisation deals complex dynamic systems open environment terms exchange matter , energy information composed number interacting subsystems … Many systems shown … lead spontaneous emergence coherent macroscopic structures … seemingly uncoordinated behaviour component parts microscopic level . Moreover , self-organising systems undergo succession … structural transformations . roots earlier work natural sciences ( Silverberg discusses , among others , Eigen , 1971 ; Haken , 1983 ) , gained momentum 1990s , partially influence Santa Fe Institute brought together scholars range ( social ) sciences , united application complex systems idea fields ( popular early accounts research field Lewin , 1992 Waldrop , 1992 ) . quotation Silverberg emphasizes , main idea complex systems theory interaction micro level ( economics , e.g. , interaction individual firms , firms consumers ) , uncoordinated higher-level structures , may lead order aggregate level , either form structurally stable outcomes ( economy operating near full employment ) , dynamic equilibria characterized change . aggregate ordered outcomes systems interacting agents ( complex systems ) often called emergent properties system . Fuentes ( 2014 ) provides formal definition emergent property discontinuity effective complexity measure along particular property . Emergent properties also become key focus so-called Agent-Based Models ( ABMs ) , attempt formally model simulate micro-level interactions complex systems , order observe emergent properties aggregate level ( early overview , see , e.g. , Tesfatsion , 2002 ; see Dosi et al. , 2010 application Schumpeterian dynamics ) . title Waldrop ’ popularizing book ( Complexity . emerging science edge order chaos ) suggests , field complexity science closely related mathematical field chaos theory ( see Gleick , 1987 Ruelle , 1991 early popular accounts ) . chaos theory , nonlinear dynamic models produce unpredictable outcomes hyper-sensitive initial conditions . Thus , model simulated two sets initial conditions ( large number decimals ) similar may produce two different outcomes periods simulation . weather seen standard case type chaotic behaviour ) . 4 Chaos extreme example disequilibrium , Langton ( 1990 ) suggests part continuum types systems behaviour , also emergent properties complex systems lie . draws work Wolfram ( 1984 ) , shows cellular automata may produce different types behaviour , reaching homogenous state , periodic structures ( cycles ) , chaos , “ long transients ” ( Langton , 1990 , p. 16 ) . Langton shows cellular automata may parameterized , varying key parameter encounter phase transition periodic chaotic dynamics , behavior either end … spectrum seems “ simple ” easily predictable , behaviour vicinity phase transition seems “ complex ” unpredictable . ( Langton , 1990 , p. 24 , original emphasis ) . suggested title Langton ’ paper , led idea complexity phenomenon lives “ edge chaos ” . Frenken ( 2006 ) provides relatively early survey ideas complexity applied field Schumpeterian analysis innovation economic change . distinguishes three main categories : fitness landscapes , networks , percolation models . category fitness landscapes , NK landscape model ( Kauffman Weinberger , 1989 ; Kauffman , 1993 ) represents evolution search ( local ) peaks landscape . NK landscape N-dimensional tuned terms number peaks displays parameter K. larger K , “ rugged ” landscape , difficult becomes find global optimum “ walking landscape ” . NK model used Levinthal ( 1997 ) represent Schumpeterian innovation management science context . Another example Frenken Nuvolari ( 2004 ) , apply model early history steam engine . second category complexity approaches distinguished Frenken ( 2006 ) network models . distinguishes approaches model networks agents ( mostly innovating firms ) , well networks technologies . networks agents category , small worlds model ( Watts Strogatz , 1998 ) particularly influential . approach path length evolves function network structure , particular “ cliquishness ” , cluttered network terms densely connected local neighbourhoods . Path length seen representative , example , easily technological knowledge flows network . small worlds model , path length declines rapidly cliquishness decreases marginally , reminiscent phase transition identified Langton . Another type networks discussed Frenken endogenous networks , theory explains formation network links agents . example principle preferential attachment , leads networks centrality ( many links node ) distributed nodes highly skewed way ( so-called scale free networks , see Albert Barabási , 2002 ) . 5 Finally , Frenken ( 2006 ) distinguishes models based percolation separate category approaches . models used either adoption innovation , dynamics technology development . latter category , Silverberg Verspagen ( 2005 ) perceive innovation movement 2-dimensional lattice , one dimension represents technological distance , technological performance . Feasible technologies represent unbroken chain lattice , R & performed firms find new “ sites ” existing chains . yields innovation size distributions skewed , corresponding empirical reality many incremental innovations observed , radical ones . Frenken ’ survey include agent-based models ( ABMs ) , models primarily aimed economic phenomena economic growth industrial dynamics . already stressed , ABMs especially relate strongly complexity idea focus emergent properties . Full scale ABMs Schumpeterian innovation analysis preceded smaller simulation models , example Silverberg et al . ( 1988 ) , look industrial dynamics dynamic economy endogenous innovation , Silverberg Verspagen ( 1994 ) , look long waves innovation economic growth . Pyka Fagiolo ( 2007 ) provide early survey literature . recently , Schumpeterian ABMs addressed traditional macroeconomic issues , e.g. , Dosi et al . ( 2010 ) . 3 . “ new ” paradigm economic complexity work complex systems certainly still buoyant , also fields innovation economics economic geography , term complexity especially “ economic complexity ” predominantly used distinct subfield economic literature . “ economic complexity theory ” ( Hidalgo , 2021 ) “ new paradigm economic complexity ” Balland et al . ( 2022 ) call . review article field , Hidalgo ( 2021 , p. 92 ) refers six “ scholars [ ] long recognized economies complex systems ” . six , would place least first four ( Beinhocker , 2006 ; Holland & Miller , 1991 ; Miller , 1991 ; Kauffman , 1993 ) complex systems literature briefly summarized previous section . suggests continuity literature reviewed previous section new economic complexity literature . hand , Hidalgo ( 2021 , p. 93 ) argues “ economic complexity … seen continuation endogenous growth theory ” cites Romer ( 1990 ) Aghion Howitt ( 1992 ) examples theory . , already referred Romer ( 1990 ) example type equilibrium theory odds Schumpeterian idea disequilibrium . Aghion Howitt , hand , explicitly refer Schumpeterian ideas creative destruction , authors repeatedly referred work part “ Schumpeterian growth theory ” . However , wish 6 put exclusive claim Schumpeter ’ ideas , also fair say Schumpeter ’ idea disequilibrium , summarized , part models ( see Alcouffe Kuhn , 2004 similar argument ) . Similarly , Balland et al . ( 2022 ) argue “ economics difficulty studying technology . tended measure consequences : shift parameter aggregate production functions measures total factor productivity ... provide connection consequences causes ” . flat-out ignorance Schumpeter-inspired work endogenous innovation , well equilibrium oriented endogenous growth theory Hidalgo refers . particular ignores neo-Schumpeterian complexity literature summarized , criticizes mainstream economics treatment technology 35 years prior Balland et al . ( 2022 ) , subsequently built wide catalogue alternative approaches . terms theoretical building blocks , new economic complexity idea based notion capabilities , i.e. , order produce ( successfully export ) particular products , specific productive technological capabilities must attained . capabilities must acquired economic agents ( firms ) , requires resources dynamic process . idea capabilities also important tenet Schumpeterian literature ( see , e.g. , Fagerberg et al. , 2010 overview topic macro point view ; Dosi Teece , 1998 take micro perspective ) . new economic complexity literature adds idea relatedness ( Frenken et al. , 2007 ) capabilities . “ relatedness measures affinity location activity ” ( Hidalgo , 2022 , p. 97 ) , activities also share capabilities . implies relatedness seen predictor activities location may newly develop , i.e. , require capabilities location already possesses activities currently undertakes . idea relatedness closely related “ local search ” firms . example , Nelson Winter ( 1982 ) suggested firms generally change routines small steps , Levinthal ( 1997 ) models local search walking local paths NK landscapes imagined Kauffman Weinberger ( 1989 ) . Sahal ( 1981 ) Dosi ( 1982 ) argue innovation efforts firms aimed incremental improvements basic design , suggests local search . Although capabilities relatedness basic ideas underlying new paradigm economic complexity , central elements development literature . early complexity literature summarized previous section puts lot emphasis elaborating theoretical features economy works , likely outcomes market process terms growth distribution , new economic complexity literature takes specific interest issues . Instead , Hidalgo specifies basic aim achievement new literature development relatedness complexity metrics , describes estimating “ availability , diversity sophistication factors inputs present economy … Unlike 7 previous approaches economic growth development , … relatedness complexity methods agnostic nature factors . Instead , try estimate combined presence , without making strong assumptions factors may ” ( Hidalgo , 2021 , p. 92 ) . Balland et al . ( 2022 , p. 3 ) argue metrics “ add toolbox economics ” offering dimensionality reduction technique tailored problem innovation related development ( also stressed Hidalgo , 2021 ) . Dimension reduction refers process ( micro ) data collapsed ways mere aggregation , preserving information aggregation would preserve , thus highlighting important properties system aggregate level would remain hidden mere aggregation . Thus , information contained proposed ( reduced ) metrics “ useful predicting economic growth , income inequality , greenhouse gas emissions ” ( Hidalgo , 2021 , p. 92 ; point also made overview Balland et al. , 2022 ) . data reduction use reduced measures seem main point new complexity literature , rather arriving theoretical understanding economy works , would seem useful compare outcomes proposed complexity measures data reduction methods . Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) well-known method data reduction , applied widely . Although clearly different Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) proposed Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) , , modified form , become standard literature , also striking similarities technical workings two methods ( Kemp-Benedict , 2014 ) . methods draw spectral decomposition ( i.e. , eigenvectors ) matrix , computed product ‘ ’ normalization/ standardization common matrix ‘ ’ normalization/standardization transpose M.2 difference ways matrix transpose normalized/standardized.3 present brief comparison two methods dataset international trade ( value exports ) year 2012 , covering 155 countries 1,224 product classes 4-digit Harmonized System classification system appendix . use methods map countries product space , latter defined two main dimensions derived method . PCA , two first principal components . ECI , use second third eigenvector complexity matrix ( first eigenvector trivial ; details , see appendix references ) . ECI method less without theory , see 2 matrix Revealed Comparative Advantages ( RCA ) , elements indicate extent given country ‘ specialized ’ given product . 3 PCA standardizes columns ( rows transpose ) z-scoring , ECI normalizes individual columns transpose respective column sums . 8 reason interpretation restricted second eigenvector , hence also include third . Overall , comparison shows PCA ECI provide useful data reductions , provide insights characterizes developed countries relative less developed countries terms trade patterns . one would use metric correlation GDP per capita , ECI ( second eigenvector ) provides best result . However , without theoretical question goes beyond asking highest possible correlation , seems little reason prefer either PCA ECI method . 4 . Complexity “ cosmological question ” idea complexity related dissipative systems ( hence parallel thermodynamics ) also plays large role field big history ( e.g. , Spier , 2005 , 2011 ; Chaisson , 2014 ) . Big history aims write coarse history universe since big bang , ( necessarily ) zooming general level . operationalized study emergence evolution complexity , complexity defined thermodynamic sense . Spier ( 2005 , 2011 ) proposes measure complexity energy density ( amount energy flow per unit mass ) . Building theory dissipative systems , complexity arises small regions universe ( like planet Earth ) state low entropy ( = high complexity ) persists . “ compensated ” parts universe entropy increases , leading net increase entropy universe whole . Spier proposes emergence life first stage complexity , followed emerging civilization including economy culture . Spier ’ view , increasing human complexity closely related increasing energy density systems . Aunger ( 2007 ) links interpretation big history Schumpeterian ideas cycles , , example , Schumpeter ( 1939 ) Freeman Loucã ( 2001 ) . views big history series punctuated equilibria , separated so-called non-equilibrium steady state transitions . transitions initiated energy-related innovation ( e.g. , use machinery 1st Industrial Revolution ) , coupled organizational innovations ( e.g. , factory system ) , “ control ” larger societal system ( e.g. , form institutions ) . punctuated equilibrium sequence reminiscent Schumpeterian theory socio-economic paradigms ( Freeman Perez , 1988 ) , regulation perspective Boyer ( 1988 ) . emphasis energy entropy also reminds us Georgescu-Roegen ( 1971 ) ecological economics followed . highly abstract big history reasoning hard apply economics , obvious counterpart use entropy economic theory . big history ( thermodynamics generally ) , order complexity correspond low entropy 9 state . Although entropy concept used economics ( indicator structural diversification ) , meaning big history literature , hence used generic measure complexity . systemic evolutionary approach Schumpeterian complexity economics seems appropriate address big societal challenges comprehensive way . Heilbronner ( 1984 , p. 682 ) called cosmological problem economics , namely , social configurations production distribution-if , macro micro patterns-that ultimately emerge self-directed activities individuals . problem first resolved Adam Smith extraordinary depiction society generated spontaneous activity tendency toward internal order `` external '' expansion . remarkable Marx , Keynes , Schumpeter among proposed resolutions problem imagination scope comparable Smith-but resolutions differ one another almost totally . Marx 's great schema system destined pass successive crises alter socioeconomic texture gradually set stage likely final collapse sort . Schumpeter 's view , dynamics system give rise prospect long-term , continually self-generated growth-not quite `` hitchless '' growth Smith 's model-but growth dependable powerful enough form basis Schumpeter 's `` plausible capitalism . '' Keynes trajectory much less certain depends outcome tug war animal spirits entrepreneurs constraints saturable markets propensities thrift-a tug war whose outcome , however , remedied appropriate government intervention . seems unescapable current day age , Heilbronner ’ cosmological problem must include sustainability , i.e. , must concern social configuration production , distribution , well living environment . seems us Schumpeterian view economy complex , evolutionary system particularly well equipped include sustainability analysis ( see , e.g. , Gowdy , 2013 ) . time , probably also true contradiction , one hand , Schumpeter ’ early , optimistic view innovation stimulating growth , compatibility growth sustainability hand . unbridled capitalism early Schumpeter may well come point overstepping planetary limits . Thus , may another transition Schumpeter ’ ( 1942 ) “ plausible capitalism ” . Whereas Schumpeter ( 1942 ) saw capitalism moving direction socialism , time need transition aimed “ sustainability ” instead “ socialism ” . Academic work Schumpeterian tradition complexity able enlighten us sustainable economic system , society large , may function , role played system entrepreneurs , workers , consumers , governments . likely , line older debates economics , Schumpeterian theory built complexity different much useful equilibrium theories dominant mainstream . 10 5 . Conclusions outlook Complexity guiding principle enables natural scientists social scientists alike build disequilibrium theory development evolutionary systems . major inspiration economists working Schumpeterian tradition , particular International Schumpeter Society . Complexity also chosen summary concept recent economic literature deals relatedness diversification . However , argued paper , “ new ” literature , meaning term complexity different earlier Schumpeterian literature , real effort new literature connect Schumpeterian ideas . Rather , refers use set new original data reduction techniques . see development complexity topic Schumpeterian community opportunity extend understanding disequilibrium leads ordered patterns evolutionary economic systems , i.e. , propose keep building “ old ” complexity ideas . also see ideas disequilibrium evolution potentially fruitful theoretical basis “ new ” economic complexity literature . way , data reduction techniques developed “ new ” literature may find new fruitful applications , become better founded theory . Without foundation yield precise research hypotheses built theory , value proposed data reduction techniques may remain limited ad hoc . However , , argue complexity idea needs applied big societal challenges , first foremost climate change sustainability . Schumpeter celebrated visionary “ grand views ” functioning capitalism . views well summarized applied complexity literature economic evolution . Schumpeter also aware systems produce history , i.e. , path dependent show irreversible structural transformations . Schumpeter witnessed changes organization innovation , led Capitalism , Socialism Democracy . current generation scholars witness transition sustainable economy , integrate theory Capitalism , Sustainability Democracy .

Comparison economic complexity index principal components analysis methods ( PCA economic complexity index ) implemented dataset international trade ( value exports ) year 2012 , covering 155 countries 1,224 product classes 4-digit Harmonised System classification system . calculate Revealed Comparative Advantage ( RCA ) indicator ( scaled continuously [ 0,1 ] interval ) country product class . PCA analysis , 1,224 products considered variables , 155 countries observations . look first two principal components data ( factor scores ) . constructed weighted averages country ’ RCA , using factor loadings weights . loadings two eigenvectors corresponding two leading eigenvalues correlation matrix variables . two principal components capture 35.2 % total variance RCA data . top panel Figure 1 plots 155 countries space corresponding two principal components . words , without data reduction , 155 countries represented 1,224-dimensional space , plotted 2-dimensional space . economic complexity measure , first create row-normalized column-normalized version comparative advantage matrix ( RCA values arranged products countries ) . row-normalized version created dividing element matrix sum column ( sum RCA values country ) , column-normalized version created dividing element sum row ( sum country ’ RCA values product ) . create new matrix pre-multiplying column-normalized version matrix transpose row-normalized version . matrix plays similar role complexity calculation correlation matrix product RCAs PCA . first eigenvalue matrix equal 1 , eigenvector belonging identical values product . Hence may consider trivial case , divert attention second-dominant eigenvalue.4 Product complexity defined eigenvector belongs second-dominant eigenvalue matrix . country ’ Fitness calculated weighted average country ’ RCA values , using eigenvector weights.5 Hence see similarity PCA use eigenvectors weights RCA . 4 iterative procedure proposed Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) converges first eigenvector , Hidalgo ( 2021 ) proposes use second-dominant eigenvalue associated eigenvector . 5 , one may transpose original RCA matrix , normalize multiply way , derive Fitness eigenvector belonging second-dominant eigenvalue matrix . two ways equivalent . Figure 1 . Data reduction PCA ( top panel ) economic complexity ( bottom panel ) 17 complexity literature limits second-dominant eigenvector , considering “ Economic Complexity Index ” ( called Fitness ) . However , N – 1 non-trivial eigenvectors , reason exclusively focus second-dominant one . Therefore , similar use first two principal components Figure 1 , plot countries 2-dimensional space corresponds Fitness1 Fitness2 , use second- third-dominant eigenvector , respectively . two eigenvalues used correspond 9.1 % sum eigenvalues , first eigenvalue ( equal 1 ) corresponds another 28.7 % . reduce original RCA data two dimensions , could obtain 1-dimensional measure preferred new complexity literature using horizontal axis Figure 1 . principal components fitness measures correlated : PC1 Fitness1 R = 0.807 , PC2 Fitness2 R = –0.611 . Nevertheless , clear differences two data reduction methods . One principal components orthogonal ( zero-correlated ) construction , Fitness measures . show mild positive correlation , indicated dotted trendline . correlation ( ) far complete , clear second eigenvector adds information , relative first . appears economic complexity method , like PCA , faces trade-off degree data reduction ( i.e. , lowering number eigenvectors ) information present reduced data . thing immediately catches eye data reduction measures yield part 2-D space cluttered , i.e. , group countries similar values dimensions . happens different parts 2-D space : PCA method , mostly developing ( low income ) countries , economic complexity method , mostly developed ( rich ) countries present clutter . Thus , method provides useful insights depends group countries one interested . comparison two data reduction methods , impossible judge one “ better ” . one wants take correlation ( log ) GDP per capita yardstick , economic complexity index ( Fitness1 ) performs better first principal component . However , also Fitness2 subsequent Fitness3 ( documented Figure 1 ) also significant multiple regression GDP per capita . technical interpretation , Fitness correlates stronger GDP per capita principal component ( ) Fitness tends stress differences poorer countries ( cluttering Figure 1 ) , variable growth rates ( per capita GDP levels ) . However , literature offer strong theoretical logic would happen , therefore empirical superiority either measure remains largely undecided .
