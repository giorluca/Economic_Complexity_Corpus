However , commonly accepted scheme forecast growth GDP country –i.e . understand dynamics economic growth . Recently , new discipline called Economic Complexity ( EC ) ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , PNAS , 106 ( 26 ) , 10570-10575 , 2009 ) gaining momentum within field , wherecomplex-systems methods used provide innovative ways assess growth potential country throughdata science . Within EC analyses , metrics provided economic competitiveness countries possess– hence potential growth – analyzing international trade goods products around globe , focusing particular products country exports . EC metrics provide proxy future economicgrowth country extracting productive knowledge ( consisting human environmental resources , capabilities finances ) country owns . metrics require simple input , represented thebipartite network countries products exported . Moreover , measures share deep relationship withstandard centrality metrics , help unveiling features underlying network structure ( Sciarra etal. , Scientific Reports , 9 , 15269 , 2018 ) . Different EC metrics introduced , including ( Tacchella et al. , Scientific reports , 2 , 723 , 2012 ) .We analyze main differences metrics , lens complex network theory , theaim understand capacity metrics serve proxies economic growth , also ofthe potential environmental footprint country ’ economy . exemplify approach consideringthe impact water resources ( terms water footprint ) production export agricultural goods , special attention examine link external water footprint country economicfitness . results show economic complexity play key role shed light new facets globalwater resources , revealing interesting relationships economy environment , necessary bettercomprehension climate change dynamics may result useful policy makers .
