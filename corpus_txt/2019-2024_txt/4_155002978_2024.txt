Emphasizing importance time believed neglected neoclassical equilibrium theory , central earlier Veblenian institutional literature , North went argue beliefs individuals , groups , societies hold determine choices consequence learning time – span individual ’ life generation society learning embodied individuals , groups , societies cumulative time passed intergenerationally culture society ( Ibid . ) “ learning time ” embodied historical evolutionary account institutions cultures ( see Zouboulakis , 2005 ; Alston Mueller , 2014 ; Greif Mokyr , 2017 ; Ambrosino , Fontana , Gigante , 2018 ; Greif , 2021 ) . Understanding involved explaining passage time accumulated effects markets economies . effect , past laid institutional structures shaped present future . Thus , North critical neoclassical economics , contributed revival Old Institutional Economics . Yet large agenda , one proceed ? One pathway North became increasingly interested complexity theory made time central . North saw time systematically investigated Santa Fe Institute Santa Fe , New Mexico , undertaken multidisciplinary investigation complex adaptive systems . Complex adaptive systems neither chaotic random deterministic like equilibrium systems . Complex adaptive systems exhibited structures evolved slowly time also changed time . fit North ’ understanding market systems depended institutions evolved . 1 Special thanks go Mauro Boianovsky paper conceived developed . 3 Santa Fe Institute initially focused sciences economics , new program complexity economics initiated 1987 Nobel Prize economist Kenneth Arrow Nobel Prize physicist Philip Anderson brought together ten economists ten physicists investigate parallels complex adaptive systems thinking physics economics . conference produced volume essays entitled , Economy Evolving Complex System ( Anderson , Arrow , Pines , 1988 ) .2 Yet one conclusions conference virtually thinking economics saw economy evolving complex system . Indeed , physicists conference surprised neoclassical mathematical analysis , essentially optimization theory , fell well short kinds mathematical analysis physics employed . led development new program Santa Fe complexity economics 1988 . Arrow invited Stanford colleague Brian Arthur direct new program , second conference 1996 Santa Fe organized North invited . conference produced second volume essays , economy Evolving Complex System II ( Arthur , Durlauf , Lane , 1997 ) , North contributed chapter.3 shared assumption second conference volume complexity economics involves distinct approach economic analysis . investigates economic agents ’ actions , strategies , expectations change endogenously patterns structures create , thus recalled North ’ Nobel Prize lecture emphasis importance institutions complaint economics address role time played economic life . contrast neoclassical economics ’ equilibrium approach , complex adaptive systems approach ‘ nonequilibrium approach ’ also one investigated emergence order processes might seem chaotic . North , institutions could thus function basis adaptive processes operated . Though North write much complexity theory rest career , Santa Fe conference occasioned new themes arguments North ’ thinking . emphasized 2005 Understanding Process Economic Change , drawing specifically thinking two individuals , Paul David Brian Arthur , made concept path-dependence central complex systems functioned . David ( 1985 ) , economic historian , famously emphasized importance concept path-dependence describe markets often developed , using arbitrary QWERTY organization typewriter keyboard example . demonstrated technical choices often exhibited ‘ lock-in ’ effects later technological development thus key markets developed . Moreover , ‘ locked-in ’ technological changes necessarily 2 contribution distinctive describing complexity approach came John Holland , pioneered use genetic algorithms simulations explain complex systems . referred complex systems adaptive non-linear networks , assigned seven characteristics : overall direction economy determined interaction many dispersed units ; rarely global controls ; economy many levels organization interaction ; building blocks continually revised ; many niches adaptations occur ; niches created new technologies producing novelty ; economies operate far optimum ( 1988 , pp . 117-118 ) . 3 See Fontana ( 2010 ) history origins development Santa Fe economics program . 4 efficient . echoed North ’ change position regarding efficiency institutions . original view “ ‘ competition face ubiquitous scarcity dictates efficient institution ... survive inefficient ones perish ” ( 1981 , p. 7 ) .4 Yet cited publication using concept path dependency , argued inefficient institutions could persist , even competitive markets , costs difficulties moving one developmental path another locked ( 1990 ) . Arthur , training economics , engineering , mathematics , long-standing interest technology change innovation , emphasized principle increasing returns idea positive feedback loops argue small changes technological economic processes could later magnified , especially industries technology important significant network effects existed ( Arthur , 1988 , 1989 , 1994 ) . subsequently developed theory evolution technological change ( Arthur , 2009 ) . many currents complexity thinking economics fields ( Rosser , 2021 ) , North drew David Arthur point entry . integrated complexity framework institutional approach Hayek ’ emphasis cognition , drawing recent developments cognitive science especially associated idea influentially advanced Andy Clark institutions provide ‘ scaffolding ’ economic agents ’ cognitive behavior ( Clark Karmiloff-Smith , 1993 ) .5 chapter discusses North ’ later thinking institutions change influenced exploration complexity theory . Section 2 reviews thinking institutions markets prior developing interest complexity theory visit second Santa Fe Institute conference complexity economics . Section 3 discusses North drew upon complexity thinking , connects argument understanding central role belief evolutionary processes needs draw cognitive science , especially ‘ scaffolding ’ idea cognitive scientist Andy Clark . Section 4 looks important challenge economic thinking nature economic agency advanced Clark David Chalmers . Section 5 identifies North ’ hesitations complexity thinking , notes view difference economic political evolution , suggests may address potential problems applying cognitive science approach , provide fuller understanding view complex evolutionary processes . Section 6 concludes brief discussion North ’ late thinking social violence . 2 North institutions markets prior interest complexity theory North ’ early intuitions institutions stimulated travels observation institutions different societies emerged evolved . One particularly clear example 1961 visit Brazil served expert regional economic growth history delivered four lectures Rio de Janeiro , subsequent visit Latin America 4 Though note also added , “ world non-market decision making inefficient forms political structure exist long periods time ” ( Ibid . ) 5 Also see Clark ’ influential extensive discussion ‘ scaffolding ’ idea ( 1997 ) . 5 1980 asked take part measurement transactions costs Peru.6 struck several things : persistence inefficient institutions many countries , Latin America ’ comparative backwardness relative Western economies , divergent paths economic development . provided specific focus : ’ putting stress talks nature economic efficiency essential ingredient development . see Brazil ’ impressed simply concept efficiency . hodgepodge economic organization permit price system work well ’ know plan efficiently either . result : gigantic mess ( North 1961a , p. 14 ) . , indeed , someone trained neoclassical background could central standard economic reasoning concept efficiency ? North ’ Rio lectures , third issue also provocative . interpreted divergence especially occurring private social benefits costs , rejected application subsequently highly influential Coase theorem countries ( Coase , 1960 ) . one conceive legal structure firms groups could recapture gains incur costs affect groups therefore external economies diseconomies would part disappear , facts life social-political legal structure society makes external economies diseconomies real therefore makes different optimum effects exist . ( North 1961b , p. 41 ) . Quite early career , , North begun investigate tensions standard economic theory happened different national economies , especially developing world . early thinking consequently characterized balancing economics argued held number questions applied world . North initially studied subject doctoral degree American economic growth , influenced Simon Kuznets ( see Greif , 2021 ) . first book developed export-based growth model using US history ( North , 1961c ) . began investigate influenced technologies , led emphasis institutions , property rights , transactions costs . view ‘ good ’ institutions important growth produced low transactions costs , spurred innovation , specialization , capital accumulation . turn made role evolution institutions subject research , North undertook book Lance Davis ( Davis North , 1971 ) . Institutions , property rights , political developments affecting became focus North , case countries believed growth strong countries . position 6 See Boianovsky ( 2018 ) detailed account North ’ visit . much discussion section Boianovsky . 6 made clear book rise West Robert Paul Thomas ( North Thomas , 1973 ) . argued good institutions secured property rights lowered transactions costs efficiency effects relative prices . Institutions , , foundations made effective market process . standpoint , North began investigate caused departures state affairs , examining remarkable shift thinking ideologies , social norms , social values came picture . Importantly , created role different historical pathways , also affected geography ( North , 1981 , 1990 ) . general sense , meant , Veblenian tradition argues , history mattered . specific sense , meant path-dependence , beginning discussed economists , needed taken account . point entry North ’ later views introduction complexity thinking , later brought cognitive science attention . 3 North ’ later views drawing complexity cognitive science historian , North found David Arthur ’ attention path-dependance particularly important since suggested pattern , perhaps even causality , historical events came . lock-in idea David ’ keyboard example illustrates , Arthur ’ expression idea terms well-known economic law increasing returns positive feedback loops gave economic interpretation . shared idea small , often seemingly unimportant changes could significant long-term effects , redirecting economic development . contrary economics ’ reliance since least beginning twentieth century ( also earlier ) principle diminishing returns marginalist view economy changed predictably small increments . Given deep philosophical attachment thinking , North contemplating all-but revolutionary change thinking determined economics needed think complexity . Perhaps ironic since career achievements Nobel honor carried without systematic reflect saw David Arthur . unreasonable , , say represented turn thinking new excitement could said history . else important North David Arthur focus technological change , factor underlying neoclassical reasoning much examined economists . ideas , , began developed North ’ 1999 “ Understanding Process Economic Change ” lecture 2005 book title . Though may strong say standard thinking essentially functionalist technology – markets generally always functionally put resources best use – North nonetheless made point criticizing accepted thinking technology 1999 “ Understanding Process Economic Change ” lecture . understand properly yet , however , process applying science technology , changed human environment fundamentally . live world interdependence characterizes life . complexities 7 dealing different environments central getting handle issues concerned ( 1999 , p. 10 ) . Referring changes institutional matrices , argued path dependence results typically makes change incremental , although occasional radical abrupt institutional change suggests something akin punctuated equilibrium change evolutionary biology occur economic change well ( p. 11 ) . Technology change worked far complex ways thought . , , might one begin investigate adequately “ process applying science technology ” ? North , place start people construct beliefs nature reality . “ Beliefs way evolve heart lecture ” ( p. 13 ) . Paradoxically , beliefs shape perceptions reality , also product perceptions . However , together , suggested , refer us “ process change ” argued conceive “ circular flow ” “ turn leads creation institutional structure , institutional matrix , shapes ‘ world ’ ” ( p. 15 ) . Belief formation thus became foundation institutional development evolution . North emphasizes sort “ circular flow ” conception idea feedbacks involves really investigated economists , begun investigated “ Economists Santa Fe Institute , visited number times ” “ spend lot time modelling call complexity ” ( p. 16 ) . Central thinking , found , concept adaptive efficiency , “ mean ability societies adjust flexibly face shock evolve institutions effectively deal altered reality ” ( p. 17 ) . Turning longer 2005 Understanding Process Economic Change , North expands circular flow/feedback picture commenting history Soviet Union : “ story perceived reality ® beliefs ® institutions ® policies ® altered perceived reality ” ( 2005 , p. 4 ) . embeds conceptualization assertion live “ ubiquitous uncertainty non-ergodic world ” ( p. 8 ) . Uncertainty understood probability distributions events unavailable . Ergodic understood “ involving relating probability state recur ” ( p. 19 ) – non-ergodic thus absence probability given state recur . combination means live historical world changing time continually producing novel , path dependent-generated environments . argument , , originally institutions , particular well-specified property rights , product “ effort humans structure environment make predictable , ” North emphasizes “ effort frequently make increased uncertainty players ” ( p. 15 ) . meant “ essential question must ask makes rules objectives ” ( Ibid. ) . added : perceived reality consequent beliefs ? keeping critical analyses Soviet attempts organize economy according single plan , North saw hopeless , unrealistic endeavor . Yet contrast many argued , North ’ 8 concern instead perceived reality beliefs attempted impose over-arching plans told us important things uncertain , non-ergodic economies evolve . forms basis North ’ increasing interest cognitive science , relatively recent domain thinking psychology time . North emphasized London lecture said important “ delve mind brain work , subject cognitive science ” ( 1999 , p. 13 ) . repeated 2005 book saying “ way perceive world construct explanations world requires delve mind brain work – subject matter cognitive science ” ( 2005 , p. 5 ) . cases notes Hayek exceptional early recognizing , especially connection argument economies inherently decentralized processes , 2005 North also draws special attention recent contributors cognitive science , particularly Andy Clark . North drew Clark idea brain world ‘ collaborate ’ address computational informational needs , collaboration generates material structures world act like ‘ external scaffolding ’ human decision-making . North quoted Clark follows . external scaffolding policies , infrastructure customs strong ( importantly ) result competitive selection , individual members , effect , interchangeable cogs larger machine . larger machine extends way outside individual , incorporating large-scale social , physical , even geopolitical structures ( North , 2005 , p. 37 ; Clark , 1997 , p. 182 ; emphasis added ) . North ’ earlier thinking made rules , formal informal , foundation institutions , examined created incentive structures facilitate impede market processes . attention complexity theory made perceived reality/beliefs connection important determinant rules institutions . attention complexity theory also increased concern uncertainty non-ergodicity left historical change evolution economies chaotic hoped . Complexity economists ’ response concern economies could produce unexpected changes taking form phase transitions , still best understood complex adaptive systems . Clark ’ scaffolding idea offered way explain , institutions seen externalized products people ’ past perceptions reality beliefs , North used idea frame second half book . Broadly , argues world continually changing people ’ plans policies often ( always ) achieve intended , institutions nonetheless anchoring character made change adaptive rather chaotic . time , Clark ’ thinking put focus beliefs , North gave central importance – “ Beliefs way evolve heart theoretical issues book ” ( North , 2005 , p. 18 ) – tying beliefs institutions manifestation world . Clark influential psychology cognitive science explicitly located human cognition outside human bodies tangible embodiment social structures . idea human cognition occurred inside human bodies goes back hundreds years Descartes , 9 continues motivate much thinking contemporary psychology . However , Clark rejected assumption proposed see thought also embodied world , embodiment result human efforts create cognitive structures facilitate people ’ thinking , allowing brain world ‘ collaborate ’ address computational informational needs . collaboration also motivated people ’ need economize limited , cognitive capacities advantages creating division labor cognitive processing increasingly complex world . example , hand calculators taken ‘ scaffolded ’ many mathematical activities formerly minds , allowing us effect ‘ off-load ’ activities focus cognitive tasks . Much applies statistical analysis reliance computers empirical research . North , economizing division labor motives made traditional economic reasoning central . standard economic reasoning seemed ignore belief formation , nonetheless processes behind beliefs formed depended importantly two economic principles . Yet North ’ acceptance uncertainty non-ergodicity could fit economic analysis institutions framed complex adaptive system terms , Clark ’ ambitions regarding human beings raised philosophical issues potentially challenge long-held arguably foundational assumptions economics regarding individuality Homo economicus . issue discussed next section . 4 Cognitive science ’ challenges fundamental assumptions economics Clark argued cognition occurs outside individual minds structures external individuals , also individuality/agency exists outside individual minds structures external individuals – co-author David Chalmers termed ‘ extended self ’ conception . provocative paper , ask : “ , finally , self ? extended mind imply extended self ? ” ( Clark Chalmers , 1998 , p. 18 ) . answer : seems . us already accept self outstrips boundaries consciousness ; dispositional beliefs , example , constitute deep sense part . , boundaries may also fall beyond skin ” ( Ibid. ) . view really radical cognitive science community already critical Cartesianism . Indeed , say self spills world also view also held many social science , particularly sociology social psychology . potentially radical idea prospect individuality agency exists world outside human individuals relatively independent way . self spills world conceivably takes existence active way separate individuals . Descartes , recall , famously said , ‘ think , therefore exist. ’ Yet thinking/cognition also occurs outside cognitive structures individuals created ‘ off-load ’ various types cognitive activities – economizing , division labor sort process – say thinking cognition outside individuals also refers us ‘ individual agents ’ alongside human individuals traditionally understood ? 10 fact , idea hardly unfamiliar economic life since existing legal structures countries treat firms individuals . Economics since marginalist revolution accorded sorts ‘ individuals ’ status secondary derivative human individuals arguing collections individuals functioning individuals seen constructions individuals . Ontologically speaking , individual people real individuals . Yet time economics explains behavior collections individuals firms using optimization analysis accords individual people . However , Clark Chalmers ’ thinking possibly even stronger import . Thus , might said individuality agency spill world creating new types individuals , new types individuals conceivably take supplant roles played individuals traditional sense . possibility implicit ‘ off-loading ’ idea , draws economizing-division labor rationale . ‘ off-load ’ cognitive activities onto structures external us , accord individuality agency way diminishes formerly exclusive role played human individuals.7 , , becomes issue North since strongly embraces cognitive science ‘ off-loading ’ idea later institutional thinking . Indeed , 2005 book uses idea extensively show societies work manner complex adaptive systems . mechanism emphasizes evolution social beliefs seen ‘ off-loaded ’ driver institutional change . social beliefs take existence independent individual beliefs , command well ? consequently change role human individuals economic life ? Anticipations North ’ grappling issue present long held view one clear changes evolution markets shift personal exchange , people “ know parties exchange , small numbers , ” impersonal exchange , “ know party , never going see , neither side particular hold ” ( 1999 , p. 21 ) . impersonal exchange market organization economies successful due creation economic institutions constrain cheating , lying , stealing . keeping idea impersonality , enforcement structured treat people irrespective personal characteristics differences . Thus , one might infer happens increasing importance impersonal exchange human individuals , identified personal characteristics , supplanted institutionally constructed individuals , identified market characteristics . latter individuals gain weight importance , former diminish regard . However , seems odds traditional conception Homo economicus seen agent personal characteristics interacts markets grounds market process . Homo economicus , , casualty ‘ off-loading ’ cognitive science emphasis beliefs North ’ “ perceived reality ® beliefs ® institutions ® policies ® altered perceived reality ” evolutionary logic ( 2005 , p. 4 ) ? 7 Clark-Chalmers view discussed connection cognitive science ’ embodied distributed cognition literature Davis ( 2024 , ch . 8 ) . 11 might entirely argued connection North doubts Santa Fe complexity program . , , hesitations regarding approach ? possible implications understanding evolutionary change ? 5 Complexity thinking North set aside One thing North saw over-reaching Santa Fe approach strong mathematical bent – complaint also regarding postwar development neoclassical economics . came part influence physical natural sciences early development complexity thinking , example , first Santa Fe conference . Thus , physical environments appear conceptually tractable “ vastly complex human environment , ” “ appear fundamental ‘ power laws ’ social sciences comparable physical sciences ” ( 2005 , p. 16 ) . Whereas physical world appears “ constant therefore timeless ” social world “ non-ergodic – world continuous novel change ” ( Ibid . ) , methods need different foundations . Note describing Santa Fe approach , Fontana ( 2010 ) distinguishes three interpretations complex dynamic systems : dynamic complexity essentially mathematical approach , computational complexity focuses cognitive foundations economy computational cognitive skills decision makers , connective complexity emphasizes social interaction ( 2010 , pp . 187-8 ) . North clearly favors second , sees little opportunity economics first . third arguably fine-grained capture interest institutions . special advantage second , , allows one argue direction character evolving economic systems highly open , albeit steadying properties created economic institutions rules generate . Consider , , chapters 4 5 2005 book build North ’ emphasis cognition go discuss nature economic change . Chapter 4 focuses intentionality consciousness , North sees two levels : primary level immediate awareness higher order level involves agents ’ awareness actions attitudes ( p. 39 ) . latter level distinguishes human life susceptible lawlike analysis uncertain world constant institutional change . North think understand ? “ place begin explanation genetic architecture evolved several million years humans evolved hunters gatherers ” ( p. 45 ) . , North suggests human beings begun earliest beginnings display particular path cumulative change . cumulative change materialized institutions built less successfully upon one another become increasingly determinative human life proceeds . Chapter 5 , “ Scaffolds Humans Erect , ” refers us institutions made rules enforcement characteristics . change evolve continually determine ‘ rules game ’ across endlessly changing cultural contexts ( p. 48 ) . Concomitant rules belief systems support “ norms , conventions , internally held codes conduct ” ( p. 50 ) . must , however , learned , North notes Hayek ( 1960 ) emphasized . Nonetheless , learning smooth free ideological conflict ( see Ambrosino Fiori , 2018 ) . 12 guarantees “ evolutionary progress economic growth – change ” ( p. 61 ) . “ Individuals different backgrounds interpret evidence differently consequence make different choices ” ( p. 62 ) , means path institutional development always open certain degree . understanding , last part book North provides interpretation scaffolded open world . returns shift personal impersonal exchange overcame important “ stumbling block ” institutional change , also emphasizes giving people ’ repeated dealings individuals places special burden construction political institutions undergird economic ones ( pp . 117-118 ) . political institutions involve ? particular virtue liberal , democratic societies “ creation stable consensual polity ” “ put place formal rules [ addressing ] disappointment , say disaster ” ( p. 161 ) . Specifically : “ essential conditions consensual polity exist , development institutional rules provide greater transparency polity enable effective monitoring polity ” ( p. 164 ) . contrast , authoritarian societies likely produce political institutions produce chaotic disruptive kinds change . One way , , understand North ’ thinking complexity historical emergence impersonal forms exchange produced two types evolutionary processes , one involving economic institutions one involving political ones . liberal , democratic societies , economic institutions exhibit relatively clear cumulative development rules , norms , enforcement procedures . authoritarian ones , cumulative development rules , norms , enforcement procedures least less stable worst subject chaotic reversals change . liberal , democratic societies , political institutions possess cumulative development rules , norms , enforcement procedures ; authoritarian societies less stable , often chaotic development occurs . However , important see North see evolution political institutions duplicating movement personal impersonal conceptions individuals sees occurring evolution economic institutions . fact , liberal , democratic societies goal build political institutions treat people way irrespective different characteristics also respect different personal characteristics . Putting evolution economic political institutions together , two interacting , reciprocally supporting pathways evolutionary change . evolution economic institutions effect determines ‘ rules game ’ everyone evolution political institutions preserves “ Individuals different backgrounds interpret evidence differently consequence make different choices ” ( p. 62 ) . , consequently , North likely saw thinking Santa Fe participants idea complexity analysis envisions single evolutionary process rather idea two interacting evolutionary processes . Fontana ’ history Santa Fe economics conferences describes second North attended strongly heterodox motivated critique neoclassical economics . Thus , may important many participants demonstrating economy per se worked unitary complex evolutionary process . Indeed , distinction economic political evolutionary processes seem 13 absent conference , idea different processes interact complex ways seems well . perspective , let us go back potentially radical implications Clark Chalmers ’ view individuals agency . North , case made shift personal impersonal modes exchange indeed works supplant human individuals economic processes . Yet view evolution political institutions preserves key role human individuals personal differences one another . evolution economic political institutions work together tension one another subject investigation . say regarding North ’ hesitations complexity theory believed needed use complexity thinking explain institutional evolution complex dynamically appears Santa Fe participants imagined . put difference North others product historical sensibility natural physical science orientations . History certainly complex , North thought institutional thinking provides broad guidelines explanation . North , course , well aware evolution political institutions often full reversals conflict . One way captures saying human intentionality source “ wonders human creativity ” also “ intolerance , prejudice , human conflict ” ( p. 42 ) . recurring manifestation historically latter outbreaks disruptive social violence . issue one gave attention last work , chapter turns closing . 6 Concluding remarks : problem violence North shows particular concern problem violence final , co-authored volume John Joseph Wallis Barry Weingast ( North et al. , 2009 ) . first explained political elites emerge sharing power among works time reduce social conflict generate rents monopolize . termed states affairs termed ‘ limited access orders ’ associated systems property rights , rules law , enforcement systems worked favor Yet social orders could generate instability rival elites sought acquire power . successful , often came violent measures social conflict . North , Wallis , Weingast argued many modern societies also created ‘ open access orders ’ promoted economic development , minimized violence changeovers dominant elites . Thus , evolution political institutions important determinant economic progress . time , many ways complex problematic sort process involved evolution economic institutions , since evolution governed reasonably clear principles could said evolution economic institutions ( always relative prices ) determinable costs benefits clear role.8 difference especially case light North ’ later cognitive science emphasis beliefs , ‘ ideology ’ sometimes put .
