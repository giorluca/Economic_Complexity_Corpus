EFC based export database various reasons , practical , due its1arXiv:2110.00302v1 [ econ.GN ] 1 Oct 2021homogeneity standardization across different countries , conceptual . idea deduce thecompetitiveness countries explicitly looking capabilities , inferring presenceof endowments indirect way , , looking final outputs , products suchcountries able export [ 11 ] . trivially , GDP predictions obtained EFC based onthe Trades indicate quantitatively better performance compared best conventional economicmodels [ 10 ] much lower data requirement.Unfortunately , Services included set available features UN-COMTRADEand , albeit available IMF database ( www.data.imf.org ) , neither usual analyses EFC , despite relevant growing fraction money flows channel Services [ 12 ] . firstattempt complement Services aforementioned analysis followed [ 13 ] , finding thatat aggregated scale Services tend complex respect Goods . However , authors complain high level aggregation may cause loss informationnecessary accurately separate Complexity Activities Fitness Countries.With deeper level aggregation , authors [ 14 ] show heterogeneous scenario theComplexity Activities , pointing complex Services cluster complex Goods . theEFC narrative clustering set Activities signal indicating participationof common intangible capabilities [ 3 ] , necessary competitive domains . However , either manuscripts select subset available economies World covering thedatabases implemented analysis present many missing features . Indeed , referencesconsider 116 countries , important missing economies China Great Britain.Recently , work Mishra collaborators [ 15 ] shows importance aggregate Servicesand Goods common database especially accounting properly economic relevance thedeveloping nations . Saltarelli et al . [ 16 ] use World Input-Output Database ( WIOD ) show thatexport mirrors remarkably well domestic production manufacturing sectors , relation fadesaway service related sectors . analyses , however , use limited number services sectorsbecause high number missing values present original IMF database ; limitation thatthe present work addresses.The analysis endowed previous works highlight purposes Services correctestimation competitiveness nations . However , reference database Services , theBalance Payments International Investment ( BOP ) data collected International Mone-tary Fund ( IMF ) [ 17 ] , presents weakness important missing scores , especially comparisonwith quality Goods database . Strikingly , actual IMF-BOP classification unsuitable forthe EFC analysis , presenting overlapping convoluted hierarchy sector . first core resultof present paper reconciliation quality two databases , Goods Services , obtained reclassifying IMF services sectors reconstructing missing elements BOP byusing comparing different machine learning techniques . best reconstruction method obtainedis used create so-called Universal database EFC , aggregating Services Goods 160countries total 124 sectors , providing largest set common nations sectors availablefrom BOP Trade datasets . Finally , Universal database used EconomicFitness Complexity analysis , obtaining two conceptual practical advances : ) statisticallyvalidated network universal sectors , practical use predict recommend newsectors development , ii ) computation Universal fitness , novel EFC indicator toassess competitiveness nations , including also services.MethodsThis section introduces database used later analysis , aggregating Goods Services ; inparticular , focus motivations methodologies adopted re-classificationof services reconstruction missing values.2Goods : International TradeFollowing definition IMF [ 17 ] , Good physical item commodity ownershipcan passed via transaction . Consistently , recorded customs available via UN-COMTRADE . Following standard approach EFC , reference database collecting scores ofthe Goods reconciliation International Trade database contained UN-COMTRADE [ 18 ] .It collects export flows classes physical products nations . classification theproduct follows Harmonized System revised 1992 ( HS92 ) , consisting 5040 sectors labelled by6-digits codes sub-heading level . temporal coverage database runs 1996 2018 , spanning slightly two decades , made available 169 countries corresponding tothe principal economic players World.The statistic codes 6-digits present level details statistics comparable tothe orders magnitude data Services . also worthy note HS classificationvaries time available years relevant modification happens 2007 . Perhaps , suchmodification induced re-balance sectors 6-digits create non-uniform transition infew low complexity codes [ 19 ] . Therefore , aggregate classification closest comparisonto Services database , 2-digits classification . Note choice also mirrors therespective weight international trade [ 12 ] . Furthermore , 2-digits classification 97 codes , remove one sector ( code 99 , Commodities specified according kind ) itdoes represent well defined sector low impact overall exports.Services : description classification issuesAccording IMF [ 17 ] , Service result production activity , facilitate exchangeof Goods , financial asset . Therefore , Services usually non-separable items beseparated production . Service database based Balance Payments andInternational Investment ( BOP ) data collected International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) [ 17 ] 1 . TheBOP database offers three measures Services : credit , debit net values . comparisonwith measure available Goods , select credit indices , since correspond exportedservices . Two closely related classifications present : full BOP classification implemented bythe IMF alternative alpha-numerical classification reported metadata . full BOPclassification based composite nature codes Services presents keydrawback analytical purposes accounted . fact , possible sum sonsof code total value larger assigned value parent . misleading situationhappens classification may implement different methodologies order generate thehierarchy.In order explain situation discuss example regarding case sons ‘ Transport Services ’ ( ‘ STR ’ codes ) dis-aggregation considers kind transportationimplemented nature transported Goods . visual inspection , figure 1 shows networkof transport ’ codes , highlighting two dis-aggregation paths blue red . Remarkably , onlythe blue codes sum value parents . Instead , red nodes sum availablevalue parents , although possible using hierarchical tree obtained codesdoes account properly red classification.Contrarily , alternative classification maintains single hierarchical structure removing thedouble methodologies , quality corroborated fact sum values thesons return value parent codes . want stress scenario two methodologiesderives misleading interpretation indices offered IMF error theirimplementation database , since possible reconstruct correct structure . presentthe first three main layers aggregations summable classification figure 2 .

Theuse alternative classification discussed allows derivation full hierarchy recon-structing complete subset leafs summing indices ( red-circled indices figure 2 ) .

Moreover , following assume not-missing value raw database correct , thus also entries zero value labelled correct . basic easily interpretable recon-struction technique given linear interpolation temporal series forward direction , i.e . generating elements exists previous information . Therefore , linearinterpolation assumed reference method , giving relatively good results despite simplicityof method . Successively , consider two families methodologies : Random Forest class andthe Nearest-Neighbour imputations [ 20 ] class.The Random Forest consists ensemble decision trees [ 21 ] trained optimize entropyof reconstruction . Rather , decision tree single non-overlapping subdivision spaceof features , i.e . values series , distinct regions following hierarchical ordering ofthe feature-selection tree structure [ 22 ] . Since splits tree randomly chosen , ispossible derive many different decision trees forming statistical ensemble .

Finally , reconstructed set , truncatedbetween 1996 2018 , aggregated 2-digits UN-COMTRADE data so-calledreconstructed Universal database.The Economic Fitness Complexity input matricesThe various Economic Complexity measures computed starting quantities derived theexport data . raw export volumes directly used essentially two reasons : ) triviallydepend sizes sector country ii ) provide assessment thecompetitiveness given country exporting product . order overcome limitations , Revealed Comparative Advantage ( RCA ) , introduced Balassa [ 25 ] , commonly used theliterature . formula , RCA country c activity computed : RCAc , =Ec , a/∑a Ec , a∑c Ec , a/∑c , Ec , ( 1 ) Ec , value Product Service sector ( generically call activity ) , inconstant US dollars , exported country c.

Recent attempts tried integrate thestandard UN-COMTRADE database physical Goods IMF BOP database collecting theService data [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] . However , two problems prevented necessary achievements reach levelof data control sanitation comparable Goods-only data . Firstly , IMF classification israther convoluted , , suitable direct application EC framework , themain issue related structure classification tree . Secondly , significant presence of13missing values different scales aggregation prevents realization satisfactory level detailof classification , forcing use various gimmicks arrange data . instance , Stojkoski etal .
