Afterward , sec-tion 3 demonstrates model presented NP-hard , section 4 provides concluding remarks . 2 Problem definition formulation imperfect production process basis planning problem produces perfect quality items , called serviceables , also fraction 𝛽 defectives items . units reworked serve demand initially perfect quality items .

Similar models , assume unit production costs neg-ligible processes , see [ 6 ] . Finally , objective planning problem minimise sum total cost , comprises holding setup costs .

Notation 3 proof NP-hardness show problem single-item dynamic lot-sizing rework defectives NP-hard . reduced well-known PARTITION problem , found [ 7 ] : Problem PARTITION : given positive integers 𝑎1 , … , 𝑎𝑛 , exist set 𝑆 ⊂ 𝑁 = { 1 , … , 𝑛 } ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑖∈𝑆 = ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑖∈𝑁∖𝑆 . Moreover , proof based [ 4 ] , use following parameters : 𝛽 = 0.5 𝑅𝑝 = 1 𝑅𝑟 = 1 ℎ𝑠 = 3 ℎ𝑑 = 0 Due 𝛽 = 0.5 , half demand fulfilled production directly half rework : 𝛽 ∑ 𝑝 = ∑ 𝑟 . setup costs equal ( 𝑅𝑝 = 𝑅𝑟 = 1 ) defectives stored cost ( ℎ𝑑 = 0 ) , reasonable store one serviceable one period ( ℎ𝑠 = 3 ) . Even non-optimal approach producing reworking simulta-neously one period would lead better result storing one serviceable one period . parameters set due technical purposes : 𝑇 = 𝑛 complexity economic lot-sizing problem rework defectives 3 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑎𝑡 1 , … , 𝑇 𝑎𝑡 > 0 1 , … , 𝑇 𝑎𝑡 ≤ 𝛽 ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑡−1𝑖=1 2 , … , 𝑇 Hereby , condition 𝑎𝑡 ≤ 𝛽 ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑡−1𝑖=1 required enough defective items available rework time . production option always possible , rework needs sufficient stock defective items satisfy demand . Without condition , must probably production satisfy 𝑎𝑡 may enough defective items available rework option . remanufacturing model , similar assumption exists , returns already available 𝑡 = 1 guarantee remanufacturing option always available . Based parameters , optimal solution planning problem generates total costs 𝐶 = 𝑛. Consequently , either production rework satisfy demand . Likewise , serviceables stored . Let us assume production rework one period one rest . demands positive every period ( 𝑎𝑡 > 0 ) , total cost would exceed 𝑛 = 𝑇 . Let us assume one serviceable stored one period . item transferred next period , total costs reduced least 2 . Hence , storage serviceables . Finally , end situation either production rework one period , . Also , storage serviceables time . planning problem presented paper reduced PARTITION problem . answer PARTITION positive , means solution PARTITION problem 𝑛 positive integers 𝑎𝑛 𝐴 = 𝑎1 , 𝑎2 , … , 𝑎𝑛 form two subsets 𝑆 ⊂ 𝑁 𝑁 ∖ 𝑆 ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑖∈𝑆 = ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑖∈𝑁∖𝑆 . One subsets contains periods production used meet demand , subset contains periods rework used storage serviceables . Contrary , subsets match , must least one period production rework necessary , total cost would exceed 𝑛 = 𝑇. Conversely , instance solution PARTITION problem . 4 Concluding remarks investigated complexity model imperfect production process rework defectives . Various models remanufacturing already proven NP-hard . best knowledge , paper first address model rework defectives . could show problem reduced well-known PARTITION problem , NP-hard .
