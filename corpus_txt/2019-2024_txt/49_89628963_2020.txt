However , MST topology pandemic differs details volatile periods . Keywords : complex systems ; cryptocurrencies ; multifractal analysis ; detrended cross-correlations ; minimal spanning tree 1 . Introduction Whether complexity system viewed purely intuitive sense nontrivial order emerges spontaneously overall disorder grasped formally using one several dozen mathematical , physical , information-theoretic measures , surrounded signatures face Entropy 2020 , xx , 5 ; doi:10.3390/exx010005 www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy ar X iv :2 00 9 . 10 03 0v 1 [ q -fi n.S ] 2 1 ep 20 20 Entropy 2020 , xx , 5 2 28 manifestations almost everywhere . complex : live society complex interact others complex way . exaggeration statement society complex structure known us universe . Social phenomena like emergence communication cooperation , build-up hierarchies organizations , opinion formation , emergence political systems , structure dynamics financial markets among iconic examples real-world complexity [ 1–3 ] . Specialists disciplines like mathematics , physics , information theory , data science working together econometrists , sociologists , quantitative linguists , psychologists quarter century already dealing phenomena trying describe language exact science , model explain using methods tools earlier applied successfully natural systems . much already done much achieved , complexity social economic systems still far properly understood . every possible effort every meaningful contribution welcome bring us closer ultimate goal understanding complexity reference systems particular physical phenomenon general . also important approach problem different angles collecting many interdisciplinary works views one place like Special Issue human society eludes narrow-scope , single-discipline analysis . 1.1 . Money , Fiat Currencies , Cryptocurrencies Among variety emergent phenomena observe human society , one important money . appeared spontaneously independently many cultures , although used different material forms different regions , always served purpose : facilitate trade avoiding problem double coincidence needs restricts barter trading severely inherently . According economical models , status money acquired process spontaneous symmetry breaking commodity easily marketable , words , liquid one [ 4,5 ] . receiving status commodity , liquidity amplified kind self-propelling mechanism , everybody desires asset considered desirable others . However , another condition commodity used money : value expressed assets viewed stable . Sometimes happens current money loses value causes people withdraw using replace , stable asset . Thus , given asset status money may either durable temporary . important issue contemporary economy based fiat money intrinsic value unlike assets used play role money earlier history . Value fiat currencies depends crucially policies central banks , subject change . Moreover , central banks may increase money supply time , lead inflation rate increase . undermines confidence official currencies became ignition introduce cryptocurrencies decade ago . first cryptocurrency proposed 2008—Bitcoin ( BTC ) [ 6 ] . idea behind decouple currency institution government , preserving status universal means exchange , base trust currency solely technology supports . currency combine advantages cash electronic money : Anonymity use ( like cash ) capability transferred immediately place world ( like electronic money ) . already-existing technologies asymmetric cryptography distributed database ( new consensus mechanism— “ proof work ” ) linked decentralized secure register—blockchain [ 7 ] forms staple BTC . Unlike traditional currencies , Bitcoin inherently limited supply prevent loss value due inflation . Entropy 2020 , xx , 5 3 28 first widely recognized exchange enabling bitcoin exchanged traditional currencies , Mt . Gox , launched July 2010 followed first online ( black ) market—Silk Road . latter place one could anonymously buy anything pay bitcoins , first practical application cryptocurrency . significantly increased demand contributed first speculative bubble BTC [ 8 ] . subsequent crash occurred closing Silk Road suspending trade Mt . Gox October 2013 February 2014 . Bitcoin ’ recognition increased , use blockchain technology became popular turned also used trustful processing computer codes decentralized way . 2015 Ethereum distributed computing network launched [ 9 ] , allows one issue private tokens so-called Initial Coin Offer ( ICO ) raise capital simplified way various projects . ICO boom contributed next speculative bubble cryptocurrencies occurred 2017 ( ICO-mania [ 10 ] ) . time number issued cryptocurrencies doubled 700 1400 market capitalization reached 800 billion USD . crash January 2018 , BTC lost 80 % value cryptocurrencies lost even 99 % , may compared dot-com bubble crash 2000 ended euphoric phase investor attitude towards Internet-related companies . present market consolidated shows signatures maturity [ 11 ] . 1.2 . Basic Information Blockchain Technology order create electronic “ currency ” easily exchanged goods operated without central authority , time multiplied indefinitely like electronic files , required transactions involving “ currency ” registered publicly , ensures registry modified afterwards . Bitcoin network register consists sequence block files built one upon another ( blockchain ) containing information past transactions instances new Bitcoin unit creation . new network participant enter network directly via network client via external wallet must send information client ’ address specified Bitcoin sum owns . information distributed network nodes , return , new participant granted access complete information network node addresses many BTC units belong addresses . Thus , credibility system provided technology imposing certain set rules network participant must obey allowing network participants control . However , since Bitcoin blockchain public , one trace transaction history unit , theory might compromise transaction anonymity . transaction correctness guaranteed help asymmetric cryptography . Private keys sender receiver used encode decode transaction ( i.e. , send receive coins ) , public keys used public addresses allowing network identity verification . transaction visible network participant , nobody effectively alter re-encode know private keys involved parties . network , order function correctly , key implemented feature consensus mechanism ensures participants agree upon ownership cryptocurrency units many units total circulate . collecting information many transactions taking place Bitcoin network , consensus mechanism overcome problem information sources unreliable . done so-called proof-of-work ( PoW ) protocol used miners , i.e. , network nodes dedicated software collect transactions , verify correctness , integrate blocks . resource-consuming task miners got perform receiving new coins exchange sharing resources network . new Bitcoin unit generated majority miners agree upon correctness new block distributed network . block meet relevant criteria expressed specific form hash function considered valid one included Entropy 2020 , xx , 5 4 28 blockchain . miner decides include given block blockchain copy individually consensus settled kind game Nash equilibrium state . One believe majority miners agrees specific block ’ validity adds blockchain receive profit otherwise . Mining new Bitcoin unit requires much energy spent process demands optimization resources used discourage padding blocks fictitious information rejection probability block miners large . Therefore serves proof work participant made effort maintaining network , indeed . employed solution new block contains header previous one practically eliminates problem potential modifying past transactions—it viable economically since would require rebuilding entire chain . Bitcoin protocol designed way new blocks formed constant frequency , achieved adjusting amount corresponding calculations needed network ’ actual computing power . Moreover , reward forming new block halved every 210,000 blocks order approach quasi-asymptotically impassable limit 21 million Bitcoin units . Bitcoin protocol static undergoes constant modifications . reason protocol original design drawbacks challenge security lower comfort use . Among pivotal issues low performance ( network handle 5 transactions per second average , compared 1700 transactions per second Visa network ) , high operating costs equal amount electric energy consumed small industrialized countries ( like Ireland Denmark [ 12 ] ) , formidable computer facility . Moreover , one blockchain technology advantages—the inability making changes—may sometimes viewed disadvantage one considers protocol correcting since requires cloning entire network abandoning original blockchain . mechanism reducing transaction size allowing pack transactions single block ( called “ segregated witness ” , SegWit ) already implemented work another mechanism— “ Lightning Network ” —that allows micropayments outside main blockchain increasing bandwidth , currently underway . However , changes viewed inefficient many prefer building alternative networks scratch using certain features Bitcoin protocol , replacing better solutions . Thus , last decade , multitude different protocols proposed implemented , led introduction new cryptocurrencies . still exploit PoW protocol , popular alternative proof-of-stake ( PoS ) [ 13 ] . algorithm miners exist block validation process granted randomly chosen network nodes . Consistently , block formation rewarded new units rather validator nodes rewarded transaction fees . Fraud discouraged excluding fraudulent participants network securing , case , reward forming new block smaller possible loss already owned units . main advantage PoS efficiency : lack complicated long calculations , specialized user group needed confirm blocks everything done faster case PoW . various versions PoS protocol , like “ delegated proof stake ” ( DPoS ) based voting system engaging trustful delegated network nodes “ proof-of-authority ” ( PoA ) based granting reputation validator nodes instead cryptocurrency units abandoning decentralization paradigm . Main advantage protocols ( together hybrid versions ) scalability—more participants mean larger transaction capacity related network . 1.3 . Applications Blockchain Technology first Bitcoin alternative introduced 2011 managed survive today Litecoin ( LTC ) . Basically , Bitcoin ’ clone differs parent higher average Entropy 2020 , xx , 5 5 28 creation frequency ( 4 min ) higher prospected total number units ( 84 million ) well uses different hash function ( script instead dSHA-256 used Bitcoin ) . changes allowed LTC much smaller resource demand BTC made LTC computable standard CPUs . first cryptocurrency based Bitcoin ’ PoW protocol Ripple ( XRP ) [ 14 ] introduced 2012 . intended used method transferring money banks stock markets real time even outside national borders . August 2020 XRP third cryptocurrency terms capitalization . related cryptocurrency , Stellar ( XLM ) , also offers transactions financial institutions , unlike Ripple based proprietary code code open source . XRP XLM fixed supply limit , thus , subject inflation . separate group cryptocurrency protocols designed ensure user anonymity . corresponding cryptocurrencies called “ private coins ” : Dash ( DASH ) , Monero ( XMR ) , Zcash ( ZEC ) , many others . Dash uses two-layer network PoW miners first layer PoS “ masternodes ” second one . Monero , considered secure private coin often used criminal world [ 15 ] , provides anonymity thanks Ring Confidential Transactions ( RingCT ) public keys ( addresses ) hidden blockchain [ 16 ] . Zcash based solution allows one confirm information without disclose . Zcash allows perfect anonymity sender recipient well transaction size . Since anonymous addresses compatible public ones , transactions made public hidden wallets vice versa . DASH ZEC maximum supply set advance , XMR . Apart cryptocurrencies , another important category blockchain applications cryptocommodities ( together former called cryptoassets ) . automatically executed computer codes perform certain actions certain conditions met . Cryptocommodities enable payments using decentralized computing network . first cryptoasset Ethereum—an open-source computing platform designed programming decentralized applications smart contracts launched 2015 [ 9 ] . platform programming language cryptocurrency , Ethereum ( ETH ) , serves payment unit carrying computational operations platform . Ethereum based PoW consensus mechanism , uses another hash function ( Ethash ) supporting use GPUs mining process upper limit mining . Instead fixed block size , block requires specific number “ Gas ” units related computing power needed complete transactions contains . average block-completion frequency 15 maximum transaction number per second around 25 . Ethereum concept gained quickly high popularity among cryptocurrency community , currently , ETH second crytocurrency terms capitalization . success smart contracts ( i.e. , computer codes allowing automatic execution control transaction agreement actions ) possibility collecting funds Initial Coin Offers Ethereum platform , gave boost emergence similar platforms offering possibility creating applications decentralized environment . Major projects type include EOS Cardano ; cryptocurrencies allow collecting funds ICOs . Yet another group cryptoassets tokens , means payment decentralized applications built platforms like Ethereum contracts issued within ICOs development blockchain ventures . usually ’ blockchain . general , blockchain technology , thanks elimination need trust individual participants given system ensuring security , satisfactorily used wherever central intermediary connecting sellers buyers earns commissions ( example , Uber Airbnb ) . already introduced applications token form Augur ( platform enabling creation participation plants thematic range ) , Filecoin ( decentralized file storage system based PoW system rewards users sharing computer storage devices ) , IOTA ( project partially decentralized , open settlement platform needs so-called “ Internet things ” ) , Basic Attention Token ( project designed connect advertisers Entropy 2020 , xx , 5 6 28 content creators users rewards creators attracting users content provide ) . Finally , so-called “ stable coins ” —a combination token cryptocurrency assets—allow one relate value , conventional asset like US dollar ( e.g. , USDT , USDC , TUSD , PAX ) . 1.4 . Cryptocurrency Market Cryptocurrency trading possible , easily convertible traditional currencies like USD EUR cryptocurrencies . possibility provided 330 trading platforms ( August 2020 ) open 24 h day , seven days week . , together fact investors individuals , distinguishes cryptocurrency market Forex , trading takes place Monday Friday essentially OTC market mainly banks financial institutions participate . Another peculiarity cryptocurrency market reference exchange rate unlike Forex , reference rates provided Reuters . sole exception Bitcoin , whose exchange rate USD given futures quoted Chicago Mercantile Exchange [ 17 ] . Decentralization market means cryptocurrency pairs traded different platforms , which—if accompanied limited liquidity—can lead sizeable valuation differences platforms produce arbitrage opportunities , dual triangluar ones [ 11,18,19 ] . entire cryptocurrency market capitalization around 350 billion USD , close capitalization middle-size stock exchange also comparable capitalization largest American companies . 6500 different cryptocurrencies market right , gives total nearly 26,500 cryptocurrency pairs [ 20 ] . Founded 2017 , Binance [ 21 ] currently one largest cryptocurrency exchange terms volume . Binance offers trading approximately 650 cryptocurrency pairs including pairs cryptocurrency called binance ( BNB ) , used pay commissions exchange . spectacular development cryptocurrency market attracted much interest scientific community . first Bitcoin-related papers published already 2013–2015 [ 22,23 ] , real boom cryptocurrency-related publications occurred 2017 . Initially , bitcoin significant interest [ 24–26 ] , soon also cryptocurrencies went investigation [ 27–29 ] . appeared studies reporting correlations within market [ 30–38 ] , relationship regular markets [ 39–43 ] . Recently , researchers focused attention possible use BTC hedging instrument Forex [ 44 ] , gold commodities [ 45 ] , well stock markets [ 46,47 ] . also review papers devoted cryptocurrency markets : [ 11,48,49 ] . cryptocurrency market already gone long route mere curiosity playground technology enthusiasts , via emerging-market stage characterized relatively small capitalization , poor liquidity , large price fluctuations , short-term memory , frequent arbitrage opportunities , weak complexity , mature form characterized medium capitalization , improved liquidity , inverse-cubic power-law fluctuations [ 50,51 ] , long-term memory , sparse arbitrage opportunities , increasing complexity . interesting aspect cryptocurrency market route maturity : signatures complexity best quantified terms multifractal analysis . See Ref . [ 11 ] comprehensive study transition started 2012 ended essentially 2018 , viewed multifractality perspective . shall consider recent period 2019–2020 , comprises , among others , two significant events , i.e. , bull market April July 2019 Covid-19 pandemics ( March 2020 ) . Based high-frequency data covering large number cryptocurrency pairs principal traditional-market assets , investigate potential impact events cryptocurrency market structure relation traditional markets . Entropy 2020 , xx , 5 7 28 2 . Methods Results 2.1 . Data study collected high-frequency recordings X/BTC BTC/USDT exchange rates , X one 128 cryptocurrencies traded Binance platform [ 21 ] USDT related USD 1:1 peg [ 52 ] . exchange rates P ( ) sampled every 1 min . calculated normalized logarithmic returns r∆t defined r∆t = ( R∆t − µR ) /σR , R∆t ( ) = log ( P ( t+ ∆t ) ) − log ( P ( ) ) , ( 1 ) µR σR mean standard deviation R∆t ( ) , respectively , ∆t sampling interval . also collected 1-min quotes several conventional assets expressed US dollar—13 currencies : AUD , EUR , GBP , NZD , CAD , CHF , CNH , JPY , MXN , NOK , PLN , TRY , ZAR , three stock market indices : Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJI ) , Nasdaq100 , & P500 , four commodities : XAU ( gold ) , CL ( crude oil ) , XAG ( silver ) , HG ( copper ) . come Dukascopy platform [ 53 ] , BTC/USD ETH/USD exchange rates . quotes also transformed time series returns . 2.2 . Multifractal Formalism Multifractal analysis one promising methods studying empirical data representing natural social systems able quantify complexity systems express relatively simple way small set associated quantities . already applied many works univariate multivariate data sets number different systems : Physics [ 54 ] , biology [ 55 ] , chemistry [ 56 ] , geophysics [ 57 ] , hydrology [ 58 ] , atmospheric physics [ 59 ] , quantitative linguistics [ 60 ] , behavioral sciences [ 61 ] , cognitive structures [ 62 ] , music [ 63 ] , songbird rhythms [ 64 ] , physiology [ 65 ] , human behaviour [ 66 ] , social psychology [ 67 ] even ecological sciences [ 68 ] , especially financial markets [ 69–77 ] . Let us consider two time series length : xi , yi , = 1 , ... , ( large enough overcome statistical uncertainties ) . Signal profiles created time series integrating subtracting mean : X ( j ) = j ∑ i=1 [ xi − 〈x〉 ] , ( j ) = j ∑ i=1 [ yi − 〈y〉 ] . ( 2 ) signal profiles divided segments ν length s. may separate partially overlapping ; separate , number Ms = bT/sc . local trend removed segment fitting data polynomials P ( ) X , ν , P ( ) , ν degree ( typically , = 2 [ 78–80 ] ) . covariance F2xy determined residual signals segment [ 81,82 ] : F2xy ( ν , ) = 1 ∑ k=1 { [ X ( ( ν− 1 ) s+ k ) − P ( ) X , ν ( k ) ] [ ( ( ν− 1 ) s+ k ) − P ( ) , ν ( k ) ] } ( 3 ) used calculate q-th order fluctuation function [ 83 ] : Fqxy ( ) = 1 Ms Ms ∑ ν=1 sign ( F2xy ( ν , ) ) |F2xy ( ν , ) |q/2 , ( 4 ) sign ( F2xy ( ν , ) ) means sign function . F2xy ( ν , ) considered value random variable , parameter q resembles exponent specifying order moment : large positive values Entropy 2020 , xx , 5 8 28 favour segments characterized large variance increasing relative magnitude respect small-variance segments , negative values q opposite . Thus , applying different values q , one construct effective filters select segments certain variance range . fluctuation function ( 4 ) calculated different segment lengths s. Fqxy ( ) power-law form , i.e. , Fqxy ( ) 1/q = Fxy ( q , ) ∼ sλ ( q ) , ( 5 ) q 6= 0 , original time series xi yi fractally cross-correlated . λ ( q ) = const , monofractal cross-correlation , otherwise multifractal one . special case xi ≡ yi ( one signal ) . case F ( q , ) = [ 1 Ms Ms ∑ ν=1 [ F2 ( ν , ) ] q 2 ] 1 q ( 6 ) fractal case corresponds F ( q , ) ∼ sh ( q ) , ( 7 ) h ( q ) generalized Hurst exponent . h ( q ) = const signal monofractal , otherwise multifractal [ 80 ] . useful measure fractal properties singularity spectrum f ( α ) defined α = h ( q ) + qh′ ( q ) , f ( α ) = q [ α− h ( q ) ] + 1 , ( 8 ) α Hölder exponent . f ( α ) interpreted fractal dimension singularities characterized given α . monofractal case consists single point , multifractal case shape inverted parabola asymmetric concave function . Width f ( α ) interpreted measure signal ’ complexity , wider , singularity types identified signal . width depends range q quantified ∆α = αmax − αmin , ( 9 ) αmin = α ( qmax ) αmax = α ( qmin ) minimum maximum value α calculated different values q . Another important feature f ( α ) left-right asymmetry [ 84 ] . left-hand-side asymmetry corresponds diverse multifractality ( stronger correlations ) large amplitude level , right-hand-side asymmetry indicates signal parts small amplitude dominant source multifractality . Fqxy ( ) denotes qth-order detrended covariance , one define qth-order detrended correlation coefficient [ 85,86 ] : ρ ( q , ) = Fqxy ( ) √ Fqxx ( ) F q yy ( ) , ( 10 ) analogy qth-order Pearson correlation coefficient . Fxx Fyy calculated Equation ( 6 ) . coefficient ρ ( q , ) assume values range [ −1 , 1 ] provided q > 0 . q ≤ 0 situation becomes complicated ρ ( q , ) may fall outside range , requires delicate interpretation [ 85 ] . Therefore , many studies ρ ( q , ) used carried restriction q > 0 . coefficient ρ ( q , ) describes detrended cross-correlations two signals different scales amplifying data points within given amplitude range . filtering ability ρ ( q , ) advantage standard correlation measures , cross-correlation strength among empirical time series size-dependent [ 87 ] . coefficient ρ ( q , ) may used two signals without requirement fractal .
