However , places , services amenities individuals visit city exhibitdifferent levels experienced segregation , locations mix different socio-economic groupswhile others ( Athey et al . 2021 ; Moro et al . 2021 ) .In study characterize urban locations foster socio-economic mixing lower ex-perienced segregation attracting people diverse strata . , emphasize two aspectsof urban locations influence observed socio-economic mixing : amenity portfolio andgeographical centrality city.The type amenities available location determine purpose function there-fore related experienced segregation . Noyman et al . ( 2019 ) illustrates individual GPStrajectories urban locations offering entertainment amenities , services natural water fea-tures visited diverse set people . Athey et al . ( 2021 ) describes individualscan experience relatively low experienced segregation outdoor places like parks , sports fieldsand playgrounds , commercial establishments restaurants , bars retail stores . Theyfind places entertainment , like theaters accommodations , like hotels least seg-regated urban locations . Moro et al . ( 2021 ) shows category places strong predictorfor experienced income segregation unique places cities , arts venues , museums orairports tend highly integrative , places primarily serve local communities , asgrocery stores places worship generally segregated income . Yet , urban locationscan hardly described single amenity types ; instead , typically host types ameni-ties . Despite previous empirical efforts , systematic examination mixture amenitiesat specific urban locations contribute social mixing still missing literature.Specialized amenities serve specific needs wider public therefore attractpeople diverse neighborhoods tend situate center cities . central place theoryoriginally developed inter-urban scale Christaller ( 1933 ) Lösch ( 1954 ) explains thehierarchy cities towns size range functions provide andhas used study functions locations within cities ( see example ( Wang 2021 ) ) .Higher-order centers attract population larger area , share thefunctions lower order centers , also host specialized functions . Building onthe central place theory , Zhong et al . ( 2017 ) combines density , number people attracted tolocations diversity , range activities engage locations singlecentrality measure identify urban centers Singapore illustrate evolution time.2Noyman et al . ( 2019 ) shows urban locations higher centrality urban road networksattract diverse visitors . contrary , Moro et al . ( 2021 ) presents urban locations withhigher average travel distance tend less segregated locations highlyaccessible . studies highlight accessible , central locations attract diversevisitors , yet , nature available amenity mix might related position locations , focused far.Here , aim extend literature investigating amenity mix cen-tral position urban locations related experienced segregation , put differently , themixing people diverse socio-economic strata . new contribution application ofthe economic complexity framework urban amenities ( Hidalgo 2021 ) quantify ability oflocations – level neighborhoods amenities well – attracting visitors diversesocio-economic status across city.The concept economic complexity originally developed Hidalgo Hausmann ( 2009 ) defined complexity economies diversity non-ubiquitous products ser-vices . Economic complexity indicative countries economic growth , income level , emissionsand inequalities ( Hidalgo 2021 ) . , concept applied different data sources suchas patents , occupations scientific publications diverse spatial scales countries tocities ( Balland et al . 2022 ; Magalhães et al . 2023 ) . adopt measurement technique touncover complexity neighborhoods amenities . propose neighborhood acomplex amenity mix case offers diverse set amenities types barely presentat locations . contrary , complex amenities neighborhoods arespecialized co-located similarly non-ubiquitous amenities . Unlike origi-nal framework economic complexity captures knowledge capabilities required toachieve economic outputs ( Hidalgo Hausmann 2009 ) , approach address pro-ductive operative knowledge given location accumulated ( Hidalgo 2021 ) . Instead , measure sophistication local amenity supply serve diverse demand attractdiverse socio-economic groups.The rational apply neighborhood amenity complexity understand mixing peopleis based two reasons . First , diverse amenity mixes neighborhoods attract people di-verse demands . Second , locations non-ubiquitous amenities attract people diverseneighborhoods , particular service hard find elsewhere . Consequently , complex ameni-ties also expected attract diverse visitors . Therefore , hypothesis diverse mix ofnon-ubiquitous amenities create inclusive , multipurpose neighborhood likelyto attractive wide-variety people . contribution amenity mix socio-economic diversity visitors urban locations rarely unveiled , diverse amenities areargued concentrate attract people central places cities ( Zhong et al . 2017 ) . betterunderstand connection neighborhood amenity complexity , urban centrality andsocio-economic mixing , test correlation socio-economic diversity visitors.We test argument Budapest , capital Hungary combining point interests ( POI ) 3data collected Google Places API individual mobility trajectories collected GPSaggregator company .

Moreover , contribute lineof research segregation patterns inside cities illustrating direct fashion based fine-grained mobility data centrality urban locations largely influence socio-economic mixing.Our empirical work several limitations , offers promising future research directions.17The study focuses city Budapest . Budapest large city Hungary itclearly monocentric structure . Therefore , findings limited specific context andsimilar empirical works cities different size , geography urban structure necessaryto assess generality conclusions.Mobility data empirical analysis produced monthly basis . findings arevalid 16 24 months available COVID-19 clearly affect relationship be-tween amenity complexity diversity visitors urban locations . However , datadoes contain enough observations provide significant results 24 months understudy . Confirming results better mobility data important future research direction.To construct amenity complexity measures , rely specific neighborhood struc-ture Budapest , however , alternative spatial scales different urban settings necessary betested future . believe level neighborhoods appropriate spatial scale toconstruct amenity complexity metrics two reasons . First , size applied spatial unitscan influence nestedness location-amenity matrix used construct complexity metrics.Co-occurrence POIs different amenity categories less likely case consider smallergeographical areas . Neighborhoods proved large enough produce intuitive results.Second , neighborhoods important spatial units urban life . argued theenvironment influence social capital accumulation social mobility ( Chetty et al . 2022 ; Chetty , Hendren , Katz 2016 ) . Moreover , clear administrative boarders peo-ple identify , makes interpretation amenity complexity results moreappealing.The counting POIs within neighborhoods allow differentiation ca-pacity quality amenities . tested unsuccessfully number visitors amenitycategories within neighborhoods input rather sheer number POIs . fu-ture , similar sophisticated data would needed measure amenity complexity moreaccurately.In empirical exercise , adopted commonly used economic complexity indicatorto amenities neighborhoods .
