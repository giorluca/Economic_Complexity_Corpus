IntroductionThe notion productive structure structural transformation aneconomy play important roles processes economic growth development canbe traced back original contributions economists including Rosenstein-Rodan [ 1 ] , Prebisch [ 2 ] Singer [ 3 ] . However , conceptual data limitations substantiallyconstrained empirical research attempts accurately identify associationbetween productive structure economic growth . Predominantly , research beencharacterised either use broad indicators structural transformation , aschanging shares manufacturing economic activity [ 4,5 ] , aggregate indicators ofdegrees economic industrial activity diversified [ 6–8 ] .With introduction concept economic complexity [ 9,10 ] , researchstrand received important impetus . Economic complexity , relating degreeof sophistication country ’ productive structure , affected multitude factorsthat related economic growth , including factor endowments , geography , institutions , social capital country ’ historical trajectory [ 11 ] . line interpretation , itis likely countries higher level economic complexity characterised byhigher growth increases economic complexity exercise positive effect oneconomic growth rates . confirmed large number cross-country studies thatidentify positive effects country ’ level sophistication export baskets degreeof economic complexity economic growth [ 9,10,12,13 ] .Sustainability 2021 , 13 , 1006. https : //doi.org/10.3390/su13021006 https : //www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2021 , 13 , 1006 2 23More recently , research effects economic complexity broadenedby examining whether country ’ productive structure also matters distributionof income . increasingly understood , similarly processes economic growth , income distribution country affected number underlying factors , manyof related , directly captured , concept economic complexity.For instance , degree sophistication country ’ product mix reflects level ofknowledge embodied country ’ population , well availability amplejob opportunities [ 11,14 ] . Furthermore , quality inclusiveness institutions likelyto co-evolve level economic complexity economy . suggests thatcountries high degree economic complexity characterised lower levelsof income inequality , evidenced instance cross-country studies Hartmannet al . [ 15 ] Lee Vu [ 16 ] .However , may also case economic complexity , especially countriesthat operating earlier stages economic development , associated higherincome inequality . Processes structural transformation involve moving lowto higher value-added activities often characterised increasing levels capitalintensity introduction increasing reliance new technologies . willfavour relative returns high-skilled workers economy , resulting increasein income inequality [ 17 ] . Given relationship economic complexity andincome distribution difficult predict priori open multiple interpretations , research needed order improve understanding exact nature thisrelationship.In paper extend upon emerging research strand conducting novelempirical analysis obtain evidence potential significance relationshipbetween economic complexity income distribution well nature thisrelationship . contribution paper three-fold . First , instead using cross-country framework , focus impact economic complexity income inequalitywithin individual country . increasingly understood drivers economicgrowth , institutions knowledge spillovers caused agglomeration firms , workers innovation , well inter-firm linkages multinational corporationsand domestic firms , differ substantially across regions within countries [ 18–21 ] . Thisnot suggests economic complexity likely subject substantial variationat regional level within country , also analysis relationship betweeneconomic complexity income inequality regional level particularlyinformative.Second , inspired original contribution Kuznets [ 22 ] nature therelationship income level country distribution income , weexamine whether relationship economic complexity income inequalityis characterised non-linearity . Kuznets [ 22 ] proposed relationship betweenthe income country income inequality follows inverted U-shape , whereby , following initial phase increasing income accompanied growing inequality , increases income generate equal income distribution . relationshipbetween economic complexity income inequality may similar shape . countrywith low level economic complexity may experience increase income inequalitywhen production sophisticated products disproportionally benefits high-skilled workers . level economic complexity , forces inclusiveinstitutions , rising job opportunities stronger worker representation may becomemore important , resulting effect economic complexity income inequalitybecoming negative.Third , conduct analysis Brazil , country characterised high levelsof poverty inequality . Brazil seen representative substantial numberof countries world economy , whilst according average income beclassified lower-middle upper-middle income countries , still facing relativelyhigh levels poverty income inequality . Furthermore , countries oftenSustainability 2021 , 13 , 1006 3 23characterised marked regional differences terms income inequality , furthersupporting focus analysing relationship economic complexity andincome inequality regional level . way , findings Brazil may also berelevant wider group countries find similar situation.The paper constructed follows .

Finally , section six summarises concludes.2 . Literature ReviewFollowing initial focus impact productive structure country oneconomic growth , introduction economic complexity index ( ECI ) Hidalgo andHausman [ 9 ] recently fostered research effect ECI income inequal-ity [ 14–17,23 ] . Economic complexity seen “ high-resolution expression ” ( [ 15 ] , p. 85 ) number underlying factors , including institutions , human capital , avail-ability job opportunities worker representation . suggests countries witha higher level economic complexity characterised lower level incomeinequality , resulting better institutions , job opportunities , among improve-ments . However , findings small number available studies mixed , withsome studies finding negative association studies reporting positive effect.Hartmann et al . [ 15 ] first estimate impact ECI incomedistribution . Using data 150 countries period 1963–2008 , test alinear relationship find economic complexity negative predictor incomeinequality . findings also show , controlling economic complexity , therising part Kuznets curve-like relationship GDP income inequalitybecomes pronounced . Furthermore , examine effect Product Gini Index ( PGI ) , linking product categories different levels income inequality . findingsshow products associated highest levels income inequality ( i.e. , high PGIscore ) consist mainly commodities ( e.g. , cocoa beans animal hair ) , lowlevel economic complexity . contrast , low PGI products include sophisticatedforms machinery manufacturing products ( e.g. , textiles , machinery road rollers ) , involving high level economic complexity . Using framework , Hartmannet al . [ 11 ] look structural constrains income inequality Latin America , bycomparing productive sophistication structural constraints income inequalityof Latin American Caribbean countries China high-performingAsian economies . results show Latin American Caribbean countries continueto export products associated high levels inequality low levels economiccomplexity , productive structure strongly constrains ability generate anddistribute income . intuition behind findings complex products require alarger network skilled workers , related industries , inclusive institutions economiccompetitiveness . characteristics conducive equal societies . contrast , thecompetitiveness simple industrial products resource-exploiting activities mainlybased resource richness , low labour costs , routinised activities economies scale , characteristics foster unequal economies.In contrast , studies present evidence indicates economic complexityfosters income inequality . likely economic complexity co-evolves higherSustainability 2021 , 13 , 1006 4 23levels value added , productivity , use modern technologies , etc . cases , maybe rising levels economic complexity generate larger wage differentials lowand high-skilled workers , resulting increased income inequality . example studythat presents evidence positive effect Lee Vu [ 16 ] . estimate effect ofthe productive structure using system-GMM ( Generalised Method Moments ) dynamicpanel 113 countries 5-year averages period 1965–2014 find positiverelationship ECI income inequality . Similarly , Chu Hoang [ 17 ] carry outa system-GMM estimation covering 88 countries period 2002–2007 find thateconomic complexity associated higher income inequality . Lee Wang [ 23 ] alsoreport positive impact economic complexity income inequality , based use ofa finite mixture model 43 countries period 1991–2016.In extension findings , studies provide evidence suggests therelationship ECI income inequality may characterised non-linearity.Kuznets [ 22 ] argued likely relationship level income andincome inequality inverted U-shape . early levels economic development , thebeneficial effects economic growth likely materialise amongst sub-groups ofa country ’ population , generating increased income inequality . ongoing increasesin economic development people start participate benefitfrom growing economy , resulting negative effect income inequality . similarprocess may apply effect economic complexity income distribution . Startingat low levels economic complexity , increases complexity may benefit capital ownersand high-skilled workers particular , resulting worsening income distribution.With ongoing increases economic complexity , components economic complexity ( e.g. , institutions , worker representation , job opportunities ) may become relatively moreimportant , would change effect economic complexity income inequalityfrom positive negative stage.Hausmann et al . [ 10 ] present findings suggest non-linear relationshipmay important . look opportunity value , rewards knowledge accumula-tion , relates economic complexity . data reveal countries lowECI low rewards knowledge ; countries low ECI unableto effectively put knowledge productive use . However , countries high levels ofproductive knowledge also low rewards knowledge . countries , productiveknowledge already occupies large fraction product space , limiting returns fromfurther knowledge accumulation . Countries intermediate level complexity varymuch widely opportunity value . associate opportunity value wagelevels , findings imply relationship ECI wage differentials ischaracterised non-linearity . Le et al . [ 24 ] also provide evidence . use datafor 90 countries period 2002–2014 estimate effect export diversificationon income inequality find evidence inverted U-shape relationship . Althougheconomic complexity comprehensive indicator country ’ productive structurethan level export diversification , findings taken support notionthat effect economic complexity income inequality non-linear.Summing , small body evidence indicates economic complexity playsan important role driver income inequality . However , evidence mixed , withdifferent studies reporting negative positive effects , indicating research isurgently required . Considering multitude factors encapsulated theconcept economic complexity , possibility relationship economiccomplexity income distribution non-linear character particularly interestingto examine empirically . precisely , whereas early increases economiccomplexity foster increase income inequality , ongoing increases economiccomplexity may start generate negative impact income inequality.Sustainability 2021 , 13 , 1006 5 233 .

Industry Occupation DiversitySo far , findings clearly confirm economic complexity important driver ofinequality Brazilian states . However , may ECI captures part theeffect productive structure regions . ECI measured internationalexport data , taking account international comparative advantages . means thatindustries produce domestic market captured economic complexity.While national-level data seems like reasonable assumption , using data fora set regions within country may less so.One reason complexity productive structure may fully capturedby ECI using regional data region may involved production ofcomplex products domestic market , whilst producing less complex products forinternational markets . Second , well known economic activity tends spatiallyconcentrate within countries benefit agglomeration economies [ 37,38 ] . isalso case Brazil , exporting activities concentrated limited number ofregions [ 32 ] . states may incorporate complex intermediate products supplyto exporting states . ECI based international export data , assigncomplexity states export products , without taking account part ofthe complexity states linked complexity economic activity statesthat provide intermediate products.In attempt widen measurement productive structure economicactivities Brazilian states , use two additional variables . One variable , labelledCNAE diversity ( follows Brazilian National Classification Economic Activities ) , captures level industry diversity state , measured number industries inthe states . second variable , labelled CBO diversity ( named line BrazilianOccupational Classification ) , measured number occupations state . Inorder facilitate incorporation regression model , z-transform thesevariables.To obtain impression nature relationship diversity vari-ables income inequality , create scatterplots state averaged Gini CNAEDiversity CBO Diversity , shown Figure 4 . scatterplots show negativeassociation industry diversity state level inequality , suggesting thisdimension regional productive structure may also generate impact inequality.Sustainability 2021 , 13 , 1006 16 23Sustainability 2021 , 13 , x PEER REVIEW 16 22 ( ) ( b ) Figure 4.

Summary ConclusionsWith introduction concept economic complexity , research strandinvestigating impact productive structures structural transformation eco-Sustainability 2021 , 13 , 1006 19 23nomic growth received important impetus . particular , growing evidencethat countries involved production export complex products arecharacterised higher average growth rates increases economic complexitylead faster economic growth.Most recently , research strand started widen scope investigating theimpact economic complexity income distribution within countries . Economiccomplexity linked multitude factors including factor endowments , knowledge , availability job opportunities quality institutions . suggests thatmore complex productive structures exercise positive effects distribution ofincome , generating hypothesis economic complexity negatively associated withincome inequality . Given small number studies look relationship theheterogeneity available evidence , research relationship urgentlyrequired.The purpose paper contribute extend upon emerging researchstrand , adding literature following three ways . First , contrast existingstudies look relationship economic complexity income inequalityin cross-country frameworks , study investigates regional level Brazil . Ourfocus regional dimension linked notion many factors aredirectly connected economic complexity subject substantial heterogeneity acrossregions , warranting empirical research impact regional productive structures onthe income distribution regions.Second , line concept Kuznets curve , examine whether therelationship economic complexity income inequality characterised bynon-linearity . Initial increases economic complexity may disproportionally benefit high-skilled workers , generating increased inequality . ongoing increases economiccomplexity , components productive structures lower inequality may becomemore important , resulting negative impact income inequality higher levels ofcomplexity.Third , Brazil country that—whilst level economic development thatclassifies lower- upper-middle income—is facing high levels poverty andinequality . , representative substantial group countries worldeconomy find similar situation whose governments searchingfor ways implement policies promote economic development whilst also impactinglevels poverty inequality.Using panel data 27 federative units period 2002–2014 , obtain evidencein support notion relationship economic complexity incomeinequality inverted U-shape . Controlling number drivers income inequal-ity , pooled OLS estimations show significant negative effect economic complexityand significant positive effect squared term two different measures incomeinequality . extension , given low variability main variables years , werely random effects estimations capture time-invariant effects . estimator , although statistical significance estimated effects economic complexity isaffected specifications , nature estimated effect two economiccomplexity variables remains , support inverted U-shaped natureof relationship . factors play important role drivers income inequalityin Brazilian states include GDP per capita , human capital regional importance ofthe informal sector.Next , findings show effect economic complexity income distributionis affected level development regions . estimating regressionmodels separately regions low high levels urbanisation GDP per capita , thenon-linear relationship economic complexity income inequality materialises inthose regions characterised relatively high levels two indicators . explanationfor finding certain level development needs reached regionalproductive structure starts exercise meaningful effects income inequality.Sustainability 2021 , 13 , 1006 20 23The indicator economic complexity based international exports regionsbased revealed comparative advantage . pose problem using regionaldata , indicator capture inter-regional trade within country . may thatregions supply ( complex ) intermediate inputs regions turn export productsto international markets . test whether characteristics regional productivestructures important , augment regression models two variables capturethe level regional industry occupation2 diversity . findings indicate thesefeatures regional productive structures important , are—independently fromeconomic complexity—significantly impacting income inequality . Separate estimationsfor regions relatively low high level development show , whereas economiccomplexity important driver income inequality developed states , industry occupation diversity important states lower level development.In conclusion , findings Brazil confirm economic complexity im-portant impact income distribution . inverted U-shape relationship betweeneconomic complexity income inequality indicates governments use poli-cymaking promote economic development economic complexity , increasinglycomplex productive structures lead beneficial effects income distribution . Ofcourse , research needed obtain evidence relationship theconditions affect impact economic complexity income distributions.In extension , believe research benefit incorporating theregional dimension impact economic complexity , given productive struc-tures determinants subject substantial variation across regions withincountries . research also benefit considering wider interpretation theconcept productive structures beyond levels economic complexity . Indicators ofeconomic complexity based levels international trade according revealedcomparative advantages . conducting regional analysis , indicators notcapture economic complexity regions less involved international trade butsupply intermediate products regions trade intensive . work istherefore needed design indicators economic complexity incorporate relativeimportance indirect exports regions improve identification theimpact regional productive structures income inequality subnational level.Author Contributions : Conceptualisation : M.B.M. , J.S . ; methodology : M.B.M. , J.S. , J.A.J. , formal anal-ysis : M.B.M. , J.S. , J.A.J . ; writing—original draft preparation : M.B.M. , J.S. , J.A.J . ; project administrationM.B.M . authors read agreed published version manuscript.Funding : research received external funding.Institutional Review Board Statement : applicable.Informed Consent Statement : applicable.Data Availability Statement : Publicly available datasets analysed study . data canbe found following links : http : //legacy.dataviva.info/en/ http : //www.ipeadata.gov.br/Default.aspx.Conflicts Interest : authors declare conflict interest.Sustainability 2021 , 13 , 1006 21 23Appendix ASustainability 2021 , 13 , x PEER REVIEW 20 22 Appendix Figure A1.
