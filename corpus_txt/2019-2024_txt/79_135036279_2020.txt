Struffolino , M. Raitano 1 31 IntroductionIn recent decades , many European countries sought increase labour market flexi-bilization removing labour market rigidities ( e.g . centralized bargaining hiring firing costs [ OECD 1994 ] ) . ultimate aim reduce unemployment fos-ter smoother transitions employment young people workers weak labour market attachment , typically women low-skilled individuals . However , cases , reform process strongly emphasized flexibilization margins—i.e . deregulation hiring temporary atypical arrangements—thus creating two-tier labour mar-kets flexible permanent contracts coexist ( Boeri 2011 ) .Although newly introduced non-standard arrangements expected facilitate labour market entry workers would subsequently follow linear upward trajectories towards stable standard contracts , authors argued deregulation might generated unstable , complex , ultimately uncertain employment life courses ( e.g . Hofmeister et al . 2006 ; Mills et al . 2006 ) .The literature economics sociology investigates short-term effects labour market deregulation exploring ‘ trap versus stepping stone effect ’ non-standard labour market arrangements ( e.g . Barbieri et al . 2016 ; Booth et al . 2002 ; Gagliarducci 2005 ; Polavieja 2005 ) . proceeds primarily considering occurrence timing transitions single events , i.e . temporary permanent contracts . politi-cal science literature labour market dualization emphasizes process workforce segmentation insiders outsiders , leads increasing institutional dual-ism policies ( e.g . employment protection unemployment benefits ) allocate dif-ferent rights entitlements different categories recipients ( Davidsson Nac-zyk 2009 ; Emmenegger et al . 2012 ; Rueda 2014 ) . Dualization measured adopting either categorical continuous indicator ‘ outsiderness ’ ( i.e . risk atypi-cal employment unemployment ; Schwander Häusermann 2013 ) always refers ‘ point-in-time outcomes ’ using cross-sectional analytical designs . streams litera-ture demonstrated ‘ trap effect ’ non-standard employment arrangements insider–outsider cleavages exist extend generational inequalities depending welfare state . especially case conservative welfare states Mediter-ranean variety ( Chauvel Schröder 2014 ; Palier Thelen 2010 ) .We extend previous literatures two respects . First , describe trend observed across cohorts , namely longitudinal variability early-career trajectories . use indicator accounts temporal dynamics explore—even causal fashion—the association changes institutional setting entire early-career trajectory conceptualized ‘ process outcome ’ ( Abbott 2016 ) . means working trajectories global result multiple single events ( e.g . complete succession different jobs within career ) . utilize sequence analysis calculate complexity early-stage careers using synthetic indicator account length episodes employment well mobility spells employment . therefore adequately reflects life course concept working-life differentiation : greater number states episodes experienced time , higher differentiation ( Brückner Mayer 2005 ) . Stability usu-ally defined opposition frequent mobility different jobs , contracts , arrangements , whereas mobility often refers frequent transitions , employ-ment unemployment vice versa , well different contractual arrange-ments . workers move permanent temporary contracts , experience Early‑Career Complexity Labour‑Market…1 3downward transitions . Hence mobility patterns might generate employment trajectories linear upwardly sloped , i.e . imply progression toward desirable positions . Stability linearity especially relevant workers early stages careers : different levels exposure highly volatile trajectories point might long-lasting consequences ( ) individual ’ working life ( Kohli 2007 ) . Ultimately , early-career differentiation highly deregulated con-text may expose outsiders high precariousness , conceptualized ‘ employment uncertain , unpredictable , risky point view worker ’ ( Kalleberg 2009 : 2 ) .Second , consider trends across cohorts early-career complexity differ work-er ’ gender socio-economic status ( education parental background ) . background increasing deregulation , individualization risk perspective suggests increase employment uncertainty affect individuals equally ( Beck 1992 ; Sennett 1999 ) lead generalization unpredictable precarious careers . contrast , persistent inequality perspective argues inequality patterns based traditional stratification factors continue shape individuals ’ exposure labour market risks ( Breen 1997 ; Goldthorpe 2002 ) . Specifically , assumes ongoing pro-cess recommodification risk linked labour market deregulation affects workers exposed market fluctuations fewer background resources rely . workers typically new entrants labour market , especially women and/or low socio-economic status groups.We focus Italy , flexibilization reforms mid-1990s/mid-2000s deregulated non-standard arrangements . Although employment rates increased , caused massive growth temporary atypical contracts , employment protection limited ( Boeri 2011 ) . Italian economic model traditionally characterized high rates youth unemployment , low rates female participation , sizable proportion ( low-skilled ) individuals working informal economy . reforms ‘ margins ’ ( less directly ) targeted new entrants , engendered age cohort gaps access protected labour market segment . result , contexts characterized Mediterranean welfare state , differences pro-tected/unprotected older/younger workers overlapped traditional distinction outsiders insiders ( Barbieri Scherer 2009 ; Chauvel Schröder 2014 ; Palier Thelen 2010 ; Rueda 2014 ) . backdrop , considering longitudi-nal variability differentiation early career trajectories young workers entering labour market across cohorts gender education offers insights actual consequences insiders/outsiders cleavage terms precariousness . fact , Italy represents important case study comparative social policy worth studying depth per se least two reasons . First , process reforms towards progressive flexibili-zation lead peculiar two-tier segmentation several implications inequality opportunity inequality outcomes ( Boeri 2011 ; Esping-Andersen Regini 2000 ; Henrichs Jessoula 2012 ) . Second , international economic literature focused prominently wage profiles entry phase ( , episodes non-zero-wages ) careers , showing Italy outlier international comparisons wage experience patterns across cohorts mostly declined recent decades high-skilled workers ( Beaudry Green 2000 ; Fitzenberger et al . 2001 ; Mishel 2012 ; Naticchioni et al . 2016 ; Rosolia Torrini 2016 ) . However , thorough account cohort dynamics early-career patterns incorporate ( multiple ) transitions unemployment employment states better characterize Italian case still missing existing scholarship . E. Struffolino , M. Raitano 1 3We use innovative longitudinal dataset built combining survey data adminis-trative information working histories . analyse 7-year-long early careers , starting first employment episode across six cohorts young Italian workers entered labour market 1974 2001 . means compare complexity early-career trajectories across cohorts workers exposed increasing degrees labour market deregulation . looking single country , adopt ‘ differential ’ life course sociology perspective studies country cases time highlight linkages institutional configurations life course outcomes instead comparing broad categories welfare state regimes ( Mayer 2005 ) .2 Italian Institutional BackgroundFrom mid-1980s early 2000s , Italian government approved several labour market reforms ease constraints temporary hiring introduce new contractual arrangements . Italy , Mediterranean countries , deregulation promoted way ( ideally ) boosting participation vulnerable workers , women , workers age 50 , low-skilled individuals , young people , immigrants ( Vesan 2009 ) . reforms fostered deregulation process ‘ partial selective ’ ( Esp-ing-Andersen Regini 2000 ) targeted ‘ margins ’ labour market sys-tem , , non-standard employment . Unlike European countries , access protected labour market segments uneven based skills differentials ( Giesecke Groß 2003 ) , Italy severe cleavage existed older younger cohorts workers ( Barbieri 2009 ) . Older workers remained core segment , new entrants found difficult move periphery ( e.g . Barbieri et al . 2016 ) .1Table 1 shows timeline reforms connects cohorts workers whose early careers affected . article , focus individuals entered labour market period 1974 2001 follow 7-year-long obser-vational window starting first work episode . Therefore , empirical analyses concern workers whose early careers unfolded 2008 economic crisis.In mid-1980s , number regulations introduced increase part-time employment , raise maximum age apprenticeships , facilitate job training ( e.g . internships ) , well allow reintegration long-term unemployed work-ers . first set reforms affected early careers individuals entered labour market late 1970s . Subsequent reforms extend apprenticeship training contracts broader range sectors , took place early 1990s , affected workers entered late 1980s . Following , specific public pension fund introduced 1995 ( Gestione Separata , implemented 1996 ) para-sub-ordinate workers—also termed dependent self-employed workers . individuals self-employed legal terms , work risk formally subordi-nate employer , often ‘ economically dependent ’ employer cases , activity relies upon one extremely small number clients ( Raitano 2018 ) . phase , deregulation reached crucial turning point : creation fund institutionalized para-subordinate collaboration contracts ( hiring 1 reduction unfair dismissal protection offered standard contracts introduced much later , 2012 2015 , whereas deregulation fixed-term contracts occurred 2014.Early‑Career Complexity Labour‑Market…1 3Table 1 Summary labour market reforms identification entry cohorts affected new regulationsYear reformReformsEntry cohort inter-ested first year labour marketEntry cohort interested along first 7 years labour market1983–1984Regulation extension part-time , apprenticeship , training contracts1983–20011977–20011994Extension apprenticeship training contracts1994–20011988–20011995Introduction 1996 public pension fund Gestione Separata para-subordinate workers , thus institutionalizing collaboration contracts ( hiring-firing costs ) 1996–20011990–20011997Pacchetto Treu Law 186/1997 : introduction temporary worker agencies relaxation con-straints hiring fixed-term employees1997–20011991–20012001Law 368/2001 : removal constraints hiring fixed-term employees20011995–20012003Legge Biagi Law 30/2003 : extension temporary worker agencies introduction new types atypical contracts ( ‘ project collaborations ’ , ‘ job call ’ , ‘ staff leasing ’ , ‘ job sharing ’ ) .1997–2001 E.

Raitano 1 3firing costs , low social security guarantees , reduced pension contribution rates applied recent reforms ) . consequence , firms started using con-tracts large scale instead standard employment arrangements . reform , workers ( mostly freelance researchers ) hired para-subordinate con-tracts . According INPS ( Italian National Social Security Institute ) figures , number individuals exclusively performed para-subordinate activity doubled 1996 2003 ( around 840,000 1996 1.8 million workers 2003 ) . recent decline updates contracts 2008 due gradual increases contribution rates welfare guarantees , aimed reduce incentives employers using para-subordinate arrangements . Another factor recent decline introduction stricter regulations aimed detecting ‘ false ’ para-subordinate work ( Raitano 2018 ) .The Treu package ( Law n.186/1997 ) introduced temporary employment agencies internship contracts . also reformed rules concerning fixed-term employment ( dat-ing back 1962 ) , weakening regulations regarding hiring temporary employees reducing sanctions violations obligation transform temporary contracts open-ended arrangements . Constraints use fixed-term arrangements largely removed Legislative Decree 368/2001 . previous regulation out-lined specific conditions temporary hiring could occur ( peaks production replacement workers sickness maternity leave ) , new Decree contained general non-specific rule permitting hiring fixed-term basis ‘ technical , productive , organizational substitution ’ reasons . flexibilization Italian labour market finally completed Law 30/2003 ( Biagi law ) , introduced para-subordinate arrangements ( e.g . ‘ project collaborations ’ , ‘ job call ’ , ‘ staff leasing ’ , ‘ job sharing ’ ) . also notable , since mid-1990s , severe limitations per-manent public-sector hiring introduced limit public spending , thus strongly reducing young workers ’ chances attaining open-ended contract public sector ( Dell ’ Aringa et al . 2007 ) .Although measures changed opportunity structure cohorts workers early careers early 1990s , likely directly affected careers experienced first employment spell mid-1990s.The implications last measures early career trajectories recent cohorts young workers evident Eurostat figures Italy . increase non-standard arrangements mid-1990s 2000s reflected share employees hired temporary contracts ( 6.2 % 1998 , 7.2 % 2002 , 10.0 % 2008 ) part-time contracts ( 7.2 % 1998 , 8.5 % 2002 , 14.1 % 2008 ) . picture changes dramatically consider workers ages 15 29 : share employees fixed-term contracts rose 9.7 % 1983 11.4 % 1993 , 32.0 % 2008 . share part-time employees rose 4.7 % 1983 6.0 % 1993 , 17.2 % 2008 . Women over-represented part-time jobs non-standard arrangements ( still recent statistics ) .At time , period ranging mid-1990s ( employ-ment protection legislation amongst rigid EU15 countries ) 2008 ( amongst lax ) , Italy ’ employment protection legislation ( EPL ) index underwent greatest decline OECD countries . EPL index temporary work-ers decreased 5.25 late 1980s 3.25 2001 2.00 2003 , EPL index permanent workers remained constant 2.76 since 1980s , mentioned , legislation pertaining permanent contracts liberal-ized early 2010s . Finally , share workers trade union membership fell Early‑Career Complexity Labour‑Market…1 3dramatically time . Union density rose steadily—from 24.7 % labour force 1960 50.4 % 1978—and constantly fell 33.4 % 2008.23 Labour Market Deregulation Complexity Early Career Trajectories3.1 Early‑Career Complexity Across CohortsThe literature individual-level outcomes labour market flexibilization mostly exam-ines changes job employment security . Job insecurity refers unstable contractual arrangements : dual labour markets , non-standard workers experience high job turnover face high barriers accessing core segments labour force ( Barbieri Cutuli 2015 ; Gebel Giesecke 2016 ) . conditions persist time , individuals experience long-lasting employment insecurity ( Wilthagen Tros 2004 ) , tempo-rary arrangements become trap rather stepping stone stable contracts . Employment insecurity therefore inherently longitudinal characteristic individuals ’ working trajectories ( Berton et al . 2009 ) .The life course literature conceptualized increasing longitudinal variation careers , driven increases non-standard employment relations , differentia-tion ( Brückner Mayer 2005 ) . Differentiation refers increasing number distinct events experienced working lifetime ( within outside labour mar-ket ) , taking consideration order , timing , duration . Hence , high differentiation implies unpredictable non-linear employment trajectories . highly deregulated con-text , social security system compensate employment insecu-rity , differentiation may translate precariousness ( Berton , Richiardi , Sacchi 2009 ; Kalleberg 2009 ) .Recent research Van Winkle Fasang ( 2017 ) looks differentiation employment trajectories shows relative stability career complexity ages 15 45 Europe . However , individuals sample early stage careers mid-1970s . period certainly characterized dramatic changes due economic tertiarization , globalization , technological change , sev-eral European countries implemented labour market reforms actively promoted de-standardization mid-1980s . Moreover , increasing differentiation usu-ally occurs first years labour market participation likely moderated stability typical later stages considering longer portion employment life course.3.2 Early‑Career Complexity , Gender , Socio‑economic Status across CohortsIn context economic globalization ( Blossfeld et al . 2005 ) , restructuring com-panies economic crises ( Kalleberg 2009 ) , job losses due technological change ( Oesch Menés 2010 ) , labour market participation employment general become less stable secure . frequent unemployment episodes increasing 2 OECD figures based Jelle Visser database available https : //stats .oecd.org/Index .aspx ? DataS etCod e=TUD . E. Struffolino , M. Raitano 1 3employment instability generate less predictable employment life courses . Two main theoretical perspectives refer ways changes labour market regula-tion shaped career configurations time : individualization risk persis-tent inequality perspectives . According individualization risk perspective , processes resulted unstable extremely fragmented careers large part labour force , independent ‘ traditional ’ social stratification dimensions , gender socio-economic status ( Beck 1992 ; Sennett 1999 ) .By contrast , persistent-inequality perspective argues traditional stratification factors still strongly shape individuals ’ exposure labour market risks . Within framework , concept recommodification risks ( Breen 1997 ) suggests organizational restructuring processes triggered labour market deregulation transfer market risks employees . risks would likely allocated groups depend-ing pre-existing power structures stratification dimensions , negative out-comes employment flexibility risk unemployment would spread across whole population would affect specific groups ( Breen 1997 ; Goldthorpe 2002 ) . study mostly focuses gender education . However , also takes account individual educational opportunities affected parental background characteris-tics ( see Hertz et al . [ 2007 ] comparative study , Raitano Vona [ 2018 ] focus Italy ) .3The rise women ’ education labour-market participation expected bring transition traditional egalitarian gender ideologies ( Gold-scheider et al . 2015 ) . However , gender stereotypes persist cultural beliefs women likely confronted gender-specific expectations regarding work-family com-mitment—even countries generous reconciliation policies ( Grunow et al . 2018 ) . findings may relevant context persistent traditional gendered work-family roles , high levels labour market deregulation , little provision childcare services ( Crompton 2002 ; Krüger Levy 2001 ) . might expect women early careers likely work flexible jobs men anticipate seek fulfil requirements master status demonstrating stronger commitment ( current/future ) family career . Opting flexible job might rein-forced discriminatory hiring firing practices employers , anticipate ( stereotypical ) lengthy and/or frequent breaks women ’ active participation compositional effects observable characteristics associated rising female participation.Against backdrop educational expansion , skill-biased technological change , increasing labour market segmentation , given reduction relative demand low-skilled workers , might expect less educated individuals undergo multiple long-lasting unemployment episodes ( DiPrete et al . 2006 ; Katz Murphy 1992 ) . Fur-ther , might also expect less likely access primary segment ( Gebel Giesecke 2011 , 2016 ) encounter obstacles stabilization short term ( Hol-lister 2011 ; Solga 2002 ) . extends less advantaged family backgrounds , might experience higher desgrees early-career complexity educational opportunities children generally constrained parental background ( Hertz et al . 2007 ; Holmlund et al . 2011 ) .3 reason focus gender education twofold . First , mentioned , Italy ’ labour market deregu-lation ‘ margins ’ strongly intended promote labour market participation employability disadvantaged workers , mostly women low-skilled individuals . Second , economic policy debate emphasized role education important means reducing labour market risks.Early‑Career Complexity Labour‑Market…1 3In recent decades , women caught men terms educational attainment , even overtaking several countries . Therefore , women entering labour market increasingly well educated . Due possible ( self- ) selection discrimination , lower-educated women persistently suffer type double disadvantage ( OECD 2017 ) . result , gender employment gaps tend widest amongst lower-educated men women . expect reflected complexity early careers well.4 Research Questions HypothesesWe first consider trends early-career complexity across entry cohorts extending deregulation phase Italy . expect increase early-career com-plexity workers entered labour market early 1980s . expect increase even acute entered mid-1990s , , period deregulation reached climax ( hypothesis 1 ) .We explore possible heterogeneities trends early-career complexity gender education . one hand , might expect early career trajectories com-plex workers entered labour market deregulation phase well , , irrespective individual ( observable ) ascriptive attained character-istics ( hypothesis 2 ) . hand , could also expect : early-career differentiation increase women men across cohorts ( hypothesis 3a ) ; lower-educated workers experience higher degrees early-career complexity potential employment insecurity increases ( hypothesis 3b ) ; early careers lower-educated women increased complexity ( 1 ) men educa-tion well ( 2 ) highly educated women ( hypothesis 3c ) .5 Data Methods5.1 Data SampleWe used AD-SILC longitudinal dataset , constructed linking information individuals interviewed 2005 cross-sectional wave IT-SILC ( i.e .

Therefore , intended emphasize employment insecurity dimen-sion rather job insecurity connected duration contracts transitions states individual trajectories . fact , direct job-to-job transitions employers necessarily translate differentiation possible precariousness long individual question remained employed occupation ( Biemann et al . 2011 ; Hollister 2012 ) .8Unfortunately , AD-SILC started distinguishing fixed-term permanent contracts private sector 1998 onwards , distinction never made public-sector employees . Moreover , mentioned , para-subordinate arrangements identified 1996 onwards . fact , 1996 , para-subordinate arrange-ments recorded administrative social security records exempt social contributions . However , massive increase use para-subordinate arrange-ments occurred introduction Gestione Separata fund 1995 . thus chose code episodes para-subordinate temporary jobs employment pri-vate sector.5.3 Complexity Index Early CareersWe used complexity index ( Gabadinho et al . 2011 ) operationalize differentiation individual sequences representing trajectories early career trajectories . complex-ity index sequence ( x ) calculated as:6 performed sequence analysis using R packages TraMineR TraMineRextras ( Gabadinho et al . 2011 ) Weighted-Cluster ( Studer 2013 ) , version R.3.6.2 ( R Core Team 2019 ) .7 event overlap two different episodes , prioritized ‘ beneficial ’ episode terms stability related benefits : e.g . prioritized working episodes non-employment.8 accounted job-to-job transitions detailed definition states used construct sequences series robustness checks . results highly consistent presented , prioritized sequences accurately reflected employment versus job security . E. Struffolino , M. Raitano 1 3h ( x ) longitudinal entropy , time spent different states , q ( x ) refers number transitions different states sequence . q ( x ) h ( x ) divided respective maxima , qmax xmax . complexity index therefore mean two components normalized . example , sequences AABB ABAB entropy , time spent two possible states—A B—is equal . However , second complex ( implies three transitions states ) , first one transition states . minimum value C = 0 corresponds sequences composed one single state ( i.e . transitions ) entropy equal 0 . maximum value C = 1 corresponds sequences ( 1 ) possible states appear , ( 2 ) time spent state , ( 3 ) possible transitions states occur.Since coded episodes para-subordinate temporary jobs employment private sector , complexity index lower bound actual complexity ignores transitions permanent temporary employment employ-ment para-subordinate jobs . Moreover , value complexity index underesti-mated younger cohorts transitions employment para-subordinate arrangements temporary permanent employment clearly increased recent dec-ades—at least case Italy . Therefore , growing complexity younger entry cohorts interpreted actual increase across cohorts.Finally , note used individual ’ 7-year trajectory compute synthetic indi-cator trajectory , i.e . complexity index . Therefore , use longitudinal infor-mation available dataset compute index proceed run empirical analyses using single observation individuals.5.3.1 Regression AnalysisWe estimated complexity early career trajectories using ordinary least squares ( OLS ) regression . Stepwise models estimated men women separately . first model includes cohort entry labour market ( entry years grouped 5-year classes : 1974–1978 , 1979–1983 , 1984–1988 , 1989–1993 , 1994–1997 , 1998–2001 ) , main independent variable . model adjusted area residence ( North-West , North-East , Centre , South Islands ) , age time first employment episode ( 15–19 , 20–24 , 25–29 , 30–34 ) , dummy started work least 1 year completing highest level education.9 second third models include additionally two indicators socio-economic status separately , namely individual ’ highest educational attainment ( lower second-ary , upper secondary , tertiary ) parental background ( operationalized high-est educational attainment amongst parents : lower secondary education , least 0 ≤ C ( x ) =√h ( x ) xmax∗q ( x ) qmax≤ 19 ran regression models using cross-sectional weights 2005 provided IT-SILC .

Therefore , robustness checks , also estimated models adjusting number months spent unemployment across 7-year indi-vidual sequences . However , matter fact , number months spent unemploy-ment endogenous sequences . Due fact results robustness check highly consistent unadjusted model , focus latter results section.Second , regression analyses presented descriptive sense consider whether complexity early career trajectories changed cohorts workers exposed different phases labour market deregulation process . adopted analytical strategy allow us identify causal effect deregulation career complexity . macro-level dynamics might acted potential confounders association interest scenario increasing employers ’ demand flexibilization due globalization , widening divide high-skilled low-skilled workers driven technological progress , expansion spectrum employment arrangements structural changes productive system associ-ated growth service sector ( tertiarization ) —see Blossfeld et al . ( 2005 ) Esping-Andersen Regini ( 2000 ) .Because consider individual outcomes one specific point time ( e.g . year ) instead survey early career trajectories whole ( summarized com-plexity index built 7-year trajectories ) , indicator could use partially account macro-level dynamics unemployment rate . Specifically , robustness checks adjusted model : ( 1 ) average unemployment rates first seventh year labour market working-age population ( 2 ) population 15–24-year-olds ; ( 3 ) average unemployment rates first seventh year labour market female male working-age 10 acknowledge parental education perfect proxy parental background , latter encompasses several additional dimensions ( e.g . cultural capital , economic resources , prestige , power ) .

Exposure highly volatile early career trajectories long-lasting con-sequences course working life , especially contexts insurance-based welfare states make lifetime earnings dependent favourable entry labour market ( Chauvel Schröder 2014 ) . therefore especially important consider processes affect younger workers countries like Italy , deregulation ‘ margins ’ labour market characterized notable age divide . article contrasted two approaches—individualization risk versus persistent inequality hypothesis—by looking heterogeneity early-career complexity gender socio-economic status . considered workers entered labour market deregulation phase.By adopting ‘ differential ’ life course sociology perspective , analyses looked one country case time highlight linkages institutional configurations employment outcomes . Instead relying cross-sectional indicators working statuses , compared 7-year-long early career trajectories six cohorts young workers experienced first employment episode 1974 2001 . used innovative longitudinal dataset built merging survey data administrative data working histories applied sequence analysis techniques calculate longitudinal employment life course variability operationalized complexity index captures stability mobility different spells employment labour market , accounting length recurrence . Even though analyses could test causal relations , allowed us display pace exposure labour market deregulation process associated longitudinal early-career differentiation.Our results support hypothesis 1 sense early-career complexity increased across cohorts deregulation process advanced . However , differences across gender socio-economic status . Specifically , line persistent inequal-ity hypothesis , found gender differences pace increase complexity also levels ( hypothesis 3a ) : women ’ early-career differentiation grew faster greater extent men ’ . However , dynamic driven low- medium-edu-cated individuals ( hypothesis 3b ) amongst youngest cohorts women displayed highest values early-career complexity ( hypothesis 3c ) . additionally show effect parental background differentiation young people ’ labour market E.
