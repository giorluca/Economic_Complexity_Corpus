Introduction widely acknowledged specialisation division labour crucial components nation 's wealth ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ) . variety ubiquity knowledge correlated economic complexity given economy . However , idea may derive concept economic complexity economic output primarily depend upon richness labour resources also relies capabilities , knowledge , productive capacities may embedded activities economy . words , also emphasises economy may produce produces , also subject web skills , knowledge , technology may relatively simple highly complex . nation 's economy may become complex people various industries collaborate share information create broader range products . Economic complexity usually measured help economic complexity index ( ECI ) . ECI quantitative matrix may reflect sophistication diversity economy ’ exports ( Hausmann Hidalgo , 2011 ) . Economic complexity term used describe production changed structurally shifted towards technologically knowledge-based production processes goods export basket1 . vital comprehend country ’ economic complexity influences material utilisation , resource efficiency , connection clean environment knowledge human capital cornerstones effective production sustainability standpoint . Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) accomplished better less order increase resource efficiency sustainable patterns production consumption ( Lenzen et al. , 2022 ; United Nations , 2015 ) . average level sophistication goods various nations produce used gauge economic complexity . ECI particularly effective illuminating causes Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) per capita fluctuation various nations . Additionally , aids forecasting economic expansion ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ; Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ; Hausmann et al. , 2014 ) . 1 Atlas Database : https : //atlas.cid.harvard.edu/rankings 3 Economic complexity grown importance on-going global conversation climate change recent years . Experts climate change concur environmental deterioration cause climate change . Understanding create operative climate change mitigation sequencers , essential comprehend economic complexity affects environmental deterioration ( Romero Gramkow , 2021 ; Abbasi et al. , 2021 ; Zheng et al. , 2021 ; Caglar et al. , 2022 ) . Environmental Kuznets curve theory ( Grossman Krueger , 1991 ) states environment gets worse income economic progress increases , later improves . Economic complexity explains predicts cross-country differences income economic progress trajectories ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ; Hidalgo , 2021 ) . Consequently , strategies achieving economic complexity could significantly impact environmental degradation . Economic complexity ’ effect carbon emissions multifaceted involves various factors dynamics . Economically complex economies often diverse advanced industrial sectors , including manufacturing , services , high-tech industries . sectors may contribute higher carbon emissions due increased energy consumption , use fossil fuels , production goods services high carbon footprints . Similarly , economic complexity may affect consumption patterns , including goods services demanded . cases , increased economic complexity may lead shift towards resource-intensive carbon intensive consumption patterns . example , increasing income result rise demand energy intensive commodities , automobiles air conditioning appliances , degrading environment ( Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ; Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ; Minondo Requena-Silvente , 2013 ) . Stefanski ( 2015 ) investigates relationship fossil fuel subsidies emission intensity patterns sample 170 nations 1980 2010 . According study , industrialisation boosts emission levels certain point lower income levels . Industrialisation linked decreased emissions higher 4 income levels , demonstrating inverted U-shaped connection . Contrary discussion , current study also incorporates One Belt One Road economies may diversified complex structure likely mix industries , including less carbon intensive . Moreover , economies strong technology knowledge-based sectors may lower carbon emissions compared heavily reliant manufacturing industry . Similarly , economic complexity also involves transfer knowledge skills among One Belt One Road initiative economies . CO2 emissions may also reduced exchange clean efficient technologies among Belt Road Initiative ( BRI ) economies ( Naudé et al. , 2013 ) . Project OBOR ( One Belt One Road ) United Nations ’ Millennium Development Goals similar grand objectives offer public goods around globe . China introduced project early 2010 . OBOR venture includes 21st Century MSR ( Maritime Silk Road ) SEB ( Silk Road Economic Belt ) , initiated long-term economic cooperation among interconnect economies . OBOR worldwide collaboration platform gained comprehensive attention governments , enterprises , academicians . group accounts 30 % global income 60 % global population integrating together many developing developed economies inclusive open collaborative network ( Huang , 2016 ; Lam et al. , 2018 ; Bai et al. , 2019 ) . estimated project cost $ 21.1 trillion USD , spanning 65 connected economies . Since Greenhouse Gas ( GHG ) emission comparison 1970 2022 also showed significant increase emissions China India ( Crippa et al . 2023 ) , OBOR projects initiated structural changes response sudden increase GHG region reported Crippa et al . ( 2023 ) . economies partnered OBOR , Brazil , China , India , Russia , account 0.94 % , 11 % , 3 % 3.80 % global emissions CO2 respectively . However , CO2 emanation spread 1.15 % Brazil , 16 % China , 5 % India , 6 % Russia 2007 ( Hafeez et al. , 2019 ; Klinger , 2019 ) . addition , whilst major CO2 emissions United States America , China , India , 5 Russia , estimated India China may contribute emissions share 8 % 11 % consistent high growths . total human related ecological footprints comprise 60 % carbon footprints remaining components buildings , land , forest cultivation , product manufacturing , grazing land ( Hafeez et al. , 2019 ) . Moreover , many studies Ozcan et al . ( 2018 ) , Danish et al . ( 2020 ) , Ahmed et al . ( 2020 ) suggest ecological footprints preclude appropriate evaluation measure influence human-created activities environment . study primarily evaluates economic complexity , renewable energy demand , CO2 emission association globally among several economies , diversified using levels income high- , upper-middle- , low-middle- , low-income , partner economies OBOR . Typically , energy-intensive businesses , power plants , transportation-related industrial activities sources CO2 emissions . CO2 emissions account 75 % greenhouse gas emissions raising global temperatures ( Abbasi Riaz , 2016 ) . study incorporates modern literature many ways . current study pioneers evaluating consumption renewable energy economic complexity affect CO2 emissions globally . estimated ECI developed countries like Japan Germany high ECIs 2.26 1.96 respectively , showing countries highly diversified sophisticated . Developing low-income countries like Pakistan ( -0.68 ) , Angola ( -2.5 ) , Cameroon ( -1.61 ) low economic complexity , indicates countries low diversity high ubiquity , countries export goods . However , several studies ( Neagu , 2019 ; Dogan et al. , 2020 ; Boleti et al. , 2021 ; Leitao et al. , 2021 ; Khezri et al. , 2022 ) evaluate economic complexity emission CO2 causality specific regions countries . Secondly , study includes partner economies . segregation economies essential economies associated mega project named OBOR ( One Belt One Road ) contributes raising partners ’ economies per capita income economies minimising cost trade . evaluated level global income increase 0.7 % 6 help OBOR 2030 . Additionally , initiative also benefit partner economies addition boosting China 's actual revenue . Gains initiative also 70 % . result , production goods services across partner economies rise real income rises . massive production also increase emission CO2 54 % globally . China , Russia , India contributed 28 % , 5 % , 6 % global CO2 emissions respectively 2020 ( International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , 2020 ) . Thirdly , study incorporates recent panel data methods , second-generation econometric model , may reflect slope homogeneity cross-sectional dependence experienced among several economies around globe . order validate non-stationary variables appropriately , study incorporates multiple cross-sectional dependence ( CD ) tests assume cross-sectional homogeneity ( Pesaran , 2007 ) . Following , Westerlund co-integration utilised considers CD issue ( Pesaran , 2015 ) . Similarly , estimators assume variable stationarity may lead biased quantification sample trails non-stationarity . However , study used panel data model multi-factor residual configuration reflected mutually correlated impact subject cross-sectional dependence ( CD ) heterogeneity ( Pesaran , 2007 , 2015 ) . proposed estimators derive efficient consistent estimates ( Westerlund Edgerton , 2008 ) . Moreover , study helps policymakers articulate notable effects implicate operative strategies mitigate environmental deterioration . research questions corresponding objectives : 1 . role economic complexity environmental quality OBOR countries ? 2 . role renewable energy environmental quality OBOR countries ? 3 . role economic activity environmental quality OBOR countries ? 4 . role industrialisation environmental quality OBOR countries ? 5 . role trade openness environmental quality OBOR countries ? 7 remaining study structured follows . Section 2 depicts literature review , Section 3 represents data methodology , Section 4 emphasises estimated findings , final section covers study 's conclusion . 2 . Literature Review 2.1 Relationship economic complexity CO2 emission Understanding environmental deterioration causes become increasingly important due global warming , climate change , public awareness problems . Leading researchers field environmental studies stressed significance simple economic progress primary cause environmental degradation ( Kijima et al. , 2010 ; Jayanthakumaran et al. , 2012 ) . Economic complexity measures amount information ingrained economy 's productive structure knowledge intensive industry . study environmental quality concerning economic complexity conducted Gozgor ( 2017 ) . utilising French data set , exposed sustained energy use advantageous persistent effect carbon emissions . Furthermore , also discovered increased economic complexity lowers long-term carbon emissions . Dogan et al . ( 2019 ) also examined carbon emissions economic complexity links emphasising economic complexity prevent environmental harm . According Alvarez-Herranz et al . ( 2017 ) , economic complexity rises developing nations , emissions rise due scale-effect harm severe . Neagu Teodoru ( 2019 ) found opposite , concluding rise economic complexity suggests excessive environmental deterioration . configuration country ’ production goods essential indicator determine environmental quality . increase economic complexity shifts production towards sophisticated products low productive agriculture economy . shift production may cause increased consumption energy contributes elevating emissions CO2 . 8 contrary , economic complexity enhances structural transformation , reflecting capabilities advance knowledge implanted economy . Therefore , complex economies better technological solution may enhance quality environment ( Kaufmann et al. , 1998 ; Mealy Teytelboym , 2020 ) . However , green inventions substitute non-sustainable primary-energy intensive skills production , leading cleaner resource efficient economy ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ) . Gala et al . ( 2018 ) confirm increase economic complexity lead increase technological innovation , Gramkow Anger-Kraavi ( 2018 ) elucidate indicators non-green innovation similar green innovations . may possible ECI promotes green innovations raise environmental performance . Furthermore , Gozgor ( 2017 ) evaluated EKC ( environmental Kuznets curve ) phenomena using ECI French economy 1964-2014 . empirical findings reveal higher economic complexity overwhelms emission CO2 long run . Neagu Teodoru ( 2019 ) investigate economic complexity environmental degradation association using 25 European economies panel 1995-2016 . empirical results confirm positive economic complexity greenhouse gas emissions association . However , Dogan et al . ( 2019 ) estimate economic complexity may affect emission CO2 several ways different phases income development . upsurge economic complexity may increase emission CO2 among higher- , middle- , lower-income economies reducing emissions among high-income economies . incorporated panel 55 economies 1971-2014 divided several income groups . addition , Yilanci Pata ( 2020 ) examined connections among China 's economic development , economic complexity , energy use , environmental impact 1965 2016 . findings demonstrated China 's ecological footprint increased due growing economic complexity , energy consumption . possibility economic complexity increasing emissions , due 9 scale effect leading increase , harmful environment ( Alvarez-Herranz et al. , 2017 ) . Income per capita squared form consistent economic Kuznets curve ( EKC ) hypotheses Gozgor 's ( 2017 ) empirical investigation utilised dynamic ordinary least squares ( DOLS ) estimator French experience . authors also discovered adverse carbon dioxide emissions economic complexity relationship . Additionally , energy demand favourable effect pollutant emissions . Ahmed et al . ( 2021 ) examined economic complexity CO2 emissions relationship developing nations . study showed , high economic complexity reduces ecological footprints ( EPT ) , low economic complexity increases environmental deterioration . 2.2 Renewable energy , economic growth , CO2 emission ample research papers association among energy , CO2 emissions , economic progress . Throughout past decades , many research studies Dong et al . ( 2018 ) , Jardon et al . ( 2017 ) , Su et al . ( 2020 ) , done connection among demand energy , CO2 emanations , economic progress . Moreover , various studies found clean energy ( like wind energy , solar energy , hydro energy , relevant energy sources ) closely related factors like rainfall , wind speed , humidity , sunshine , etc . ultimately held responsible stable requirement climate change ( Harrison et al. , 2002 ; de Lucena et al. , 2010 ; Xingang et al. , 2012 ; Schaeffer et al. , 2012 ) . Uzoma et al . ( 2012 ) found energy mix significant effect sustainable development significantly contributes carbon emissions Nigeria . , energy mix provide continuous electricity supply utilise available coal resources . Wang et al . ( 2014 ) empirically found renewable energy vulnerable climate change poorer regions China . Esso Keho ( 2016 ) found interconnection among energy consumption economic progress , variables cause CO2 emanations 12 sub-Sahara African regions . 10 , various studies affirmed CO2 emission majorly responsible damaging climate ( Mac Dowell et al. , 2017 ) . addition , climate alteration major determinant worldwide warming , ultimately , causes reduction GDP 139 countries ( Kompas et al. , 2018 ) . Rafindadi Usman ( 2019 ) also confirm actuality EKC assumption South Africa empirics revealed 7.96 % increase energy causes 72.52 % increase environmental degradation . Extensive literature available validates energy consumption causes CO2 emissions ( Heravi et al. , 2020 ) . According empirical findings Wen et al . ( 2021 ) , non-renewable energy utilisation causes environmental contamination findings affirm validation EKC assumption South Asia . Additionally , Mi Sun ( 2021 ) avowed reduction climate change extenuation using energy mix strategy 2013 2016 case China . Furthermore , new research study Szetela et al . ( 2022 ) found fluctuating toward renewable energy sources caused decreased CO2 emanations regions rich natural resources . Accordingly , every 1 % shift towards renewable energy sources causes 1.25 % decline CO2 emission . Likewise , Dai et al . ( 2022 ) exposed renewable energy surge portion energy mix causes minimised vulnerability climate alteration among G7 economies . study economic possessions climate transformation emphasises impacts might affect various economic sectors necessity mitigating addressing implications adaptation mitigation efforts . debate global welfare impacts climate change getting attention since 1990s ( Fankhauser , 1994 , 2013 ; Richard , 1995 ) . Since , various methods utilised assess measure economic consequences climate variation ( Hsiang , 2010 ; Deryugina Hsiang , 2014 ; Hsiang & Jina , 2014 ; Burke et al. , 2018 ; Kolstad & Moore , 2020 ) . influence agriculture one main economic impacts climate alteration . Koubi ( 2019 ) affirms adverse climate change effects agriculture production economic development . 11 Cross-confirmation relationship GDP growth climate also analysed using 800 plausible specifications ( Newell et al. , 2021 ) . Furthermore , similar study conducted Custodio et al . ( 2022 ) found every 1 % rise temperature ( climate change ) roots 2 % decline sales suppliers . Renewable energy also provided natural resources replenish quickly used . Examples sources never run include sun wind . wide range renewable energy sources available us ( United Nations , 2015 ) . Sharif et al. ’ ( 2019 ) study compare carbon emissions energy use ( non-renewable renewable ) . discovered clean energy reduces CO2 emissions , whereas non-renewable energy increases . also discovered CO2 emissions decreased economy grew . visiting G7 countries , Destek ( 2016 ) investigated renewable energy carbon emissions connection . Similarly , Aslan ( 2013 ) noted decrease emissions brought using renewable energy . neighbourhood benefits reducing consumption land-based CO2 emissions ( Djellouli et al. , 2022 ; Murshed et al. , 2022 ; Yang et al. , 2022 ) . Trade involves movement goods linked transnational pollution relocation manufacturing industries . However , economically advantageous nations look trade advantage trade may also accompanied significant pollution destruction natural resources ( Harris , 2004 ) . Contrarily , commerce frequently catalyses environmental progress promoting export ecologically beneficial goods ( OECD , 2017 ) . instance , wealthier nations export emissions moving industrial operations less developed parts world service sector risen relative prominence ( Arrow et al. , 1995 ; Stern et al. , 1996 ) . Due advancement transportation technologies , global trade growing faster economy . Since separates consumption production , expansion 12 international trade raises possibility environmental damage may go unnoticed . ( Steen-Olsen et al. , 2012 ; Lenzen et al. , 2012b ) . addition , open trade associated pollution ( Managi et al. , 2009 ) . Numerous researchers worldwide investigated relationship environmental variables light significance environmental excellence nation 's long-term development . issue discussed recent studies conducted . Ahmed et al . ( 2021 ) looked Japan 's CO2 emissions change due investments clean energy development economic growth . findings indicated Japan 's CO2 emissions increased due economic expansion . Kanat et al . ( 2022 ) also explored outcomes Russia . et al . ( 2021 ) examined top 10 countries undergoing energy transformation affected European Union , economic progress , clean energy , globalisation . results supported long-term trend rising carbon emissions caused economic expansion co-integration variables . Hanif et al . ( 2019 ) examined economic progress fossil fuel usage relationship several Asian nations using data 1990 2013 . utilising ARDL model . research confirmed fossil fuel demand economic expansion cause air pollution . Moreover , offered proof one-way demand energy resources economic progress causal relationship supported growth theory . Consequently , quite clear recent studies contribute existing literature major partner economies OBOR experiencing growth domain agriculture industry . However , economies still vulnerable environmental deterioration something needs explored . , tropical countries facing major brunt climate change . majority high-income economies switching sustainable energy wind , biomass , solar energy . However , economies high economic complexity , thus reflecting production diversification . 13 3 . Model Description Data study includes panel data structure 16 high-income , 22 upper-middle income , 18 lower-middle income , 20 low-income country groups estimate economic complexity , renewable energy demand , per capita income , industrialisation , trade , emission CO2 relationships 1998-2021 . Bearing mind definition World Bank2 , division economies based income level . Data variables , except economic complexity , taken World Development Indicators ( WDI ) , economic complexity taken Atlas database . 18 partner economies OBOR included study many structural changes occurred among economies due swift rise CO2 last several years . partner economies India , Brazil , Russia , China contributed 3 % , 0.94 % , 3.80 % , 11 % global emission CO2 , respectively 1990 . However , emanation among economies increased reached 5 % , 1.15 % , 6 % , 16 % among India , Brazil , Russia , China , respectively 2007 . Japan , USA , India , China considered significant global emitters CO2 . However , every year , two fastest-rising economies , India China , contribute 8 % 11 % respectively emission CO2 . need hour curtail emission CO2 among partner nations harmonise world ’ environmental quality ( World Bank , 2007 ; Murray et al. , 2009 ; Tamazian et al. , 2009 ) . Pursuing research Neagu ( 2019 ) , Dogan et al . ( 2020 ) , Khezri et al .

Furthermore , coefficient value changed elasticities homogenous units , making analysis comparable . transformed equation looks like : ( 2 ) addition , lCO2 signifies natural logarithms CO2 emanation metric tons per capita . Simultaneously , explanatory variables represented lec , lren , lgdp , liva , ltra , show economic complexity index , per capita consumption renewable energy , real per capita income , per capita value addition industrial sector , trade ( % GDP ) . Employment valuable knowledge economy ’ manufacturing process represented economic complexity . complex economies yield diverse commodities help knowledge-based innovative technologies alternative sources energy renewable . However , simple economies rely technologies based simple fossil fuel non-renewable energy resources production commodities ( Neagu Teodoru , 2019 ; Dogan et al. , 2020 ) . , Table 1 shows detailed variable descriptions . emanation CO2 used proxy quality environment carbon emanation , originated fossil fuels related sources , considered main danger environment prevailing energy system world . However , emanation carbon accounts foremost segment among greenhouse gasses essential creating global warming ( Denman et al. , 2007 ) . Table 1 - INSERT 15 Many studies , including Neagu ( 2019 ) , Dogan et al . ( 2020 ) Khezri et al . ( 2022 ) , analysed environmental degradation , renewable energy use , economic complexity connection . However , Neagu Teodoru ( 2019 ) reveal negative economic complexity emanation CO2 relationship due variations energy efficiency composition , economic complexity also deteriorates environmental quality due rise production level meet existing energy demand . Moreover , Neagu ( 2019 ) elucidates economic complexity contributes level pollution preliminary phases exports due usage potential resources order uphold exports product , specific phase , economic complexity mitigates quality environment utilising green technologies resources . addition , industry requires energy meet existing public demand . situation , role renewable energy essential minimise fossil fuel reliance . Renewable energy considered backbone carbon-free economic accomplishments accounts 19.3 % global energy use ( Dogan Seker , 2016 ) . Furthermore , Hecksher-Ohlin trade model analyses developed economies pay attention production capital-intensive products . contrast , developing economies focus labour natural resources-intensive commodities . movement production commodities among several economies deteriorate environment . However , liberalised economies less polluted less liberalised ones trade liberalisation would accelerate adoption environmentally friendly sustainable technologies due pressure competition across various economies .

Moreover , values Pesaran ’ 17 ( 2004 ) Friedman Brush-Pagan 's ( 1980 ) LM tests statistically significant , thus confirming rejection cross-sectional independence Ho fact variables cross-sectionally dependent among samples discussion . 4.2 Panel unit root tests CD supports using Pesaran 's ( 2007 ) second-generation unit root test situation . Incorporating 𝜏 statistics cross-sectional ( CADF ) regression 's OLS ( ordinary least square ) estimator ( 𝜆𝑖 ) , Pesaran 's ( 2007 ) test unit root constructs test statistics uses cross-section mean proxy common component . ∆𝑦𝑖𝑡= 𝜃𝑖 + 𝜆𝑖 𝑦𝑖 , 𝑡−1 + 𝜌𝑖∆𝑦𝑖 +𝜕𝑖𝑗 ( 4 ) augmented IPS test also considered using following mathematical formulas .

However , renewable energy demand confirms bidirectional causality among selected economies . conclusions consistent Murshed et al . ( 2022 ) Yang et al . ( 2022 ) . significant negative values 𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑡−1 .demonstrate offered economies moving direction long-term equilibrium . 4.6 Discussion empirical findings confirm positive significant economic complexity carbon emission association among upper-middle- , lower-middle- , low-income economies , overall sample . However , along increasing economic complexity environmental standards improve among high-income economies . empirical verdict consistent Minondo Requena-Silvente ( 2013 ) , Hausmann et al . ( 2014 ) , Gozgor ( 2017 ) , Dogan et al. ’ ( 2020 ) findings . Development theories elucidate technological advancement , structural change , product diversification crucial growth economy . Therefore , economic development backed ability produce export Similarly , economic complexity helps generate effective products , e.g. , renewable energy sources within economy . Knowledge-intensive commodities produced help extensive scale knowledge management production networks . greater economic complexity country indicates ability produce value-added complex commodities . 24 developed economies may comparative advantage producing commodities required increase harmonisation among highly skilled labour ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ; Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ; Minondo Requena-Silvente , 2013 ; Neagu Teodoru , 2019 ) . outcome also explainable environmental Kuznets curve , whereby high increase economic complexity tends show improvement environment . ecological deficit defines difference bio-capacity ecological footprints . Economic complexity may deteriorate environmental quality , economic complexity also offers sufficient resources knowledge , competitiveness , institutions explain deficit ecological environment . rise economic complexity represents country 's highly skilled human capital abilities . skills may enhance research development activities , improving environmental quality among developed economies . Moreover , economic complexity may also increase per capita income , represents availability funds activities Research Development ( R & ) , especially field alternative energy sources accessibility clean energy-efficient technologies , stimulates carbon-free economy . institutional quality governance competitive environment may elevate indicators networks knowledge efficient utilisation resources raise quality environment ( Hausmann et al. , 2014 ; Gozgor , 2017 ) . Contrary discussion , rise level complexity among exported commodities may deteriorate quality air , means increase exposure PM2.5 upsurge CO2 , nitrous oxide , methane emanation , turn , minimises demand renewable energy sources increase traditional energy use , especially among developing economies . Similarly , upsurge economic complexity shifts structure economy less productive agriculture sector high productive sector meet population 's existing demand . phenomenon requires greater energy use consequently raises emanation CO2 atmosphere ( Kaufmann et al. , 1998 ; Nejat et al. , 2015 ) . 25 addition , various investment companies reveal western , southeast , central Asia essential driving growth global output impending decades . Predictions state BRI economies contribute 50 % global GDP 2030 . enormous increase economic progress depreciate environment around world . Moreover , empirical evidence confirms increased trade among several economies results CO2 emissions ( Kivyiro Aminen , 2014 ; Holly , 2015 ; Jebli et al. , 2016 ) . aid trade liberalisation , numerous polluting companies relocated industrialised nations rigorous environmental regulations developing nations weak environmental legislation . process uplift level atmospheric CO2 , particularly among developing economies . However , also proved BRI economies contain many industries based coal fossil fuels manufacture household goods . industries support pollution hypothesis . Additionally , predicted rise per capita income may deteriorate climate stability , affecting labour productivity . environmental deterioration consists biodiversity human well-being loss depletion natural resources ( Azhar et al. , 2007 ; Alam et al. , 2011 ) . Tropical countries susceptible environmental degradation high population , agricultural orienteers , poor governance ( Schlosberg , 2013 ) . context tropical countries , study included data 28 tropical countries comprising 14 Asian 14 African countries . one high-income , four high-middle-income , 15 lower-middle-income eight low-income nations . results FMOLS DOLS estimates confirm rise economic complexity increases carbon emissions upper-middle- lower-middle-income nations , outcomes PMG , MG DFE demonstrate rise economic complexity increases carbon dioxide income groups . highlights need regulate manage nature economic 26 complexity , may environmentally friendly . Nations pursuit economic complexity must also adhere sustainability aspect . 5 . Conclusion study empirically analysed economic complexity , renewable energy demand , CO2 emission association among high- , upper-middle- , lower-middle- , low-income nations 1998-2021 . OBOR ( One Belt , One Road ) project 's partner nations also included study . main goal project strengthen connections support across various nations increase trade volume lowest possible cost . economies account 65 % global population presence crucial . majority partner economies growing demonstrating primary concerns enhancing economic activity expense environment . study used CD test identified existence homogeneity among various global economies . Cross-sectional dependency also affected study ’ analysis forced use second-generation unit root test confirm variables able resolve unit first difference problem . panel co-integration ARDL model also considered determine likelihood long-term relationship given variable given factor . study used several econometric models empirically calculate given variables ’ long run coefficients , including FMOLS , DOLS , MG , PMG , DFE . However , effectiveness robustness estimates ensured using various econometric techniques . direction short run causation among variables consideration established using Granger causality . estimation findings indicated , except high-income nations , economic complexity weakens primacy environment across whole sample countries . observed greater economic complexity result better environmental integrity among high-income economies . prime intention association initial stages development primary concern 27 economies specialise less complex products using heavily polluted industries . However , high-income economies moving high-intensive carbon commodities less carbon-intensive commodities exports . Keeping mind , standpoint policymakers implement policies help reduce carbon emissions among low- low-middle-income economies . Similarly , estimated findings also revealed utilisation renewable energy sources improved environment reducing emission CO2 among selected samples economies innovative renewable energy sources substituted fossil fuel-based demand energy . Therefore , using renewable energy sources mitigates environment degradation among nations around globe . estimated outcomes several noteworthy implications improvement environment globally . empirical findings suggest countries modify production commodities enhance environment 's integrity . Moreover , changes structural dynamics primary technological advancement may deteriorate environment . transform quality environment , government allocate responsibilities lower establishments . Carbon emitting programs encouraged decentralising states enhance environment develop freeloader programs sell polluting industries several nearby regions . However , smaller state bodies motivated trail severely polluted businesses enhance environment 's efficiency . addition , government introduce several programs motivate state entities utilise renewable energy sources . phenomenon control environmental damage , enhance output , ensure environmental sustainability . Moreover , importance renewable energy demands among several economies indicates countries moving right direction toward sustainable growth environment . However , policymakers take pre-emptive footsteps expand energy sources , minimise dependency fossil fuels , enhance utilisation greener energy increase industrialisation must accompanied faster transition cleaner energy . 28 two pre-requisites , along sustained growth outward looking approach ( globalisation ) , advised study ’ complexity management policy options . 6 .
