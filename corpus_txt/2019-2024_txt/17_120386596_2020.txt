Human development refers capabilities people actively make decisions participate development societies ( Sen 1999 ; UNDP 1990 ) . reason minimum standards education , health , shelter , income dimen-sions necessary empower people . Yet still many people ( 1.3 billion 2008 , according World Bank 2013 ) around world living less US $ 1.25 day , many people deprived basic human rights access decent healthcare education would allow live healthy , long full lives . United Nations increasing number non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) social entrepreneurs aim address needs people . time , cutting-edge approaches economic development emphasize need economic diversification bring economic competitiveness growth ( e.g . Hausmann Rodrik 2003 ; Rodrik 2004 ; Saviotti Pyka 2004 ; Frenken et al . 2007 ; Hidalgo et al . 2007 ) . approach sees economic development recombinant process , economies ’ technological productive capabilities formed prolific interaction , cooperation competition diverse agents public private sectors . Innovation development economists argue prolific innovation systems dynamic entrepreneurs necessary generate , implement diffuse new products , processes , inputs , markets organizations Introduction 3 ( Schumpeter 1912 ; Freeman 1987 ) . innovations often new recombinations alterations existing competences , diversity ideas knowledge spurs recombinant growth new technologies ultimately leads emergence new sectors ( Jacobs 1969 ) . Governments companies across world aim upgrade technological capabilities diversify higher value added sectors , achieving economic competitiveness providing better occupational choices . Key words approach include ‘ innovation ’ , ‘ entrepreneurship ’ , ‘ innovation networks ’ ‘ high-tech clusters ’ .This book argues merely focusing economic diversification human development enough promote sustained social progress equal distribution capabilities outcomes across world . approaches needed , complement reinforce . Whereas eco-nomic growth automatically trickle poor , neither emphasis human capabilities alone enough create economic demand capabilities . establishment higher value added sectors , providing better jobs poor , needs economic policies create insti-tutional framework subsidies required trigger learning processes well human development policies needed better educated , healthy creative labour force . Furthermore , productive structure level eco-nomic diversification country profoundly influence types occupational choices available contribution economic growth makes human agency welfare . Creativity demand-driven innovation structural change almost impossible without well-educated healthy population . However , sustained endogenous investment human development difficult realize without simultaneous investment economic competitiveness diversification . Social innovations , microfinance , indeed powerful mechanisms providing poor means help , enough allow formation globally competitive , small medium enterprises ; well-educated , healthy creative workforce better access better jobs also required . simply means human economic development policies complementary forces . , therefore , important gain better understanding linkages human development structures dynamics socioeconomic systems design prolific development policies real world . idea forces human development economic growth opposition rather complement certainly entirely new . worth noting UNDP human development index ( HDI ) composed three equal parts : life expectancy , education income ( UNDP 1990 , 2010 ) . leading researchers human capability approach discuss economic growth opportunities improve human freedom ( e.g . Sen 1999 ; Ranis et al . 2000 ; Ocampo Vallejo 2012 ) . also new initiatives coming innovation structural change research community , deliberately take human capability approach account ( e.g . STEPS cen-tre , Globelics ) . Recently , interesting approaches appeared scrutinize effects productivity growth structural change effects social capital human development ( e.g . Ranis et al . 2000 ; Ibrahim 2006 ; Ocampo Vallejo 2012 ; Capriati 2013 ) . Nevertheless , still need work increasing level interdisciplinary cooperation human development leading innovation approaches , taking account findings . Alkire ( 2010 ) , example , shown twenty years UN Human Development Reports , ‘ terms work employment appear names creativity productivity five years ’ ( Alkire 2010 , p. 14 ) . Global Network Economics Learning , Innovation Competence Building System still comparatively works deliberately focus enter concepts employed human development approach ( e.g . Johnson et al . 2003 ; Arocena Sutz 2005 ; Cozzen Kaplinsky 2009 ; Capriati 2013 ) . argued difficulties establishing interdiscipli-nary approaches due lack interest either side . Rather , due series complex issues . One natural tendency researchers continue working core field expertise . complexity interdiscipli-nary work difficulties publishing work leading journals also lead scientists conforming established dominant approaches within research community approaches . book aims contribute ideas bot research communities learn shed new light com-plex relations economic growth human development . attempts disentangling positive , negative ambiguous effects economic diversification social networks human agency welfare , presents set different methods enable comprehensive engagement relations economic diversity , social networks human development.This book structured follows . Chapter 2 discusses core ideas con-cepts different approaches development economics essential understanding work presented : ( ) neoclassical economic growth paradigm ; ( b ) innovation structural change paradigm ; ( c ) human development approach . Focus placed last two approaches ; however , first must taken account , innovation well human devel-opment approach developed partly critique neoclassical approach . demonstrate need interdisciplinary approaches , short empirical study Latin America shows none approaches ( i.e . human development , innovation economic efficiency ) individually able provide fully comprehensive picture strengths bottlenecks development . Whereas countries regions Latin America suffer serious levels poverty , violence unfreedom , main challenges improvement countries regions may related lack technological capabilities economic efficiency.Having laid main terms , ideas concepts innovation economics human development approach , shown empirical shortcomings specialised approach , Chapter 3 presents ‘ Sen meets Schumpeter ’ paradigm . approach aims disentangle analyse complex relations individuals ’ capabilities structures dynamics socioeconomic systems people live , broaden information 4 Introductionbase economic policies make use deliberately promote economic growth also human development . addition , complexity thinking used – third approach – attempt create bridges different approaches . Complexity approaches emphasize agents , networks diversity key features complex systems . Neo-Schumpeterian approaches take features explicitly account study novelties created entrepreneurship interaction diverse agents complex systems . main driver diversification ( sectors , ideas etc . ) processes innovation , driven entrepreneurship interactive learning diverse agents economy . Within so-called ‘ Sen meets Schumpeter ’ approach recognize social networks , entrepreneurship economic diversification core features structural economic change ; also directly affect human agency welfare individuals . three structural features drivers economic systems contrib-ute understanding complex relations economic growth human development help design innovation structural change policies facilitate economic growth , deliberately empower increase peo-ple ’ social choices . perspective places human development core development , yet also claims structural change innovation policies , take network structures value different types entrepreneurial choices network structures account , important factors improving peo-ple ’ agency welfare . Based approach , subsequent chapters present theoretical empirical means help disentangle positive , negative ambiguous effects economic diversification ( Chapter 4 ) , social networks ( Chapter 5 ) entrepreneurship ( Chapter 6 ) human agency wel-fare , well structural change policies need take account need designed deliberately provide valuable new social choices facilitate people ’ capabilities well-being ( Chapter 7 ) .Chapter 4 argues economic diversification expand social choices individuals ( e.g . occupational choices ) influences capabilities demanded economy . Diversification , furthermore , prevent emer-gence rigid top-down networks economy favour democratic regimes better distribution economic power . Nevertheless , high levels economic diversification , people may paralysed increasing complexity decision processes thus well-being negatively affected . Consequently emphasis required promoting real new choices ( rather , instance , choosing massive number similar products ) well improving people ’ capabilities dealing complexity appropriate education systems . cross-sectional analysis 121 countries confirms economic diversity significant positive effect human development . Export data 772 product categories used calculate different measurements diversity impact income per capita HDI . results highly significant diversity measures applied : entropy Hirschman-Herfindahl index ( HHI ) revealed comparative advantages average product ubiquity different levels disaggregation Introduction 5 ( 1- , 2- 4-digit level ) Standard International Trade classification ( SITC ) . analysis confirms hypothesis economic diversification affects human development economic growth different ways . Unrelated related eco-nomic variety marginally increasing positive effect income ; related variety product proliferation marginally decreasing positive effect human development.Chapter 5 studies detail social networks affect people ’ capabili-ties becoming active agents development . Social networks major effect diversity information help people access ( Woolcock Narayan 2000 ; Borgatti et al . 2009 ) . Networks strongly impact choices ( e.g . occupations , life styles , nutrition , etc . ) people aware entre-preneurial actions learning processes engage . People ’ capabilities functioning ( i.e abilities achievements ) merely based indi-vidual skills , national institutions ( laws regulation ) provision social services ( e.g . schools healthcare centres ) , also direct net-works individuals , parents , friends colleagues . case study shows capabilities peasants innovate small agricultural valley Peru even dependent embeddedness social networks formal education.Chapter 6 studies relations entrepreneurship human agency detail . Entrepreneurship necessarily indicate presence human agency freedom individuals involved forced engaging entrepreneurial action owing lack occupational choices ( often under-diversified economy ) . New concepts entrepreneurship functioning ( Gries Naude 2010 ) social entrepreneurship ( Yunus 2007 ) , however , show new ways interpreting evaluating entrepreneurship . merely focus contribution entrepreneurship expansion economic production , rather evaluate contribution entrepreneurial actions human capabilities agency entrepreneurs well soci-ety whole . chapter present qualitative case study based north-east Brazil shows social innovations , microfinance , contribute people ’ human agency .

Multiple opinions arguments advanced discussed philosophers , scientists , politicians members society general . Different answers shaped evolution societies , direction types techno-logical progress well value systems , modes economic production relationship humans nature . chapter outlines three main paradigms last century dominated thinking develop-ment industrialized countries : • economic growth paradigm , highlighting role capital accumulation aggregated production ; • innovation paradigm , highlighting importance novelty , interactive cumulative knowledge qualitative change ; • human development paradigm , focusing individual freedom well-being , highlighting distributional justice , quality life self-determination.In practice three approaches influence connected value systems virtually industrialized societies . However , debate pri-ority weight provided development paradigm . book aim constitute comprehensive critique understanding development ( example , see Rist 1996 ) , focuses instead relations three components order formulate policies facilitate struc-tural change human development.2.1 economic growth paradigmSince Industrial Revolution , term ‘ development ’ closely connected expansion production , income consumption . sub-stantiated empirical observation Industrial Revolution led explosion production steep rise standard living , , , unprecedented history humanity ( Maddison , 2003 ) . also led great divergence income different areas world . 2 Development paradigmsDevelopment paradigms 9Table 2.1 compares evolution per capita income China Western European countries historical offspring 1400 1989 ( based Maddison 1991 ) . see western Europe along USA , Canada Australia rapidly grew second part nineteenth century twentieth century , whereas economic production regions China stagnated last decades twentieth century.Before Industrial Revolution spread England European states North America , increases declines absolute production figures closely related population growth decline . many regions , basic way living production relatively similar several centu-ries . drastically changed arrival Industrial Revolution . fact modern economic growth rates greater population growth ( Kuznets 1966 ) allowed enormous expansion occupational con-sumption choices .

Consequently , economists politicians dealt less theoretical philosophical question ‘ development ? ’ , often ‘ promote economic growth ? ’ ideas justice ethical distribution income played role development economics ( e.g . Marx 1867 ; Rawls 1971 ) , economic growth increasingly identified influential approaches development core factor raising standard living . seen way governments favour free-market forces foster state-led development ( including com-munist countries ) put strong emphasis expansion production . Since Adam Smith ( 1776 ) identified division labour trade key factors wealth nations , economists tried identify explain key driv-ers economic growth . Economists , sociologists historians David Ricardo , Karl Marx Joseph Schumpeter came variety explanations , Table 2.1 Divergent growth rates China ‘ Western ’ industrialized economies 1400 1990 Evolution GDP per cápita 1400 1820 1950 1989 Growth ( US $ 1985 ) 1400 1989 aChina 500 500 454 2,361 372 % Western European economies 430 1,034 4,902 14,413 3,252 % ( historical offspring USA , Canada Australia ) Source : Adapted Maddison ( 1991 , p. 10 ) .Notea Growth rates added.10 Development paradigmsincluding factors international trade , technological progress institutional changes . long time three production factors – capital , labour land – considered dominant growth driver ( Malthus 1803 ; Marx 1867 ; Solow 1956 ) . natural , picture growth strongly connected visible changes : ( ) creation new factories , industry capital ; ( b ) construction railways , streets buildings ; ( c ) new jobs growing population density megacities : and/or ( ) exploitation new resources lands . approach still influential government policy ( well taught introductory economics across world ) , focus today increas-ingly turning towards institutional technological progress main growth drivers ( Romer 1986 , 1990 ; Fagerberg et al . 2005 ; Acemoglu 2009 ) . Theorizing role technological progress played important role throughout history economic thinking , seen theorists Smith ( 1776 ) Marx ( 1867 ) Schumpeter ( 1912 , 1939 , 1943 ) . However , technology considered exogenous factor endogenously explained within influential mainstream growth models dating 1950s early 1990s . growth models Robert Solow ( 1956 , 1957 ) probably widespread growth models taught universities around world form basis mainstream macroeconomics . Solow ’ growth accounting approach ( 1957 ) considers total production dependent three factors : capital ( K ) , labour ( L ) total factor productivity ( ) . basis set assump-tions , model predicts ( conditional ) convergence income different countries , long free-market forces place . Arguably important critical assumptions following . 1 production factors capital , labour land homogeneous across dif-ferent countries . means , instance , differences age skills labourers different regions . 2 diminishing returns single factors capital labour . example , given constant number ten workers , first textile machine stronger effect production expansion 100th machine , owing rate depreciation capacity labourer use . 3 Technology freely available economic agents countries produce technology frontier . 4 agents fully informed ( e.g . prices , scarcities , technologies ) act rationally : words , agents always choose best technology , efficient workers best cheapest products . 5 total factor productivity ( model ) related capital growth labour considered fairly constant . assumptions lead situation countries conditionally converge model optimal capital stock , long free-market forces place assumptions fulfilled . countries guarantee free-market forces , trade rational economic behaviour , best possible outcome Development paradigms 11achieved income countries converge , natural level inequality , example due different natural resource endow-ment geographical conditions countries . Subsequent strands research , polarization theory ( e.g . Perroux 1955 ; Myrdal 1957 ; Lasuén 1973 ) , endogenous growth theory ( Romer 1986 , 1990 ; Rebelo 1991 ; Krugman ( 1991a , 1991b ) Neo-Schumpeterian economics ( Hanusch Pyka 2007b ) , empirically theoretically shown many assumptions Solow neoclassical deductive models properly resemble complexity dynamics real world . Recent approaches stress crucial factors , knowledge externalities , agglomeration cumulative effects , lead economic divergence . book explain ideas contemporary approaches , focusing innovation economic diversifi-cation ; however , beyond aim scope book enter details various models mainstream economic growth literature . interested reader refer models Romer ( 1986 , 1990 ) , Rebelo ( 1991 ) , Krugman ( 1991a , 1991b ) , Barro Sala-i-Martin ( 1991 ) Ray ( 1998 ) overview growth models development economics.It argued economic growth paradigm takes granted pro-duction income expansion core dimensions ( least best proxy measures ) development . focus paradigm much qual-itative question ‘ development ? ’ rather ‘ economic growth stimulated ? ’ , ‘ economy one country grow faster another ? ’ well considering circumstances income convergence divergence expected . Income production basically considered development . assumed shown deductive models market forces would lead Pareto optimal distribution income increase overall production leads trickle-down effects , well increase overall social welfare population . subsequent innovation structural change paradigm also originates literature aims promote economic growth . However , knowledge creation , innovation , entrepreneurship changes composition economic system become goals development.2.2 Innovation structural changeChange , progress innovation become key words policy makers , publicity business managers since end twentieth century .

Clusters , business incubators , subsidies promotion key technologies innovation-related activities policies spreading across world . human capital knowledge spillovers , technology innovation also found way mainstream economic growth models ( see instance Romer 1986 , 1990 ) . However , book focus innovation Neo-Schumpeterian economics specialized discipline provides new theoretical perspectives meth-ods help understand creation , implementation , imitation diffusion knowledge technologies . following section theories concepts Schumpeter , innovation economics Latin American Structuralist School ( LASA ) explained detail.2.2.1 Innovation creative destructionJoseph Alois Schumpeter considered father modern innovation eco-nomics . showed development historical process structural changes 12 Development paradigmsdriven innovation defined innovation new combinations leading new products , processes , organizations , inputs markets ( Schumpeter 1912 , 1939 , 1943 ) . theory economic development , either entrepreneurs ( Schumpeter 1912 ) R & labs ( Schumpeter 1943 ) introduce new com-binations , thereby triggering profound changes economic structure creating business cycles ( Schumpeter 1939 ) . Schumpeter ’ original theory economic development ( 1912 ) abilities initiative entrepreneurs , generally draw upon discoveries scientists inventors , create entirely new opportunities investment , growth employment . profits made innovations decisive impulse new surges growth , acting signal swarms imitators ( Freeman 1982 , p. 2 ) . important note every imitator make big profits . bandwagon starts rolling , people fall , profits gradually competed away recession sets whole process may followed depression growth starts , new wave technical innovation organizational social change ( Freeman 1982 , p. 2 ) . Hence , according Schumpeter ( 1912 ) , innovation process divided four dimensions : invention , innovation , diffusion imitation . Schumpeter ’ analysis , invention stage basic innovation less impact economy diffusion imitation stages . mac-roeconomic effects basic innovation scarcely perceptible least first years , even longer . matters terms economic growth , investment employment moment basic innovation , rather diffusion , swarming process imitators begin realize prof-itable potential new product process start invest heavily technology ( Freeman 1982 , p. 5 ) . Examples technologies innovations radically changed economy society steam power , electricity , ICT . caused wave new products services changed society first second Industrial Revolution current move towards infor-mation society . Within field Neo-Schumpeterian economics , large number stud-ies made entrepreneurship , innovation , knowledge spillovers networks , business cycles structural change ( e.g .

Generally speaking : ‘ Neo-Schumpeterian economics deals dynamic processes causing qualitative transformation economies driven introduction various multifaceted forms novel-ties related co-evolutionary processes ’ ( Hanusch Pyka 2007a , p. 280 ) . Development paradigms 13Qualitative change , punctuated equilibrium ( considering idea permanent disruptive changes ) pattern formation core topics interest Neo-Schumpeterian analysis economic development ( see Hanusch Pyka 2007a , 2007b ) . concept structural change mainly refers change number balance sectors , Neo-Schumpeterian concept qualita-tive change broader , also considers changes disaggregated levels ( e.g . organizational structure within enterprises sector ) , well changes domains strictly economic , education regulation .

Creative destruction processes driven selection , variation adaptation processes new sec-tors emerge balance composition economic system changes . Whereas new sectors emerge sectors decrease importance even become obsolete . total , however , number sectors complex-ity tends increase , innovation allows higher levels specialization productivity , leading consumption choices occupation , typically sectors become obsolete , many decrease relative impor-tance . example , light bulbs largely replaced candles Internet increasingly replacing printed newspapers . still candles newspapers continue main source news .

Empirical studies show strong path dependencies diversification process . Countries regions typically diversify production structures related activities ( e.g .
