Jane Jacobs eloquently argued case cities , although private initiatives eco-nomic activity empirically generate urban development , social ideas , alongside regulatory environment shape private investments ( Jacobs , 1961 ) .Hence , cities may perceived complex social systems . Social systems functional existence ultimately relies social organisation , latter seen high level complex organisation manifests ‘ set roles [ in-dividuals organisations play society ] tied together channels communica-tion ’ ( Boulding , 1956 , p. 205 ) . Complex systems ‘ made large number parts interact nonsimple way ’ , ‘ whole sum parts , ultimate metaphysical sense , important pragmatic sense , given properties parts laws interaction , trivial matter infer properties whole ’ ( Simon 1962 , p.468 ) .The emergence complexity perspectives economics , particularly advanced discussing complex economic dynamics heterogeneous interacting agent-based complexity ( e.g .

Modern sciences studying complexity constitute collection distinct research strands overlapping concepts , self-organisation , emergence adaptive behaviour ( Mitchell , 2009 ) .As case complexity science , complexity economics2 also perceived umbrella term research agenda , rather coherent body thought ( Foxon et al. , 2013 ) . use complexity ideas economics goes beyond may fall ‘ complexity economics ’ label per se , may grouped banner ‘ complexity era economics ’ ( Holt et al. , 2011 ) . largely emerged frustrations unsatisfying explanations economic phenomena offered prevailing standard economics3 paradigm ( Arthur , 1999 ; Beinhocker , 2007 ; Kirman , 2010 ) . gradually evolved work done various strains economics research accept inherently complex nature economy , signaling new openness economics profession ideas disciplines ( Holt et al. , 2011 ) . Behavioural experimental research economics , evolutionary , institu-tional , ecological neo-Austrian economics , closely intertwined explicitly labelled ‘ complexity economics ’ , whereas schools economic thought ( e.g .

Complex dynamics associated literature ( Rosser 1999 , 2009 ; Holt et al. , 2011 ) either ( 1 ) overall , general level , understanding com-plexity ( labelled ‘ big tent ’ complexity Rosser 1999 ) containing perspectives cybernetics , catastrophe theory , chaos theory , interacting heterogeneous agent-based complexity , ( 2 ) specific latter view agent-based complexity many economists refer , invoking complexity economics ( labelled ‘ small tent ’ ‘ narrow tent ’ complexity , Rosser , 1999 , 2009 ) . Agent-based complexity , often associated work Santa Fe Institute ( Arthur et al. , 1997 ; Arthur , 2006 ) constitutes operational , formal modelling approach ( guise agent-based models agent-based computational economics models ) tends help hold together otherwise quite diverse sets ideas constitutes complex dynamics ( Colander et al. , 2004 ) .Even placed within specific agent-based complexity settings , views constitutes complex dynamics across economics research necessarily straightforward . Nonetheless , one may relate , respect , five core shared sets inter-related notions principles depicting complex dynamics economics : ( 1 ) Evolving , adaptive , systemic interactions populated nonlinearity , feedback novelty ; ( 2 ) Self-organisation emergence ; ( 3 ) Out-of-equilibrium embedded suboptimal , heterogeneous behaviour ; ( 4 ) Fundamental uncertainty lack full predictability control ; ( 5 ) Historical time , non-reversibility path depend-ence . Although common features depicting complexity views economics extracted , described various stages literature ( e.g . Arthur et al. , 1997 , Rosser , 1999 ; Beinhocker 2007 ; Antonelli , 2009 ) , also provide synthesis literature , order add debate , particularly facilitate sub-sequent discussions linking systems thinking.In relation first set shared features , complex economic phenomena may viewed lens recursive loops nonlinear interplay interacting individual elements aggregate patterns may form ( Arthur , 2015 ) . interactions systemic internally generated , behaviour individual components , system , whole strictly dependent micro macro dynamic interactions take place within system ( Antonelli , 2009 ) . Evolving complexity also tends hierarchic , interpreted wider sense intra- inter-component dynamic linkages interactions within subsystems complex system ( e.g . business firm , economy ) , without relation subordination among ( Simon , 1962 ) . Complexity-sympathetic economists as-sociate nonlinear dynamic processes evolutionary traits knowledge creation , selection diffusion , whereby agents relentlessly update , adapt , discard replace behavioural strategies decision-making processes , explore , learn interact , within across varying contexts ( Lindgren , 1997 ; Loasby , 2012 ) . evolving complex dynamics defining economic system architecture may lead ‘ genuine novelty ’ ( Harper Endres , 2012 ) knowledge generation , new combinations ideas , capabilities activities imagined ( Loasby , 2012 ) , economic systems ’ order complexity grow time ( Beinhocker , 2007 ) . ability endogenously produce novelty surprise hallmark Complex Adaptive Systems ( CAS ) framework , ap-plied important economic phenomena , largely side-lined treated anomalies standard economics , innovation , market incompleteness co-evolution , persistent heterogeneity , increasing returns extreme events ( Markose , 2005 ) .

Moreover , cap-acity interdependent heterogeneous agents intentionally purposefully generate new knowledge produce novelty , highlights role endogenous technological change explaining complex evolving dynamic character economies ( Antonelli , 2009 ) . However , dynamic settings , knowledge continually changing , nov-elty also translate , micro-level , limited firm innovation inferior ‘ modularisation ’ products processes ( Langlois , 2002 ) .A second shared set principles portraying ( agent-based ) complex dynamics economics ( bottom-up ) self-organisation emergence . former refers interplay many individual agents linkages , endogen-ously results changes system inside , rather certain ex-ogenous controlling factors ( Gilbert et al. , 2015 ) . ‘ Emergence ’ paramount theme unifying various strands complexity-based economics research .

Operating far general equilibrium steady-state typically argued complexity economists usual natural state economy , always open reaction fol-lows process continual change ( Beinhocker , 2007 ; Antonelli , 2009 ; Arthur , 2015 ) . Worthwhile noting though , out-of-equilibrium necessarily translate equilibrium , since dispersed local interactions agents lead higher-level emergent order sometimes resembles equilibrium outcomes ( pseudo-equilibrium ) , although along standard economics lines unique global op-timal equilibrium ( Arthur et al. , 1997 ; Rosser , 1999 ) . Nonetheless , out-of-equilibrium dynamics essential technological organisational innovation occur , since latter result cause former ( Antonelli , 2009 ) . market-based economic phenomena observed patterns generate ultimately possible significantly different behaviour different individual firms households ( Hayek , 1967 ) .

Complexity economists acknowledge people make socioeconomic choices differently , combination inductive thinking , rational behaviour , social comparison , imitation , repetitive behaviour cognitive limitations actor ( Arthur , 1999 ) . Standard economic behaviour assumptions , , primarily depict individual economic agents self-interested , atomistic , continuously optimising , fully rational , bundled together ‘ representative agent ’ banner discarded complexity perspectives . Instead , attention drawn empirically backed features economic behaviour , along lines purposeful ( non-maximising , intentional ) individuals heterogeneous pref-erences , local limited knowledge , may necessarily collectively achieve efficient aggregate state ( Antonelli , 2011 ; Kirman , 2016 ) . mix homo economicus homo psychologicus traits compatible heterodox eco-nomics thinking , ecological economics ( Jager et al. , 2000 ) , mention concept ‘ bounded rationality ’ originating work Herbert Simon , cross-fertilised many fields , stands core behavioural economics research ( Simon , 1955 ; Kahneman , 2003 ) . nutshell , ‘ movement economics rationality , selfishness , equilibrium , economics purposeful behavior , enlightened self-interest , sustainability ’ ( Holt et al. , 2011 , p. 364 ) .The standard criteria ( specific accurate ) prediction control valid scientific theory ( traditionally deployed physical sciences ) long ar-gued less reliable appropriate evaluation theories targeting complex ( highly organised ) animate processes ( e.g . theory evolution ) social phenomena ( e.g . theory social structures ) ( Hayek , 1967 ) .4 Nonetheless , main validation appraisal criteria used standard economics continues based normative predictive success entertains certainty quantifiable risk . despite entrepreneurship , economic evolution , increased organised com-plexity , manifested rising wealth real-world economic settings take place radical fundamental uncertainty , entails absence knowledge full set events faced likely probabilities occurrence ( Foster Metcalfe , 2012 ) . Fundamental uncertainty , unpredictability lack complete control responsive processes ( individual actors ) instead defining features complex adaptive systems ( Aagaard , 2012 ; Turner Baker , 2019 ) . future economic dynamic processes unknowable less amenable probabilistic an-ticipation , partly due unexpected indeterminate consequences human action ( Dequech , 2000 ) . suggests economic actors , entrepreneurs never fully optimise production plans certainty , since impossible foresee portfolio actions adopted entrepreneurs , entertain economic relationship ( Harper Endres , 2012 ) .

Systems thinking commonalities differences relation complexity approachesSimilar complexity movement sciences , systems thinking eludes commonly agreed definition . However , literature points two main attributes shape body research : cognitive communication dimension . first describes sys-tems thinking iterative learning process , mental framework worldview . encompasses core values assumptions concerning reality , harnesses cross-disciplinary cognitive skills targeted embracing interrelationships dynamics , ra-ther things , objects static snapshots ( Senge , 1990 ; Behl Ferreira , 2014 ) .

Notably , linking economics , early work Kenneth Boulding , whose efforts geared towards translating GST ‘ skeleton science ’ , capable providing generalised theoretical framework systems would cut across coherently connect widely different disciplines ( Boulding , 1956 ) . Another prominent example work Friedrich Hayek , whose view economy , complex system interacting individual social rules conduct strongly influenced Bertalanffy ’ insights ( Rosser , 2010 ; Lewis , 2016 ; Festré , 2019 ) . instance , noted Lewis ( 2016 ) , Hayek drew inspiration GST develop account market economy complex adaptive system , i.e . displaying higher-level emergent properties ( coordinative power price mechanism ) arise interactions individuals governed certain systems formal legal rules informal social norms.Overall , complexity approach systems-based perspectives highly complementary , co-evolved influenced . argue com-plexity science movement emerged continuation done cybernetics , general systems theory chaos theory ( Cilliers , 2001 ) . Put differently , com-plexity perspective may currently perceived recent extension distinct offshoot systems-based theory thinking , rather inseparable part ( Ramage Shipp , 2009 ; Verhoeff et al. , 2018 ) . Others support view complexity movement changed traditional systems thinking perspective , associated , particularly height 1960s , top-down con-trol approach ( Batty , 2018 ) . influenced system thinkers formalisation central concepts , evolution , adaptation , emergence , self-organisation ( Merali Allen , 2011 ) .As , literature points considerable overlaps strong connections be-tween complexity science movement , including application economics , systems thinking . First , thinking terms complex evolutionary dynamics also hallmark systems-based thinking . stresses nonlinearity ( effect dispropor-tional cause ) , feedbacks causal multi-loop dynamics ( Forrester , 1961 ; 5 Ludwig von Bertalanffy ’ general systems theory emerged 1930-40s , whereas term ‘ sys-tems thinking ’ appeared much later , 1986–87 attributed systems scientist Barry Richmond ( Arnold Wade , 2015 ) .Downloaded https : //academic.oup.com/cje/article/45/4/695/6300006 Catherine Sharp user 15 July 2021Linking complexity economics systems thinking 703Grösser , 2017 ) , well role evolutionary processes adaptive interactions , favouring selection agents detriment others , although ne-cessarily benefit overall system ’ long-term success ( Sterman , 2006 ) . Second , complexity movement , interconnectedness , terms interactions system elements ( e.g . agents ) also essence systems thinking . latter typically depicts form inter-connected wholeness holism , translates whole greater sum parts , analytical priority given causal mechanisms relationships system compo-nents , rather components ( Senge 1990 ; Cilliers , 2001 ; Behl Ferreira , 2014 ) . Systems thinking treat economic phenomena simple aggregates , rather places onus systems ’ internal structure dynamics , internally generated interactions interdependencies may exist within parts subsystems . systems complexity perspectives sub-scribe worldview ‘ different ’ , works undermine vision society mere aggregate individuals ( Anderson , 1972 ) . Third , views , interactions system elements within system , system environment occur within landscape diversity system ’ dynamic behaviour internal inter-component interactions . case complexity perspec-tives , systems thinking stresses dynamics typically lead sub-optimal underperforming behaviour system whole ( Sterman , 2006 ) . portrays living ( social ) systems open , nonlinear able maintain ‘ ordered steady states ’ non-equilibrium conditions , i.e . operate stably , whilst far equilib-rium ( Loutfi Moscardini , 2003 ; Merali Allen , 2011 ) . Fourth , although systems-based perspective largely entertains assumption structural perseverance ( feedback structure remains ) , boundaries system defined ( Merali Allen , 2011 ) , acknowledge limited predictability irreducible uncertainties , core features social system change dealing human values motivations . instance , new structural mechanisms factors may appear social system may accommodated mental flexibility willingness redraw system boundaries redesign system ( Meadows , 2002 ) .

Fifth , importance historical time path dependence helping explain observed resistance policy intervention change status quo also widely acknowledged systems thinking ( Sterman , 2006 ) . dynamics flows accumulating stocks may lead long time delays , complicating efforts break away undesired path dependence.Considering mutual features , one may infer complexity perspec-tives systems thinking rest shared ontological foundation ‘ open sys-tems ’ .

However , contend explicitly bridging complexity eco-nomics systems thinking could potentially shape stronger investigative frame-work , conducive intra-disciplinary pluralism , within economics field , heightened dialogue economics disciplines.4 .

However , may overlook factors work affect ‘ self ’ self-organisation , overall existent system structure , asymmetric power rela-tions presence fluid boundaries operating different scales system-levels ( Gilbert et al. , 2015 ) . conceptualising analytically investigating dynamic be-haviour including self-organisation , literature tends split two approaches . either underscores multitude dynamic patterns properties system macro-state level , arising interactions micro-diverse agents ( i.e . micro-scopic approach ) , associates overall system dynamic behaviour relatively stable system structure ( i.e . macroscopic approach ) ( Gilbert et al. , 2015 ) . per-spectives also build different mathematical approaches , nevertheless significant potential interlinkage.Further , cities fit definition complex adaptive systems , fully integrated systems , rather characterised highly decomposable struc-tures , ordered evolutionary processes selective connections actors , continuously innovate mix specialisation , variation within , activity domains ( Loasby , 2012 ) . connection-shaping dynamics technological , organisational operational , also cultural , social ideological , terms commonly upheld beliefs presence novelty , uncertainty sub-jective knowledge ( Foster , 2017 ) . interpretive element ( social construction meaning ) pertaining complex dynamic systems crucial feature defining sys-tems thinking , closely line cognitive communication dimensions body research ( Senge , 1990 ) .The following sub-sections explore two systems thinking principles al-luded .

Although macro- microscopic mathematical formulations deployed analytically frame system complexity aspects , latter , former workhorse contemporary complexity economics.7The microscopic analytical complexity perspective economics ( elsewhere ) draws ‘ mathematics emergence ’ ( Bar-Yam , 2004 ; Cooper , 2006 ; Cucker Smale , 2007 ) . include Markov chains ( Banisch , 2016 ) , cellular automata ( Evans , 2015 ) process algebra ( Baeten , 2005 ) ,8 examples emergent be-haviour economics discussed reference emergent capital formation ( Harper Endres , 2012 ) emergent property rights ( Langlois , 2002 ) , specifically , within context decarbonisation , domestic electricity demand occupant behaviour buildings ( Widén Wäckelgård , 2010 ; Virote Neves-Silva , 2012 ; Patidar et al , 2016 ) . Unlike macroscopic mathematical perspectives , microscopic approach dynamic complexity contain counterpart gen-eric measures quantify complexity characteristics emergent behaviour . equations underpinning microscopic system behaviour instead aggregated mathematical sense generate equations describing macroscopic system be-haviour ( Le Boudec et al. , 2007 ; Banisch , 2016 ) , vice-versa . words , characterisation emergent behaviour inferred analytically , complex systems scrutinising mechanisms underpinning transitions interactions micro-level , using approximation methods , mean field theory pro-cess algebra ( Damper , 2000 ; Latella et al. , 2015 ) .Mathematical methods deployed quantitative methodological formalisa-tion systems thinking ( e.g . system dynamics modelling used policy design ) fall macroscopic perspective , since less concerned micro-to-macro emergence phenomena , emphasise instead overall system dynamic be-haviour , interactions components higher- aggregated levels . systems thinking significantly influenced nonlinear dynamics feedback mechanisms deployed cybernetics control engineering ( Merali Allen , 2011 ) , formal simulation modelling methodological apparatus also largely adopt macroscopic approach complex dynamics . less alluded ( think , 7 addressing paper operational computing aspects modelling methods , include agent-based modelling ( ABM ) system dynamics modelling ( SDM ) methodological frontrunners ( microscopic ) complexity economics , respectively , ( macroscopic ) systems thinking . focus instead addressing theoretical fundamental aspects methods .
