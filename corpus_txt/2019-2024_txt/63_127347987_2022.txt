Introduction cultural creative industries ( CCIs ) become significant part modern economy , contributing growing proportion global GDP , growth , employment ( OECD , 2018 ; UNESCO , 2018 ) . governments policy makers increasingly invested industries revitalise countries , regions cities across world , academic communities thoroughly examined characteristics , dynamics , role drivers economic development . substantial body research focused geographies CCIs exploring tendency concentrate specific places well determinants economic consequences phenomenon . importantly , several studies pointed dynamics spatial concentration linked positive economic outcomes places CCIs ( e.g. , Bakhshi et al. , 2008 ; Chapain et . al . 2010 ; De Vaan , 2013 ; Klement Strambach , 2019b ; Lee , 2014 ) . strong symbiosis creativity , economy places made notion cultural creative clusters increasingly popular among scholars policy makers ( Bloom et al. , 2020 ; Chapain Sagot-Duvauroux , 2020 ) . Traditional forms agglomeration economies , including example proximity interrelated specialised firms , skilled workers , resources , infrastructures generation economies scale , also applied CCIs . particular , knowledge-intensive industries draw upon key self-reinforcing mechanism growth , localised creative communities foster social interactions , cross-fertilisation ideas , learning processes knowledge exchange , make businesses entrepreneurship thrive ( Brandellero Kloosterman , 2010 ; Chapain et . al . 2010 ; Cohendet et al. , 2014 ; Martin Moodysson , 2011 ; Scott , 2014 ; Storper Venables , 2004 ; Turok , 2003 ) . However , agglomeration scholars shown benefits arising within clusters lead superior firm performance , little research far looked effects CCIs agglomerations growth , productivity , profitability firms . According De Vaan et al . ( 2013 ) , CCI firms benefit variety employee ’ expertise geographic clusters reach 3 critical scale allowing rich network interactions . recently , Tao et al ( 2019 ) emphasised diversity economic activities people clustered one place contributes raising productivity CCI firms . regard , studies applied concept relatedness related variety – suggests easier regions specialise industries already relevant knowledge capabilities ( e.g. , Frenken et al. , 2007 ; Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) – CCIs . works show firms benefit proximity CCI non-CCI firms thanks processes cross-fertilisation , knowledge spillovers , spread stimuli , creativity ideas similar different types activities , yielding positive effects innovation economic growth places ( Cohendet et al. , 2014 ; Innocenti Lazzeretti , 2019 ; Klement Strambach , 2019a ; Lee , 2020 ) . CCIs indeed characterised complex network connections different typologies organisations actors within area , benefit proximity ( Iansiti Levien , 2004 ) . words , CCI agglomerations seem positively affected number , quality diversity organisations actors clustered within area ( Holden , 2015 ) . view , assume performance CCI firms , considered interconnected parts larger environment ( Bakalli , 2014 ; Comunian , 2019 ) , depends complexity location embedded ( Markusen , 2011 ) . paper , draw upon Economic Complexity Index ( ECI ) , introduced Hidalgo Hausman ( 2009 ) , test whether complexity locations affects performance cultural creative firms . ECI commonly described measure diversity ( number ) sophistication productive knowledge location . complex locations diverse sophisticated production capabilities , less competitors , higher opportunities diversify capture value many productive specialisations interactions different types knowledges ( Balland Rigby , 2017 ) . rely upon ECI proxy social interactive nature characterises CCI firms . specifically , assume complex locations , endowed 4 different types sophisticated ( rare ) production capabilities , allow CCI firms perform strongly . depend higher opportunities complex knowledge sharing cross-fertilisation processes among different types CCI firms non-CCI firms . look economic complexity CCIs rest economy . Moreover , using sectorial classification provided ‘ concentric circle model ’ ( Throsby , 2001 ) , examine different effect economic complexity CCIs rest economy performance firms belonging different types cultural creative industries . regard , assume complex locations affect performance firms within industries characterised high cultural content ( low commercial content ) . focus Italian context , long-standing tradition cultural creative sector , last decade , shown increase consumption expenditure cultural employment higher European average ( Eurostat , 2018 ) . paper structured follows . following section discusses agglomeration benefits cultural creative clusters application two measures relatedness economic complexity CCIs . Moreover , presents overview importance CCIs related policy context Italy . Section 3 describes data employed analysis provides details methodology . Findings discussed section 4 , last section summarises main results provides policy implications directions future research . 2 . Theoretical background 2.1 . Cultural creative clusters : agglomeration benefits last two decades , cultural creative industries drawn increasing attention international scholars essential feature post-industrial economies important drivers economic growth development1 countries , regions , cities across world ( OECD , 2018 ) . 1 also side coin , sees CCIs associated several negative effects precarious conditions labour , unaffordable housing , social polarisation , forms inequality ( e.g. , Bontje Musterd , 2009 ) . However , sake brevity , examine aspect paper . 5 Clusters array concepts adopted describing agglomeration CCIs different levels geographical scale ( e.g. , hubs , districts , quarters , neighbourhoods , milieus ) gained growing visibility analysis linkages industries people ( Bloom et al. , 2020 ; Chapain Sagot-Duvauroux , 2020 ; Kozina Bole , 2017 ) . particular , several studies detected positive relationship social economic outcomes CCIs , knowledge-intensive nature , social network nature characterises type industries ( e.g. , Bakhshi et al . 2008 ; De Vaan , 2013 ; Innocenti Lazzeretti , 2019 ; Klement Strambach , 2019b ; Lee , 2020 ) . time , agglomeration scholars highlighted benefits within cluster lead superior firm performance . Marshall ( 1920 ) described concept ‘ external economies scale ’ explain productivity increases , attributable factors external individual firms access infrastructure services , skilled labour pools , specialised suppliers . Porter ( 1998 ) argued firms within cluster strengthen competitiveness presence challenge pressure associated presence competitive industries . contributes stimulating growth businesses . importantly , clusters characterised high degree embeddedness , facilitates networking , nurtures social interactions , enables informal knowledge exchange within location ( Tallman et al. , 2004 ) . social aspect firms ’ agglomerations particularly emphasised Becattini ( e.g. , 1990 , p.38 ) , defined industrial district ‘ socio-territorial entity characterised active presence community people population firms ’ , yielding positive spillovers . agglomeration benefits mentioned literature include improvement labour productivity ( Ciccone Hall , 1996 ) , better collaboration ( Saxenian , 1994 ) , innovation ( Harrison et al. , 1996 ; Hervás-Oliver et al. , 2018 ) . Likewise , concentration resources capabilities CCI firms specific location encourages knowledge spillovers , learning processes , cross-fertilisation ideas innovation , 6 make businesses entrepreneurship thrive ( Antonietti , 2015 ; Bakhshi et al. , 2008 ; Chapain et . al . 2010 ; Lee , 2014 ; Turok , 2003 ) . However , several works examined effects CCI agglomerations regional productivity ( e.g. , Boix-Domenech Soler-Marco , 2017 ; Boualam , 2014 ) , little research looked impact firm-level variables . Vaan et al . ( 2013 ) examined survival patterns 4,607 firms 1,229 subsidiaries global video game industry look effect localisation externalities firm performance . provided evidence firms benefit variety employee ’ expertise geographic clusters reach critical scale allowing rich network interactions . Falck et al . ( 2018 ) found cultural amenities generate positive social return attracting highly skilled workers , turn increase productivity workers firms . Tao et al . ( 2019 ) highlighted urbanisation economies – arising industry diversity city – raised productivity Chinese firms creative industries 2012 2014 . regard , diversity economic activities people facilitate coordination diverse knowledge bases , new forms entrepreneurship among different agents industries , well stimulate ideas creativity ( Cerisola , 2018 ) . However , research analysing effects social interactive nature CCIs growth , productivity , profitability firms needed . 2.2 . Relatedness CCIs rest economy time , variety/diversity framework , opposed specialisation , drawn increasing attention evolutionary economic geographic scholars interested investigating determinants innovation local growth ( e.g. , Boschma Frenken , 2009 ) . literature relatedness related variety suggests easier regions specialise industries already relevant knowledge capabilities thanks pre-existing concentrations related industries ( e.g. , Frenken et al. , 2007 ; Hidalgo et al. , 2007 ) . Related variety growth contributes innovation 7 employment related sectors increases sectoral regional productivity important policy implications ( Asheim et al. , 2011 ; Frenken et al . 2007 ; Neffke et al. , 2011 ) . studies far applied concept relatedness creative industries . Higher related variety among creative industries implies firms benefit inter-sectoral knowledge spillovers regions able successfully diversify new industries use similar skills , competencies , knowledge bases ( Berg Hassink , 2014 ) . Cognitive proximity creative industries regarded key factor fostering innovation economic development area , processes mutual exchange , cross-fertilisation , knowledge spillovers ( e.g. , Cicerone et al. , 2021 ; Innocenti Lazzeretti , 2019 ; Klement Strambach , 2019b ; Lee , 2020 ) . Also unrelated variety – proximity firms substantial similar competences – becomes particularly significant context symbolic knowledge creation , heterogenous environment made different individuals diverse cognitive frameworks important source inspiration fruitful collaborations ( Cohendet et al. , 2014 ; Klement Strambach , 2019a ) . Several studies emphasised positive relationship creative non-creative sectors . Bakhshi et al . ( 2008 ) explored links creative industries ( CIs ) sectors UK assess contribution CIs innovation derived process inter-sectoral cross-fertilisation . findings support idea supply chain linkages creative sector positively related innovation elsewhere economy . Innocenti Lazzeretti ( 2019 ) , using data employment Italian provinces , adapted methodology proposed Hidalgo et al ( 2007 ) explore relatedness creative sectors . found major interactions occur creative sectors apparently distant sectors , seem high degree cognitive proximity . According study , relatedness CCIs fosters employment growth promoting interactions stimulating creativity . similar vein , Lee ( 2020 ) found evidence relatedness mattered creative industries growth recovery period following 8 2008/2009 financial crisis . recently , Casadei et al . ( 2022 ) showed high levels relatedness creative services creative , non-creative services manufacturing industries UK – interpreted sign strength production relationship terms knowledge , inputs , complementarities . summarise , CCIs characterised complex network connections different typologies organisations actors within area , benefit knowledge sharing cross-fertilisation processes foster economic growth ( Iansiti Levien , 2004 ) . regard , CCI agglomerations seem positively affected number , quality diversity organisations actors clustered within area . therefore assume performance firms , considered interconnected parts larger environment ( Comunian , 2019 ) , depends also complexity location embedded ( Gross Wilson , 2019 ; Markusen , 2011 ) . 2.3 . Economic complexity : application CCIs study , draw upon Economic Complexity Index ( Hidalgo Hausman , 2009 ) test whether complexity locations affects performance cultural creative firms . ECI commonly described 2 measure diversity ( number ) sophistication productive knowledge location . main assumption complex locations diverse sophisticated ( rare ) production capabilities knowledge , less competitors , higher opportunities diversify capture value many productive specialisations may connected new opportunities ( Balland Rigby , 2017 ) . words , ECI emphasises production process specific product/service implies interaction different knowledges , enable innovation production complex products . rely upon ECI proxy social interactive nature characterises CCI firms . 2 recent work ( Mealy Coyle , 2019 ; Mealy et al. , 2019 ) provided different interpretation index measure specialisation complex sophisticated industries . 9 ECI variously adopted global ( Felipe et al. , 2012 ) , national ( Hausmann Hidalgo , 2013 ) , sub-national ( Reynolds et al. , 2018 ) city-level ( Nepelski De Prato , 2015 ) examine relationship economic complexity various economic outcomes . host empirical works detected robust link ECI important economic variables GDP per capita lower inequality ( Felipe et al . 2012 ; Ferrarini Scaramozzino , 2016 ; Mealy Coyle , 2019 ) . However , best knowledge , studies far applied concept CCIs . view , want first test following two hypotheses : H1 : complex CCI locations , endowed different types sophisticated production capabilities , allow CCI firms perform strongly higher opportunities complex knowledge sharing cross-fertilisation processes among different types cultural creative activities . H2 : complex locations , endowed different types sophisticated production capabilities related cultural creative sector , allow CCI firms perform strongly higher opportunities complex knowledge sharing cross-fertilisation processes non-CCI activities . However , CCI sector characterised different types industries distinct characteristics type performance diversely affected complexity locations . regard , ‘ concentric circle model ’ ( Throsby , 2001 ) offers useful sectoral view CCIs based proposition cultural creative industries characterised cultural economic value . According model , creative ideas originate core creative arts diffuse outwards series layers concentric circles ( i.e. , radiation process ) . proportion cultural content decreases ( increased commercial content ) moving outwards centre . According Throsby ( 2008 , p.150 ) ‘ diffusion ideas may arise fact creative people generate actually work different industries , providing direct input production cultural content industries core ’ . Therefore , creative ideas innovation spread 10 sectors higher cultural content sectors commercialise content means social interactions among CCI agents . Following model , want test following two hypotheses : H3 : complex CCI locations , endowed different types sophisticated production capabilities , affect performance firms high cultural content ( low commercial content ) belonging inner circles CCI ‘ concentric circle model ’ . H4 : complex locations , endowed different types sophisticated production capabilities related cultural creative sector , affect performance firms high cultural content ( low commercial content ) belonging inner circles CCI ‘ concentric circle model ’ . 2.4 . overview CCIs Italy focus analysis Italy , cultural creative sector long tradition due high endowment cultural goods places . last decade , Italy shown increase consumption expenditure cultural employment higher European average ( Eurostat , 2018 ) . Italian CCIs mainly grown thanks flourishing tourism , fairs , festival sector , well increased innovation activities , design laboratories Information Communication Technologies ( ICTs ) . 2018 , industries contributed nearly 96 billion national economy ( 6.1 % total GDP ) , around 1.55 million people employed ( Symbola , 2019 ) . year , occupation rate CCIs grew 1.5 % compared 0.9 % growth rate total industries . specifically , sector mainly consists ( terms value added employment ) ‘ cultural industries ’ ( e.g. , radio , TV , videogame , software , music , publishing ) , represent third Italian CCIs , followed ‘ creative industries ’ ( e.g. , design , media , architecture ) , performing arts ( e.g. , theatres ) , activities related conservation promotion cultural heritage ( e.g. , museums , libraries ) ( Dent et al. , 2020 ; Eurostat , 2018 ) . 11 national regional level , policies implemented development sector , CCIs drawn attention policy makers recently . ‘ White Book Creativity ’ ( Santagata , 2009 ) aimed positioning cultural creative firms Italian economic scenario delineating best policy practices development , terms creativity innovation ( foster new technologies ) social life ( focus territories networks ) . last decade , increasing attention policies development CCI sector tool urban regeneration , social inclusion sustainability ( Wilson et al. , 2020 ) . recent practices switched focus centralised system decision , peripheral one , regions , provinces labour market areas become focal actors policy implementation . 3 . Data empirical strategy test relationship economic complexity CCI firm performance , first drew upon firm-level data Aida Bureau van Dijk database3 , provides good representation distribution Italian firms size4 sectors ( Grazzi et al. , 2003 ) . includes data firm performance set firm characteristics number employees , patents , R & investments , company addresses .

Due peculiar nature , performance cultural creative industries rather volatile , application interpretation productivity measures need caution . Indeed , growth CCIs always follow linear trajectory , frequent income fluctuations related specific projects ( e.g. , film , festival ) . Moreover , industries rely intangible assets mixed income 8 lack data financial indices period analysis forced us rely two different productivity measures order avoid loss many observations empirical analysis . 14 models ( Creative Industries Federation , 2018 ) . attempted partially overcome limitations combining two different measures firm productivity/performance . 3.2 . economic complexity provinces ECI , main regressor , computed using method reflections 4-digit NACE sector level , Balland ( 2017 ) . used revised version Balland ’ knowledge complexity index based local business units data province level ( Bishop Mateos-Garcia , 2019 ; Mealy Coyle , 2019 ) . calculated ECI two specifications : first one ( ECI_CCI ) relates local business units belonging cultural creative sector measures level complexity among industries province ; second one ( ECI_TOT ) based local business units sectors province excluding CCIs order control inter-sectoral cross-fertilisation activities .

Conversely , unitary increase ECI_TOT results 22.1 % decrease value added per employee . Overall , seems economic complexity CCIs economic complexity rest economy matters CCI firm performance . Indeed , specifications , ECI_TOT never significantly positively correlated firm performance . 19 Among province-level controls , unsurprisingly , find significant positive relationship GDP per capita – proxy wealth within province – firm performance . indeed assume consumers increased wealth consume CCI products . However , GDP ( per capita ) population density significantly negatively correlated variables value added per employee revenue per employee ( Combes , 2000 ; Einiö , 2014 ) . line results , Issah Antwi ( 2017 ) – study investigating impact macroeconomic factors performance UK listed companies across industries – found negative relationship GDP firm performance .

However , variable significantly negatively correlated measures firm performance multilevel analysis . concentration creative workers within area may indeed drive cost housing , leading gentrification thus influencing firm performance ( Gutierrez-Posada et al. , 2022 ) . multilevel analysis , found significant negative relationship market concentration overall industries firm performance . Similarly , Morgan Rego ( 2009 ) , looking impact brand portfolios marketing financial performance large publicly traded firms , highlighted significant negative relationship market concentration ( HHI ) firm performance , proxied cash flows consumer loyalty .

Conclusions paper draws upon economic complexity index capture investigate whether complexity locations , terms diversification sophistication productive knowledge capabilities , affects performance firms cultural creative sector . specifically , work , explore relationship two different ECIs – one CCIs one rest economy – performance cultural creative firms province level . findings show complex cultural creative locations positively correlated performance cultural creative firms .

However , disregard CCI economic complexity explains small proportion variation firm performance . weak relationship CCI complexity firm performance suggests concentration opportunities sharing complex ( diverse rare ) knowledge among CCIs matter currently represent key driver growth . findings reinforced little significance agglomeration-related variables explaining performance firms included sectors investigation . Moreover , line recent study ( Lee , 2020 ) shows relatedness seems positive significant weak relationship employment growth ( Lee , 2020 ) . words , according research , CCI relatedness matters far determinant local growth . policy terms , findings lead rethinking support mechanisms favouring social interactions cross-fertilisation processes among CCIs . Indeed , relationship CCI complexity firm performance exist , currently weak . could explained lack clear-cut policy setting focused stimulating knowledge spillovers , learning processes well cross-fertilisation ideas innovation among CCI firms , would help effectively exploit benefits arising concentration diverse sophisticated knowledge within location . Human capital development could promoted increase absorptive capacity CCI firms , example encouraging relationships individuals outside firm well collaborative networking activities aimed increasing creativity innovativeness thereby enhancing competitiveness performance firms ( Santoro et al. , 2020 ) . Support measures connection creative people businesses could include actions aimed creating physical virtual infrastructures aimed attracting creative talent entrepreneurs well fostering synergies collaboration key stakeholders . Institutions , universities , event organisers could play key role creation collaborative networks . 23 also argue economic structure province relative weight CCIs matter promotion policies supporting CCIs social interactions . Therefore , policy measures take account sub-national characteristics tailored specific geographical context targeted . important sustain provinces high levels CCI complexity , also places less diversified sophisticated knowledge order encourage emergence new specialisations ( Menger , 2013 ) . Extant CCI specialisation province level also considered development ad-hoc policies facilitating knowledge spillovers cross-fertilisation processes among different industries sharing similar competences . view line current hype culture-led development policies fact beneficial effects culture creativity depend structural pattern local economies ( Cicerone et al. , 2021 ) . Moreover , also aligned recent debate function provinces promotion coordination local economic social development response needs sub-geographical areas smaller regions ( Cerisola , 2019 ) . regard , increased role provinces area would help identification development ad-hoc CCI policies able effectively promote growth competitiveness cultural creative industries Italy . best knowledge , first work applies concept economic complexity CCIs . research needed provide additional evidence relationship economic complexity firm performance geographical contexts ( particularly peripheral places ) using different performance indicators . Future studies could also look macro- meso-level analysis examine effect complexity performance places specific industries cultural creative sector . regard , survey research could help collect original data in-depth study social interactive nature CCIs . 24 References Antonietti R ( 2015 ) Local Creative Employment Affect Firm Innovativeness ?
