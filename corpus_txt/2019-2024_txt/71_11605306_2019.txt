INTRODUCTION economic complexity phenomenon requires country improve productive capabilities aim exporting mix sophisticated products ( Hausmann et al. , 2014 ) . country ’ economic complexity improved exports highly complex products , also large number exclusive products . Hausmann et al. , 2014 add economic complexity index ( ECI ) found influence economic indicators economic growth inequality . Little attention paid ECI ’ link lending rates monetary policy bank lending rate transmission mechanism . bank lending rates form part credit channel consists bank-lending channel balance sheet channel . bank lending channel explains monetary policy shocks affect supply loans financial institutions banks , balance sheet channel deals loan demands households businesses . lending rate path credit channel monetary policy transmission mechanism characterised ills moral hazard adverse selection ( Smal de Jager , 2001 ) . Asymmetric information financial markets provides basis credit channel monetary transmission .

Gertler ( 1995 ) offer detailed description imperfections credit markets may cause monetary contraction lead increase external finance premium faced borrowers decrease loan supply . bank lending channel contractionary monetary policy results lower usable reserve assets commercial banks ( Pétursson , 2001 ) . Tighter monetary policy usually also leads lower deposits commercial banks impact economic activity ( De Waal van Eyden , 2012 ) . factors lower supply bank loans available , especially small firms , thereby adversely affecting investment activity ultimately economic development . argued higher lending rates distort country ’ level investment , reduce rate economic growth obstacle smooth transmission monetary policy impulse ( Bertz Kerner , 2016 ; Vernon , 2017 ; Keynes , 2018 ) . Amer et al . ( 2018 ) supports argument adding response country ’ high lending rates , foreign investors reduce investments . consumer business confidence taking risky investments discouraged ( Vernon , 2017 ) . Therefore , maintaining lower levels lending rates improve country ’ investment levels . Despite lending rates , Wuhan Khurshid ( 2015 ) identified factors influence investment market size , economic development level , investment environmental preferential policies . Hence , article attempts address done reduce lending rates boost investment . 1340 Journal Reviews Global Economics , 2019 , Vol . 8 Ralarala Ncanywa bank lending channel stems special role played banks financial system deftness engaging certain types borrowers , primarily small firms . circumstances , problem asymmetric information especially bigger . contrast , large firms recourse stock bonds markets necessarily confined bank intermediation . important implication monetary policy channel greater effect dependent bank loans , smaller firms , since larger firms recourse obtaining funds issuing new share capital ( Smal De Jager , 2001 ) . circumstances restrictive regulatory frameworks change allow banks greater ability raise funds , potency channel reduced ( Mishkin , 1995 ) . Monetary policy affects value firms ’ assets balance sheets ( Smal De Jager , 2001 ) . According Łyziak ( 2010 ) , negative relationship interest rates financial asset prices . rise rate interest lowers cash-flow leads fall financial asset prices . process results lower investment spending . Monetary policy operates demand supply loans . Therefore , firm ’ balance sheets weak , moral hazard adverse selection problems reduced , availability funds borrowing firms also reduced . “ lemons ” problem associated asymmetric information loan quality makes bank loans illiquid , absence secondary market government securities makes instruments illiquid well ( Jan , 2018 ) . bank therefore values reserves provide available liquid buffer unanticipated deposit withdrawals . years , various monetary policy regimes applied way trying achieve monetary stability required balanced sustainable economic growth SSA . Adam et al. , 2010 explain SSA , three countries adopted inflation targeting monetary policy framework , including South Africa . Kenya currently hybrid monetary policy framework involving elements inflation targeting monetary targets ( Adam et al. , 2010 ) . Tanzania , Mozambique Nigeria using monetary targeting framework . much different countries target different monetary policy frameworks , share objective maintaining price stability interest sustainable balanced economic development growth ( Anwar Nguyen , 2018 ) . Monetary policy affects volume liquid funds economy Petursson ( 2001 ) contends central bank raises policy rate , opportunity cost holding liquid assets increases . occurs interest-bearing financial assets become attractive compared liquid funds . demand liquid funds therefore decrease . higher policy rate could also affect demand broad money rise policy rate push interest rate securities broad money ( Chen et al. , 2016 ; Mishkin , 1995 ) Nonetheless , things equal , rise policy rate would lead lower price level reduction income wealth hence reducing demand money . bank lending channel stems special role played banks financial system deftness engaging certain types borrowers , primarily small firms ( Chingano , Manaresi Sette , 2016 ) . put emphasis argument adjustments policy rate affect lending rate retail financial products ( Eggertsson et al. , 2019 ; Bernanke Gretler , 1995 ) . result , country ’ reserve bank changes policy rate , domestic banks inclined follow suit changing lending rates . response adjustments lending rates , firms individuals also could alter investment spending patterns ( Mahadeva Sinclair ; 2001 ) . Atlas Economic Complexity revealed improvements economic complexity Sub-Saharan African countries compared past decades ( Hausmann et al. , 2014 ) . could due advancement production goods services country exports , including capabilities knowledge , human capital technology ( Hausmann Hidalgo , 2011 ) . Thus , article investigates link economic complexity index monetary policy lending rates selected Sub-Saharan African countries ( South Africa , Nigeria , Mozambique , Kenya Tanzania ) . selected countries chosen due availability data selected variables study period . nutshell , imperative find whether long-run short-run relationship exists economic complexity monetary policy lending rates ; estimate effects nexus . paper structured follows , section followed discussing trends lending rates economic complexity selected sub-Saharan countries , reviewed empirical theoretical literature , methodology data issues , results discussion , lastly conclusion recommendations .

Hence , interesting find economic development tools economic complexity would reduce escalating lending rates . Figure 2 depicts trends economic complexity index selected Sub-Saharan African countries . South Africa appears highest ECI selected periods followed Kenya Nigeria appears lowest ECI . findings line ECI rankings provided Atlas ECI ( Hausmann et al. , 2014 ) . Atlas revealed 2009 ECI rankings , South Africa ranked number 55 ; Kenya , 73 ; Tanzania , 95 ; Mozambique , 109 ; Nigeria ranked 122 . reported developed economies Japan , United Kingdom United States America ranked highest ECI compared developing countries Sub-Saharan African countries . entails SSA countries need focus shifting production agricultural extractive industries sophisticated industries . Economic complexity addresses question countries progress slowly studying characteristics export baskets . SSA countries known rich natural resources crude oil , agricultural products , diamond gold . Despite fact Africa natural resource rich continent , need structural transformations exporting complex products ( Hausmann et al. , 2014 ) . Hartmann et al . ( 2017 ) argued countries exporting complex products tends inclusive could influence many economic indicators . reason article exploration relationship economic complexity monetary policy lending rates . 3 . LITERATURE REVIEW 3.1 . Theoretical Literature Different views monetary policy transmission mechanism began classical theory view explained Fisher ( 1930 ) . theory , variables output employment immune changes money supply . analysis based inverse relationship money prices hold . money supply increased price level rises proportionally . quantity theory equation written follows : V = P ! YM ( 1 ) money supply ; P average price level given period , V income velocity circulation money , volume transactions goods . term P ! represents current nominal output . classical economists believed economy always , near natural level real output ( Fransisco , 1999 ; Mishkin , 1995 ) . result , classical argument assumes V fixed . implies country ’ reserve bank engage monetary policy , effects increase money supply increase price level . words , expansionary monetary policy lead inflation ; contractionary monetary policy lead deflation price level . fiscal policy role influence whatsoever price level . Classical economists believed role monetary policy limited influence real economy ( Smal de Jagar , 2011 ) . However , quantity money weaknesses . classical quantity theory assumes correlation changes amount money changes spending . Critics quantity theory suggested correlation exists changes amount money circulation caused , rather causes , changes business activity ( Mishkin , 1995 ) . Keynesians different view classical view , claimed monetary policy transmission indirect effect variables money supply aggregate demand ( Smal De Jager ; 2001 ) . effect took place changes interest rate trigger changes output money supply . Keynesian transmission mechanism , exist link monetary sector real sector . Different chain reactions linked together explain macroeconomic changes two sectors . link chain monetary sector ( money market ) real sector ( goods market ) . changes monetary sector caused changes interest rate impact investment later influences aggregate expenditure real GDP . Sterk Steyrero ( 2018 ) put emphasis importance sequence analysis consequences monetary policy steps . Lastly , unlike Keynesians , monetarists believe direct transmission mechanism ( Bernanke Gretler 1995 ) . Monetarists argue money supply increases , people hold money prefer hold . surplus money therefore spent Investigating Link Economic Complexity Index Journal Reviews Global Economics , 2019 , Vol . 8 1343 purchase securities , goods services thus leading increase aggregate demand . monetarists argue transmission mechanism significant controlling money supply aggregate demand long-run . happens portfolios used different players economy households firms hold wealth ( Taylor , 1995 ) . Monetarists also view indirect operation transmission mechanism operation different assumptions Keynesians . first assume liquidity preference curve relatively inelastic assume investment demand curve relatively elastic . Monetarists believe transmission mechanism indirect operation stronger Keynesians view , result , effect monetary policy aggregate demand much greater Keynesians perceived . Monetarists believe persistent fluctuations purely monetary phenomena brought persistent expansionary contractionary monetary policies . central bank conducts monetary policy way keeping growth rate money supply fixed rate equal real growth rate economy given period . 3.2 . Empirical Literature much variety studies investigated lending rates monetary policy transmission ( Morais et al. , 2019 ; Ciccarelli et al. , 2015 ; Bernanke Gertler , 1995 ) economic complexity index ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ; Hausmann et al. , 2014 ; Hidalgo , 2015 ) , currently literature lacks evidence concerning link two . instance , Khan ( 2010 ) investigated design effects monetary policy Sub-Saharan African countries , whether credit channel impact output investment selected 20 Sub-Saharan African countries . found credit channel considered good predictor future movements investment output . widely argued due low financial development Sub-Saharan countries , implications monetary policy strong developed countries . Mishra et al . ( 2010 ) example , added result poor development domestic securities markets Sub-Saharan African countries , interest rate channel expected weak . Also , small illiquid markets assets equities real estate would tend weaken asset channel . general , attested banking lending channel dominant mode monetary transmission low-income countries . hand , Hidalgo ( 2009 ) investigated dynamics economic complexity , found economic complexity great importance due ability predict future economic growth explain differences level income country . Hanushek ( 2013 ) discovered country limited knowledge skills , quite challenging manufacture nuclear reactors technologically advanced machines even low quality . findings emphasize importance economy produce complex product aim stimulate economic growth . Hausmann et al . ( 2014 ) added mix products countries make export shown strong leading indicator economic growth . Hence , interesting find existence relationship economic development ( economic complexity ) monetary policy lending rates . Simoes Hidalgo ( 2011 ) argued economic complexity could analytical tool understanding dynamics economic development . tool found crucial helping economies understand evolution countries ’ productive structures trade partners . Traditionally , monetary rules based behaviour monetary instruments . However , Gomanee et al . ( 2003 ) put , due economic diversification improvement market sophistication asset , markets instrument-based rules become difficult implement . regard economic complexity , Hartmann ( 2017 ) supports argument emphasizing economic diversification provide valuable new social choices capabilities , also tends lead complex decision processes changes set capabilities required people self-determine future . Within process structural transformation , social networks crucial accessing information social support , networks also root cause exclusion inequality reproduction . implies need encourage innovation economic diversification beyond production expansion , focusing promotion human agency social inclusion . literature reviewed , suggested economic complexity effect number macroeconomic variables including output , investment income inequality ( Hidalgo Hausmann , 2009 ; Hausmann et al. , 2014 ; Hidalgo , 1344 Journal Reviews Global Economics , 2019 , Vol . 8 Ralarala Ncanywa 2015 ) . shown economic complexity positively related country ’ economic growth ( Metcalfe Foster 2007 ) . Furthermore , evidence link monetary policy lending rates variety macroeconomic variables GDP , investment income inequality provided ( Hartmann et al. , 2017 ) . , going investigate economic complexity lending rates panel data analysis . 4 . METHODOLOGY 4.1 . Model Specification study used yearly data quantitative research design determine economic complexity influence monetary policy lending rates selected Sub-Saharan Africa countries ( South Africa , Nigeria , Mozambique , Kenya Tanzania ) . study period investigated spans 1994 2017 . period countries selected due availability data . Data lending rates found Quantec SA Easy Data ; ECI obtained Atlas Economic complexity data gross fixed capital formation foreign direct investment obtained World Bank . compilation model may seem complex since little theory linking economic complexity monetary policy lending rates . made lending rates function economic complexity index study investigates whether exists relationship variables . model also states lending rates function gross fixed capital formation foreign direct investment . Classical Keynesian agree lending rates negative effect country ’ investment decision . country lower interest stimulates investment opportunities domestic investors . Higher domestic investment leaves little room foreign investors , lending interest rate used determine FDI flows . achieve objectives study , following model adopted : LRit = f ( ECIit +GFCFit + FDIit ) ( 2 ) Equation 2 states lending rates ( LRit ) function economic complexity index ( ECIit ) , gross fixed capital formation ( GFCFit ) foreign direct investment ( FDIit ) . Making equation 2 linear , acquire final model : LLRit = ! + `` 1ECIit + `` 2LGFCFit + `` 3FDIit + # ( 3 ) ! constant ; ! coefficient explanatory variable ; L logarithm standardize variables values ; ! error terms . negative relationship ECI monetary policy lending rates expected gross fixed capital formation foreign direct investment expected positively related lending rates . 4.2 . Panel Unit Root Tests study employed three panel unit root tests namely Levin , Lin Chu ( 2002 ) ( LLC ) test ; Im , Pesaran , Shin ( 2003 ) ( IPS ) test ; Fisher- ADF test ( Maddala Wu , 1999 ) . alternative hypothesis Levin et al . ( 2002 ) test stationary series Maddala Wu ( 1999 ) test unit roots , necessarily series . Panel unit root tests advantageous compared individual time series unit root tests due standard normal asymptotic distribution . Additionally , Maddala Wu ( 1999 ) argued tests allow infinite finite number cross-sections ; time series different length ; allow groups integrated different orders . Im–Pesaran–Shin ( IPS ) test chosen relaxes restrictive assumption LLC test ( Perasan , 2007 ) . Moreover , IPS argued allow heterogeneous panels propose panel unit root tests based average individual ADF ( Augmented Dickey-Fuller ) unit root tests computed time series . contrary , LLC IPS tests criticised requiring cross-sectional independence ( Baltagi , 2008 ) . testing stationarity null , Yu Lee , ( 2010 ) suggests Fisher test also testing cointegration panel data . Madalla Wu ( 199 ) pointed importance combining p-values unit root test applied selected SSA country . approach combining P-values allows us devise panel unit root tests aforementioned general assumptions . 4.3 . Panel Cointegration study adopted Pedroni , Kao Johansen-Fisher tests cointegration . first two tests ( Kao Pedroni ) assumed null alternatives hypotheses either relationships cointegrated ( Pedroni , 1999 ; 2004 ; Kao , 1999 ) . Kao ( 1999 ) suggested two DF statistics assumed strict exogeneity explanatory variables respect errors equation , two permit endogeneity explanatory Investigating Link Economic Complexity Index Journal Reviews Global Economics , 2019 , Vol . 8 1345 variables . Johansen Fisher panel cointegration test panel version individual Johansen cointegration test ( Madalla Wu , 1999 ) . added Johansen Fisher panel cointegration test performs way better compared Pedroni Kao tests cointegration due flexibility , simple implementation intuitively appealing . 4.4 . Panel ARDL panel unit root tests estimated study showed variables differentiated different orders cointegration none ( 2 ) . paved way study employ panel ARDL approach . panel ARDL approach used estimate long short run relationship monetary policy lending rates economic complexity . According Perasan , Shin , Smith , ( 2001 ) , panel ARDL model written : ! yi , = `` iECi , + ! Xi , # 1j=1q # 1 $ % , j + & , jj=1p # 1 $ ' ! yi , # j + ( , ( 4 ) ECi , = ! yi , '' 1 `` Xi , # $ ( 5 ) assumptions dependent variable controlled variables number lags cross section controlled variables number lags q cross section , assumption strictly required estimation ( Perasan et al. , 2001 ) . ARDL approach also chosen due advantages ability incorporate variables integrated different orders . ARDL also treats variables dependant variables . implicitly allows variable endogenous , thereby violating weak exogeneity condition bounds testing framework ( McNown , 2016 ) . advantage ARDL test eliminates inconclusive inferences bounds test . 5 . RESULTS DISCUSSIONS 5.1 . Panel Unit Root Tests study adopted Levin , Lin , Chu test ; Im , Perasan , Chin test Fisher-ADF test stationarity check unit root . results tests summarized Table 1 . Table 1 presents summary panel unit root test results estimated using Levin , Lu , Chu ; Im , Perasan , Chin ; Fisher- ADF . Table 1 shows variables investigation integrated different orders [ ( 0 ) ( 1 ) ] none ( 2 ) . Lending rates ( LLR ) economic complexity index ( ECI ) integrated order zero ; whereas gross fixed capital formation foreign direct investment integrated first order . gives way forward run panel ARDL model ( Perasan , et al. , 2001 ) . added panel ARDL approach advantageous sense emphasizes allows possibilities estimating different variables different order stationarity . 5.2 . Panel Cointegration Test Results Tables 2a , 2b 2c provide summarized results panel cointegration tests estimated Pedroni , Kao Johansen-Fisher tests cointegration respectively . three tests show existence cointegration monetary policy lending rates ECI . study tested cointegration using three approaches , Pedroni , Kao Johansen-Fisher panel cointegration tests reported Tables 2a , 2b 2c respectively . done check whether variables interest still move together direction long-run ( Dickey et al. , 1994 ) . estimated model included monetary policy lending rates , economic complexity index , gross fixed capital formation foreign direct investment . Kao estimated probability value 0.0021 significant 5 % levels . Thus showed existence cointegration reject null hypothesis cointegration 5 % level . Johansen-Fisher cointegration tests consistent Kao , showed existence cointegration amongst variables . Pedroni showed cointegration variables . 5.3 .
