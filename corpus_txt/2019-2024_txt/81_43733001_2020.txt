Keywords : labour market , youth , gender , education , flexibility , sequence analysis 2 Introduction recent decades , many European countries sought increase labour market flexibilization removing labour market rigidities ( e.g . centralized bargaining hiring firing costs [ OECD , 1994 ] ) . ultimate aim reduce unemployment foster smoother transitions employment young people workers weak labour market attachment , typically women low-skilled individuals . However , cases , reform process strongly emphasized flexibilization margins – i.e . deregulation hiring temporary atypical arrangements – thus creating two-tier labour markets flexible permanent contracts coexist ( Boeri 2011 ) . Although newly introduced non-standard arrangements expected facilitate labour market entry workers would subsequently follow linear upward trajectories towards stable standard contracts , authors argued deregulation might generated unstable , complex , ultimately uncertain employment life courses ( e.g . Hofmeister et al. , 2006 ; Mills et al. , 2006 ) . literature economics sociology investigates short-term effects labour market deregulation exploring ‘ trap versus stepping stone effect ’ non-standard labour market arrangements ( e.g . Barbieri et al . 2016 ; Booth , Francesconi , Frank 2002 ; Gagliarducci 2005 ; Polavieja 2005 ) . proceeds primarily considering occurrence timing transitions single events , i.e . temporary permanent contracts . political science literature labour market dualization emphasizes process workforce segmentation insiders outsiders , leads increasing institutional dualism policies ( e.g . employment protection unemployment benefits ) allocate different rights entitlements different categories recipients ( Davidsson & Naczyk , 2009 ; Emmenegger , Häusermann , Palier , & Seeleib-Kaiser , 2012 ; 3 Rueda , 2014 ) . Dualization measured adopting either categorical continuous indicator ‘ outsiderness ’ ( i.e . risk atypical employment unemployment ; Schwander & Häusermann , 2013 ) always refers ‘ point-in-time outcomes ’ using cross-sectional analytical designs . streams literature demonstrated ‘ trap effect ’ non-standard employment arrangements insider-outsider cleavages exist extend generational inequalities depending welfare state . especially case conservative welfare states Mediterranean variety ( Chauvel Schröder 2014 ; Palier Thelen 2010 ) . extend previous literatures two respects . First , describe trend observed across cohorts , namely longitudinal variability early-career trajectories . use indicator accounts temporal dynamics explore – even causal fashion – association changes institutional setting entire early-career trajectory conceptualized ‘ process outcome ’ ( Abbott , 2016 ) . means working trajectories global result multiple single events ( e.g . complete succession different jobs within career ) . utilize sequence analysis calculate complexity early-stage careers using synthetic indicator account length episodes employment well mobility spells employment . therefore adequately reflects life course concept working-life differentiation : greater number states episodes experienced time , higher differentiation ( Brückner Mayer 2005 ) . Stability usually defined opposition frequent mobility different jobs , contracts , arrangements , whereas mobility often refers frequent transitions , employment unemployment vice versa , well different contractual arrangements . workers move permanent temporary contracts , experience downward transitions . Hence mobility patterns might generate employment trajectories linear upwardly sloped , i.e . imply progression toward desirable 4 positions . Stability linearity especially relevant workers early stages careers : different levels exposure highly volatile trajectories point might long-lasting consequences ( ) individual ’ working life ( Kohli 2007 ) . Ultimately , early-career differentiation highly deregulated context may expose outsiders high precariousness , conceptualized ‘ employment uncertain , unpredictable , risky point view worker ’ ( Kalleberg , 2009:2 ) . Second , consider trends across cohorts early-career complexity differ worker ’ gender socio-economic status ( education parental background ) . background increasing deregulation , individualization risk perspective suggests increase employment uncertainty affect individuals equally ( Beck 1992 ; Sennett 1999 ) lead generalization unpredictable precarious careers . contrast , persistent inequality perspective argues inequality patterns based traditional stratification factors continue shape individuals ’ exposure labour market risks ( Breen 1997 ; Goldthorpe 2002 ) . Specifically , assumes ongoing process recommodification risk linked labour market deregulation affects workers exposed market fluctuations fewer background resources rely . workers typically new entrants labour market , especially women and/or low socio-economic status groups . focus Italy , flexibilization reforms mid-1990s/mid-2000s deregulated non-standard arrangements . Although employment rates increased , caused massive growth temporary atypical contracts , employment protection limited ( Boeri 2011 ) . Italian economic model traditionally characterized high rates youth unemployment , low rates female participation , sizable proportion ( low-skilled ) individuals working informal economy . reforms ‘ margins ’ ( less 5 directly ) targeted new entrants , engendered age cohort gaps access protected labour market segment . result , contexts characterized Mediterranean welfare state , differences protected/unprotected older/younger workers overlapped traditional distinction outsiders insiders ( Barbieri & Scherer , 2009 ; Chauvel & Schröder , 2014 ; Palier & Thelen , 2010 ; Rueda , 2014 ) . backdrop , considering longitudinal variability differentiation early career trajectories young workers entering labour market across cohorts gender education offers insights actual consequences insiders/outsiders cleavage terms precariousness . fact , Italy represents important case study comparative social policy worth studying depth per se least two reasons . First , process reforms towards progressive flexibilization lead peculiar two-tier segmentation several implications inequality opportunity inequality outcomes ( Boeri 2011 ; Esping-Andersen Regini 2000 ; Henrichs Jessoula 2012 ) . Second , international economic literature focused prominently wage profiles entry phase ( , episodes non-zero-wages ) careers , showing Italy outlier international comparisons wage experience patterns across cohorts mostly declined recent decades high-skilled workers ( Beaudry Green 2000 ; Fitzenberger et al . 2001 ; Mishel 2012 ; Naticchioni , Raitano , Vittori 2016 ; Rosolia Torrini 2016 ) . However , thorough account cohort dynamics early-career patterns incorporate ( multiple ) transitions unemployment employment states better characterize Italian case still missing existing scholarship . use innovative longitudinal dataset built combining survey data administrative information working histories . analyse seven-year-long early careers , starting first employment episode across six cohorts young Italian workers entered labour market 1974 2001 . means compare complexity early-career trajectories 6 across cohorts workers exposed increasing degrees labour market deregulation . looking single country , adopt ‘ differential ’ life course sociology perspective studies country cases time highlight linkages institutional configurations life course outcomes instead comparing broad categories welfare state regimes ( Mayer 2005 ) . Italian institutional background mid-1980s early 2000s , Italian government approved several labour market reforms ease constraints temporary hiring introduce new contractual arrangements . Italy , Mediterranean countries , deregulation promoted way ( ideally ) boosting participation vulnerable workers , women , workers age 50 , low-skilled individuals , young people , immigrants ( Vesan 2009 ) . reforms fostered deregulation process ‘ partial selective ’ ( Esping-Andersen Regini 2000 ) targeted ‘ margins ’ labour market system , , non-standard employment . Unlike European countries , access protected labour market segments uneven based skills differentials ( Giesecke Groß 2003 ) , Italy severe cleavage existed older younger cohorts workers ( Barbieri , 2009 ) . Older workers remained core segment , new entrants found difficult move periphery ( e.g . Barbieri et al. , 2016 ) .1 1 reduction unfair dismissal protection offered standard contracts introduced much later , 2012 2015 , whereas deregulation fixed-term contracts occurred 2014 . 7 Table 1 shows timeline reforms connects cohorts workers whose early careers affected . article , focus individuals entered labour market period 1974 2001 follow seven-year-long observational window starting first work episode . Therefore , empirical analyses concern workers whose early careers unfolded 2008 economic crisis . [ Table 1 ] mid-1980s , number regulations introduced increase part-time employment , raise maximum age apprenticeships , facilitate job training ( e.g . internships ) , well allow reintegration long-term unemployed workers . first set reforms affected early careers individuals entered labour market late 1970s . Subsequent reforms extend apprenticeship training contracts broader range sectors , took place early 1990s , affected workers entered late 1980s . Following , specific public pension fund introduced 1995 ( Gestione Separata , implemented 1996 ) para-subordinate workers – also termed dependent self-employed workers . individuals self-employed legal terms , work risk formally subordinate employer , often ‘ economically dependent ’ employer cases , activity relies upon one extremely small number clients ( Raitano , 2018 ) . phase , deregulation reached crucial turning point : creation fund institutionalized para- subordinate collaboration contracts ( hiring firing costs , low social security guarantees , reduced pension contribution rates applied recent reforms ) . consequence , firms started using contracts large scale instead standard employment 8 arrangements . reform , workers ( mostly freelance researchers ) hired para-subordinate contracts . According INPS ( Italian National Social Security Institute ) figures , number individuals exclusively performed para-subordinate activity doubled 1996 2003 ( around 840,000 1996 1.8 million workers 2003 ) . recent decline updates contracts 2008 due gradual increases contribution rates welfare guarantees , aimed reduce incentives employers using para- subordinate arrangements . Another factor recent decline introduction stricter regulations aimed detecting ‘ false ’ para-subordinate work ( Raitano , 2018 ) . Treu package ( Law n.186/1997 ) introduced temporary employment agencies internship contracts . also reformed rules concerning fixed-term employment ( dating back 1962 ) , weakening regulations regarding hiring temporary employees reducing sanctions violations obligation transform temporary contracts open-ended arrangements . Constraints use fixed-term arrangements largely removed Legislative Decree 368/2001 . previous regulation outlined specific conditions temporary hiring could occur ( peaks production replacement workers sickness maternity leave ) , new Decree contained general non-specific rule permitting hiring fixed-term basis ‘ technical , productive , organizational substitution ’ reasons . flexibilization Italian labour market finally completed Law 30/2003 ( Biagi law ) , introduced para-subordinate arrangements ( e.g . ‘ project collaborations ’ , ‘ job call ’ , ‘ staff leasing ’ , ‘ job sharing ’ ) . also notable , since mid-1990s , severe limitations permanent public-sector hiring introduced limit public spending , thus strongly reducing young workers ’ chances attaining open-ended contract public sector ( Dell ’ Aringa et al. , 2007 ) . 9 Although measures changed opportunity structure cohorts workers early careers early 1990s , likely directly affected careers experienced first employment spell mid-1990s . implications last measures early career trajectories recent cohorts young workers evident Eurostat figures Italy . increase non-standard arrangements mid-1990s 2000s reflected share employees hired temporary contracts ( 6.2 % 1998 , 7.2 % 2002 , 10.0 % 2008 ) part-time contracts ( 7.2 % 1998 , 8.5 % 2002 , 14.1 % 2008 ) . picture changes dramatically consider workers ages 15 29 : share employees fixed-term contracts rose 9.7 % 1983 11.4 % 1993 , 32.0 % 2008 . share part-time employees rose 4.7 % 1983 6.0 % 1993 , 17.2 % 2008 . Women over-represented part-time jobs non-standard arrangements ( still recent statistics ) . time , period ranging mid-1990s ( employment protection legislation amongst rigid EU15 countries ) 2008 ( amongst lax ) , Italy ’ employment protection legislation ( EPL ) index underwent greatest decline OECD countries . EPL index temporary workers decreased 5.25 late 1980s 3.25 2001 2.00 2003 , EPL index permanent workers remained constant 2.76 since 1980s , mentioned , legislation pertaining permanent contracts liberalized early 2010s . Finally , share workers trade union 10 membership fell dramatically time . Union density rose steadily – 24.7 % labour force 1960 50.4 % 1978 – constantly fell 33.4 % 2008.2 Labour market deregulation complexity early career trajectories Early-career complexity across cohorts literature individual-level outcomes labour market flexibilization mostly examines changes job employment security . Job insecurity refers unstable contractual arrangements : dual labour markets , non-standard workers experience high job turnover face high barriers accessing core segments labour force ( Barbieri & Cutuli , 2015 ; Gebel & Giesecke , 2016 ) . conditions persist time , individuals experience long-lasting employment insecurity ( Wilthagen Tros 2004 ) , temporary arrangements become trap rather stepping stone stable contracts . Employment insecurity therefore inherently longitudinal characteristic individuals ’ working trajectories ( Berton et al. , 2009 ) . life course literature conceptualized increasing longitudinal variation careers , driven increases non-standard employment relations , differentiation ( Brückner Mayer 2005 ) . Differentiation refers increasing number distinct events experienced working lifetime ( within outside labour market ) , taking consideration order , timing , duration . Hence , high differentiation implies unpredictable non-linear employment trajectories . highly deregulated context , social security system compensate 2 OECD figures based Jelle Visser database available https : //stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx ? DataSetCode=TUD 11 employment insecurity , differentiation may translate precariousness ( Berton , Richiardi , Sacchi 2009 ; Kalleberg 2009 ) . Recent research Van Winkle Fasang ( 2017 ) looks differentiation employment trajectories shows relative stability career complexity ages 15 45 Europe . However , individuals sample early stage careers mid-1970s . period certainly characterized dramatic changes due economic tertiarization , globalization , technological change , several European countries implemented labour market reforms actively promoted de-standardization mid-1980s . Moreover , increasing differentiation usually occurs first years labour market participation likely moderated stability typical later stages considering longer portion employment life course . Early-career complexity , gender , socio-economic status across cohorts context economic globalization ( Blossfeld et al. , 2005 ) , restructuring companies economic crises ( Kalleberg , 2009 ) , job losses due technological change ( Oesch Rodríguez Menés 2010 ) , labour market participation employment general become less stable secure . frequent unemployment episodes increasing employment instability generate less predictable employment life courses . Two main theoretical perspectives refer ways changes labour market regulation shaped career configurations time : individualization risk persistent inequality perspectives . According individualization risk perspective , processes resulted unstable extremely fragmented careers large part labour force , independent ‘ traditional ’ social stratification dimensions , gender socio-economic status ( Beck 1992 ; Sennett 1999 ) . 12 contrast , persistent-inequality perspective argues traditional stratification factors still strongly shape individuals ’ exposure labour market risks . Within framework , concept recommodification risks ( Breen , 1997 ) suggests organizational restructuring processes triggered labour market deregulation transfer market risks employees . risks would likely allocated groups depending pre-existing power structures stratification dimensions , negative outcomes employment flexibility risk unemployment would spread across whole population would affect specific groups ( Breen 1997 ; Goldthorpe 2002 ) . study mostly focuses gender education . However , also takes account individual educational opportunities affected parental background characteristics ( see Hertz et al . [ 2007 ] comparative study , Raitano & Vona [ 2018 ] focus Italy ) .3 rise women ’ education labour-market participation expected bring transition traditional egalitarian gender ideologies ( Goldscheider et al. , 2015 ) . However , gender stereotypes persist cultural beliefs women likely confronted gender-specific expectations regarding work-family commitment – even countries generous reconciliation policies ( Grunow et al. , 2018 ) . findings may relevant context persistent traditional gendered work-family roles , high levels labour market deregulation , little provision childcare services ( Crompton 2002 ; Krüger Levy 2001 ) . might expect women 3 two reasons focusing gender education . First , mentioned , Italy ’ labour market deregulation ‘ margins ’ strongly intended promote labour market participation employability disadvantaged workers , mostly women low-skilled individuals . Second , economic policy debate emphasized role education important means reducing labour market risks . 13 early careers likely work flexible jobs men anticipate seek fulfil requirements master status demonstrating stronger commitment ( current/future ) family career . Opting flexible job might reinforced discriminatory hiring firing practices employers , anticipate ( stereotypical ) lengthy and/or frequent breaks women ’ active participation compositional effects observable characteristics associated rising female participation . backdrop educational expansion , skill-biased technological change , increasing labour market segmentation , given reduction relative demand low-skilled workers , might expect less educated individuals undergo multiple long-lasting unemployment episodes ( DiPrete et al. , 2006 ; Katz & Murphy , 1992 ) . , might also expect less likely access primary segment ( Gebel & Giesecke , 2011 , 2016 ) encounter obstacles stabilization short term ( Hollister , 2011 ; Solga , 2002 ) . extends less advantaged family backgrounds , might experience higher degrees early-career complexity educational opportunities children generally constrained parental background ( Hertz et al. , 2007 ; Holmlund et al. , 2011 ) . recent decades , women caught men terms educational attainment , even overtaking several countries . Therefore , women entering labour market increasingly well educated . Due possible ( self- ) selection discrimination , lower-educated women persistently suffer type double disadvantage ( OECD 2017 ) . result , gender employment gaps tend widest amongst lower-educated men women . expect reflected complexity early careers well . Research questions hypotheses 14 first consider trends early-career complexity across entry cohorts extending deregulation phase Italy . expect increase early-career complexity workers entered labour market early 1980s . expect increase even acute entered mid-1990s , , period deregulation reached climax ( hypothesis 1 ) . explore possible heterogeneities trends early-career complexity gender education . one hand , might expect early career trajectories complex workers entered labour market deregulation phase well , , irrespective individual ( observable ) ascriptive attained characteristics ( hypothesis 2 ) . hand , could also expect : early-career differentiation increase women men across cohorts ( hypothesis 3a ) ; lower-educated workers experience higher degrees early-career complexity potential employment insecurity increases ( hypothesis 3b ) ; early careers lower-educated women increased complexity ( ) men education well ( ii ) highly educated women ( hypothesis 3c ) . Data methods Data sample used AD-SILC longitudinal dataset , constructed linking information individuals interviewed 2005 cross-sectional wave IT-SILC ( i.e . Italian component European Union Statistics Income Living Conditions–EU-SILC ) administrative longitudinal records job relationships individual experienced 2009 provided INPS ( Italian National Social Security Institute ) .

[ Table 2 ] Sequence construction 4 year highest qualification attained recorded EU-SILC . 5 Italy , 13 weeks threshold eligibility unemployment benefits . 16 adopting sequence analysis framework , 6 conceptualized early career trajectories sequences categorical states analysed unfold time rather set isolated elements ( Abbott , 1995 ) . objects study therefore entire trajectories instead single transitions durations specific states : understood early careers individual realizations ‘ process outcome ’ entailed aggregate-level patterns regularities ( Abbott , 2016 ; Aisenbrey & Fasang , 2010 ) . constructed 84-month-long sequences coding month according labour-market status time point:7 apprenticeship , full-time employment private sector , part-time employment private sector , employment public sector ( distinguish part-time full-time arrangements public sector ) , self-employment ( merchants , craftsmen , farmers ) , professionals ( e.g . lawyers , architects , physicians ) , joblessness ( due unemployment inactivity ) . approach take account transitions different jobs/employers contractual arrangement change ( e.g . transitions full-time contracts private sector ) . Therefore , intended emphasize employment insecurity dimension rather job insecurity connected duration contracts transitions states individual trajectories . fact , direct job-to-job transitions employers necessarily translate 6 performed sequence analysis using R packages TraMineR TraMineRextras ( Gabadinho et al. , 2011 ) Weighted-Cluster ( Studer 2013 ) , version R.3.6.2 ( R Core Team 2019 ) . 7 event overlap two different episodes , prioritized ‘ beneficial ’ episode terms stability related benefits : e.g . prioritized working episodes non-employment . 17 differentiation possible precariousness long individual question remained employed occupation ( Biemann et al. , 2011 ; Hollister , 2012 ) .8 Unfortunately , AD-SILC began distinguishing fixed-term permanent contracts private sector 1998 onwards , distinction never made public- sector employees . Moreover , mentioned , para-subordinate arrangements identified 1996 onwards . fact , 1996 , para-subordinate arrangements recorded administrative social security records exempt social contributions . However , massive increase use para-subordinate arrangements occurred introduction Gestione Separata fund 1995 . thus chose code episodes para-subordinate temporary jobs employment private sector . Complexity index early careers used complexity index ( Gabadinho et al . 2011 ) operationalize differentiation individual sequences representing trajectories early career trajectories . complexity index sequence ( x ) calculated : 0 ≤ 𝐶 ( 𝑥 ) = √ ℎ ( 𝑥 ) 𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∗ 𝑞 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑞𝑚𝑎𝑥 ≤ 1 8 accounted job-to-job transitions detailed definition states used construct sequences series robustness checks . results highly consistent presented , prioritized sequences accurately reflected employment versus job security . 18 ℎ ( 𝑥 ) longitudinal entropy , time spent different states , 𝑞 ( 𝑥 ) refers number transitions different states sequence . 𝑞 ( 𝑥 ) ℎ ( 𝑥 ) divided respective maxima , 𝑞𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 . complexity index therefore mean two components normalized . example , sequences 𝐴𝐴𝐵𝐵 𝐴𝐵𝐴𝐵 entropy , time spent two possible states – B – equal . However , second complex ( implies three transitions states ) , first one transition states . minimum value C=0 corresponds sequences composed one single state ( i.e . transitions ) entropy equal 0 . maximum value C=1 corresponds sequences ( ) possible states appear , ( ii ) time spent state , ( iii ) possible transitions states occur . Since coded episodes para-subordinate temporary jobs employment private sector , complexity index lower bound actual complexity ignores transitions permanent temporary employment employment para-subordinate jobs . Moreover , value complexity index underestimated younger cohorts transitions employment para-subordinate arrangements temporary permanent employment clearly increased recent decades – least case Italy . Therefore , growing complexity younger entry cohorts interpreted actual increase across cohorts . Finally , note used individual ’ seven-year trajectory compute synthetic indicator trajectory , i.e . complexity index . Therefore , use longitudinal information available dataset compute index proceed run empirical analyses using single observation individuals . Regression analysis 19 estimated complexity early career trajectories using ordinary least squares ( OLS ) regression . Stepwise models estimated men women separately . first model includes cohorts entry labour market ( entry years grouped five-year classes : 1974–1978 , 1979–1983 , 1984–1988 , 1989–1993 , 1994–1997 , 1998–2001 – main independent variable ) adjusted area residence ( North-West , North-East , Centre , South Islands ) , age time first employment episode ( 15–19 , 20–24 , 25–29 , 30–34 ) , dummy started work least one year completing highest level education.9 second third models include two indicators socio-economic status separately , namely individual ’ highest educational attainment ( lower secondary , upper secondary , tertiary ) parental background ( operationalized highest educational attainment amongst parents : lower secondary education , least upper secondary education ) .10 Finally , fourth model includes individual educational attainment parental background . Formally : 9 ran regression models using cross-sectional weights 2005 provided IT-SILC . Therefore , analytical sample representative population living Italy 2005 ( excluding migrants ) labour market entry cohort defined AD-SILC retrospective panel . 10 acknowledge parental education perfect proxy parental background , latter encompasses several additional dimensions ( e.g . cultural capital , economic resources , prestige , power ) . AD-SILC include information parental incomes available occupational classification allow us precisely define social class . Therefore , opted use parents ’ education instead occupation . , education captures parents ’ earning potential capacity transfer human capital children ( Chevalier et al. , 2013 ) . 20 ( 1 ) 𝑦𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑐𝑜ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 + 𝛽3𝑎𝑔𝑒1𝑠𝑡_𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙 + 𝛽4𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 ( 2 ) 𝑦𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑐𝑜ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 + 𝛽3𝑎𝑔𝑒1𝑠𝑡_𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙 + 𝛽4𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 + 𝛽5𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ( 3 ) 𝑦𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑐𝑜ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 + 𝛽3𝑎𝑔𝑒1𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙 + 𝛽4𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 + 𝛽6𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑑 ( 4 ) 𝑦𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦𝑐𝑜ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 + 𝛽3𝑎𝑔𝑒1𝑠𝑡_𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙 + 𝛽4𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 + 𝛽5𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝛽6𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑑 Caveat robustness check First , youth unemployment increased across cohorts , complexity ’ trends might driven multiple transitions employment unemployment well exposure unemployment beginning career – case younger cohorts Mediterranean welfare states . Therefore , robustness checks , also estimated models adjusting number months spent unemployment across seven-year individual sequences . However , matter fact , number months spent unemployment endogenous sequences . Due fact results robustness check highly consistent unadjusted model , focus latter results section . Second , regression analyses presented descriptive sense consider whether complexity early career trajectories changed cohorts workers exposed different phases labour market deregulation process . adopted analytical strategy allow us identify causal effect deregulation career complexity . macro-level dynamics might acted potential confounders association interest scenario increasing employers ’ demand flexibilization due globalization , widening 21 divide high-skilled low-skilled workers driven technological progress , expansion spectrum employment arrangements structural changes productive system associated growth service sector ( tertiarization ) – see Blossfeld et al . ( 2005 ) Esping-Andersen Regini ( 2000 ) . consider individual outcomes one specific point time ( e.g . year ) instead survey early career trajectories whole ( summarized complexity index built seven-year trajectories ) , indicator could use partially account macro-level dynamics unemployment rate . Specifically , robustness checks adjusted model : ( 1 ) average unemployment rates first seventh year labour market working-age population ( 2 ) population 15-24-year-olds ; ( 3 ) average unemployment rates first seventh year labour market female male working-age population ( 4 ) female male population 15-24-year-olds.11 effect average indicators specific time-span differs depending calendar year early career starts likely captured cohort-effect already . fact , expected , even controlling different unemployment rates , trend across cohorts persists similar sizes comparable significance main results presented . opted parsimonious models unadjusted unemployment rates averaged unemployment rates seven-year observational window attempted rough approximation unemployment ( macro indicator one might use ) dynamics . Results available upon request . 11 cohort 1974-1978 , unemployment rates averaged starting 1977 ISTAT-Italian National Statistical Institute provide historical series date back 1977 . 22 caveat regards comparison cohorts time , composition may changed . special concern respect women , female employment rates Italy steeply increased period studied here.12 Although adjust estimates observable individual characteristics ( i.e . education , geographical macro-area work , age time entry labour market , late entrance ) , empirically address fact results might affected changes time unobservable individual characteristics ( e.g . preferences leisure time specific employment arrangements , well need balance family job activities ) due data limitations , AD-SILC include information . particular , compositional effects terms unobservable characteristics might lead strong increase career complexity amongst women low-educated individuals . Despite limitations , dataset provide detailed descriptive evidence trends time early-career complexity heterogeneity according workers ’ gender socio-economic features . Finally , important point since aim compare early career complexity across several workers ’ cohorts 35-year time span , empirical quasi-experimental strategy infer causal links labour market reforms ( macro-level trends ) individual outcomes labour market would , first , force us abandon complexity index synthetic indicator longitudinal dynamics early career trajectories , second , compel us compare 12 According National Institute Statistics ( ISTAT ) data , 15–64 female employment rates increased 33.5 % 1977 49.6 % 2018 . 23 small number cohorts shorter period time.13 However , already highlighted , complexity index applied employment trajectories responds empirical fact raw data show workers ’ longitudinal experiences largely heterogeneous describe linear upward trajectories . would hardly impossible capture focusing specific ( traditionally studied ) ‘ point-in-time ’ outcomes ( e.g . unemployment spells transitions across contractual arrangements ) .

Raitano Fana [ 2019 ] Italy ) . 24 better illustrate meaning changes complexity across cohorts , Figure 2 shows distribution complexity index amongst workers according intervals computed respect value one standard deviations index total sample ( s.d.=0.074 ) . found share women whose early careers characterized complexity increased two standard deviations , 12.2 % 26.7 % across entry cohorts , share early career trajectories complexity equal 0 decreased 27.8 % 17.7 % . cases , differential pronounced two youngest cohorts . general trend also applied men , since men ’ early careers already relatively complex amongst older entry cohorts , increase complexity less pronounced : 25.6 % sample youngest cohorts displayed high complexity versus 19.4 % oldest , 23.3 % 27.4 % youngest oldest workers , respectively , experienced complexity equal 0 . [ Figure 2 ] descriptive results might confounded changes observable characteristics individuals across cohorts due educational expansion increasing women ’ labour market participation . Therefore , although analysis provide causal evidence link labour market deregulation early-career complexity , ran set OLS regression models estimate association complexity index entry cohort , adjusting observable individual characteristics . Table 3 displays results separate models men women . Support hypothesis 1 provided non-linear increase size complexity index across entry cohorts , shown estimated coefficients : baseline models M1 ( i.e . adjusted 25 workers ’ parents ’ education ) show recent cohorts men women experienced non-liner rise complexity . Substantiating hypothesis 3a rather hypothesis 2 , findings show men , early-career complexity significantly increased two youngest cohorts ( 1994–1997 1998–2001 ) compared 1974–1978 reference cohort . contrast , amongst women , early-career complexity started increase significantly entered labour market early 1980s . Changes complexity across cohorts remained significant adjusting workers ’ education ( models M2 Table 2 ) . expected , higher educational attainment associated lower complexity . Moreover , younger cohorts , average , educated older ones , size effects different cohorts increased adjusting education . adjusting socio-economic status proxied parental education instead workers ’ educational attainment ( models M3 Table 2 ) , found support persistent inequality hypothesis – advantageous family background associated lower early-career complexity men women.14 However , effect parental characteristics workers ’ early-career complexity almost fully explained better educational opportunities advantageous background . fact , adjusting workers ’ education , coefficient parental education longer statistically significant ( models 4 Table 4 ) . 14 Note , however , 75 % missing values parental education concerned youngest cohort ( 22 % missing values variable ) . fact , ad-hoc IT-SILC 2005 module ‘ Intergenerational transmission poverty ’ collects information applied least 25 years old 2005 . Thus , youngest cohort entered young age excluded models adjusted parental education . 26 [ Table 2 ] Figure 3 displays predicted values complexity index entry cohorts divided gender education . Overall , striking differences genders emerged considering comparison across cohorts within gender also levels complexity ( panels ( ) ) . average , older cohort men , i.e . 1974–1978 cohort , exhibited higher complexity values cohort women ( 0.079 versus 0.062 , respectively ) . crossover complexity observed men women across cohorts , women ’ early-career complexity increased much quicker rate across cohorts . 1984–1988 entry cohort women eventually reached complexity level men ( 0.081 0.082 , respectively ) , meaning early careers younger cohorts women displayed higher differentiation men , reaching highest value 0.121 cohort 1998-2001 . findings substantiate hypothesis 3a , namely higher early-career differentiation women across cohorts workers exposed increasing labour market deregulation . [ Figure 3 ] Figure 3 also shows predicted complexity education . Consistent hypothesis 3b , lower educated workers experienced higher degrees early-career complexity deregulation process proceeded compared upper secondary education . fact , men women tertiary education ( panels ( c ) ) , early-career complexity remained relatively low across cohorts , recent cohorts workers lower upper secondary education 27 displayed much higher complexity older cohorts . Yet , men , increase early-career variability non-linear , concerned two recent cohorts ( 1994–1997 1998– 2001 ) , , exposed late-1990s deregulation phase . Instead , dynamic across cohorts women followed ( non-linear ) inverse S-shape : complexity increased 1974– 1978 cohort 1979–1983 cohort stagnated , increase two youngest cohorts – 1994–1997 1998–2001 cohorts . findings therefore support hypothesis 3c , first , early-career complexity lower-educated women grew rapidly compared complexity low-educated men high-educated women , , second , complexity value highest 1998–2001 cohort low-educated women . Note present predicted probabilities gender , cohort , parental education none cohorts exhibited statistically significant differences complexity index workers high low parental education genders . Results available upon request . Additional evidence regarding number transitions states number months spent state seven-year-long observational window substantiates interpretation . Figure 4 shows increase complexity subsample women could partially explained decrease across cohorts share individuals never changed states . mainly affected women tertiary degree , whose early career trajectories characterized steady complexity values across cohorts . contrast , share men never changed states decreased upper secondary education . Therefore , complexity experienced newest entry cohort workers likely driven increasing transitions different states within labour market . recent cohorts highly educated men women experienced increase working time versus joblessness , early-career complexity 28 less influenced number episodes joblessness length . fact , number transitions increased across cohorts less educated individuals . Finally , increase early-career differentiation ( mostly low-educated ) women associated increase average number transitions different states experienced . proposed highly educated individuals may benefit increased availability temporary arrangements ( especially prestigious occupations ) . individuals may opt consciously lower-educated workers believe temporary arrangements offer different work experience improve chances upward career mobility ( De Jong et al. , 2009 ) . Although assess whether higher complexity early career trajectories result individual preferences , results indicate lower complexity individuals tertiary education changes across cohorts . sort strategic behaviour relevant , seem changed deregulation process , institutional structure began offer options flexible arrangements . considerations underpin interpretation high early-career complexity indicator uncertainty , unpredictability , , ultimately , precariousness . Discussion concluding remarks Labour market deregulation might generated less stable complex employment life courses . Exposure highly volatile early career trajectories long-lasting consequences course working life , especially contexts insurance-based welfare states make lifetime earnings dependent favourable entry labour market ( Chauvel Schröder 2014 ) . therefore especially important consider processes affect younger workers 29 countries like Italy , deregulation ‘ margins ’ labour market characterized notable age divide . article contrasted two approaches – individualization risk versus persistent inequality hypothesis – looking heterogeneity early-career complexity gender socio-economic status . considered workers entered labour market deregulation phase . adopting ‘ differential ’ life course sociology perspective , analyses looked one country case time highlight linkages institutional configurations employment outcomes . Instead relying cross-sectional indicators working statuses , compared seven-year-long early career trajectories six cohorts young workers experienced first employment episode 1974 2001 . used innovative longitudinal dataset built merging survey data administrative data working histories applied sequence analysis techniques calculate longitudinal employment life course variability operationalized complexity index captures stability mobility different spells employment labour market , accounting length recurrence . Even though analyses could test causal relations , allowed us display pace exposure labour market deregulation process associated longitudinal early-career differentiation . results support hypothesis 1 sense early-career complexity increased across cohorts deregulation process advanced . However , differences across gender socio-economic status . Specifically , line persistent inequality hypothesis , found gender differences pace increase complexity also levels ( hypothesis 3a ) : women ’ early-career differentiation grew faster greater extent men ’ . However , dynamic driven low- medium-educated individuals ( hypothesis 3b ) amongst youngest cohorts women displayed highest values early-career complexity ( hypothesis 3c ) . 30 additionally show effect parental background differentiation young people ’ labour market trajectories almost fully explained educational opportunities associated backgrounds . Drawing findings , argue inadequate employment conditions younger cohorts due fewer occupational opportunities – supposed increase number due labour market deregulation – resulted decline opportunities employment stability ( continuity ) long run . , increasing career complexity entry cohorts feature middle- low-educated workers rather high-educated ones , indicates rising skill divide amongst young people . likely result age cleavage differential exposure precariousness , context deregulation occurred ‘ margins ’ . Italian case telling respect flexibilization targeted young workers , result , became highly vulnerable unprotected employment . results speak insiders/outsiders literature , used indicator early-career complexity based individuals ’ longitudinal career trajectories hints exposure precariousness . therefore offers evidence labour market dualization terms sharp cohort divide resulting long-lasting cleavages labour market participation . addition limitations highlighted , hint prospects future work , able account one crucial dimension lack data . Specifically , could trace geographical mobility workers first job cohorts sample . might relevant given persistent North-South divide Italy , largely based differentials labour market opportunities still trigger massive migration South North . Moreover , specific focus sectors activity might suggest complementary explanations increasing early-career complexity . fact , trend towards service economy – characterized 31 wider spectrum jobs , usually , higher worker flexibility respect manufacturing – may favoured complex careers . Finally , future research address direct role life course events ( e.g . childbirth ) context underdeveloped care services ( Pacelli , Pasqua , Villosio 2013 ) role persistence traditional gender roles labour- market participation ( Grunow , Begall , Buchler 2018 ) . Notwithstanding limitations , results represent important point departure extending analysis countries experienced similar patterns institutional change . Moreover , findings relevant future analyses aftermath economic crisis 2008 early career trajectories : frequent layoffs temporary workers frequent joblessness generated higher complexity , severely negative consequences future incomes pensions . also erode career opportunities due weakening human capital increasing skill mismatches . 32 References Abbott , . 1995 . “ Sequence Analysis : New Methods Old Ideas. ” Annual Review Sociology 21 ( 1 ) : 93 –113 .
