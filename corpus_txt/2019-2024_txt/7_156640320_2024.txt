Yet , proven strictto provide insights deep economic downturns [ Kirman , 1992 , Farmer Foley,2009 , Stiglitz , 2018 ] . Eventually , neoclassical models might prove little help inaddressing society ’ pressing issues.2Complexity economics , investigates economy complex systems ’ lenses , offers alternative [ Arthur , 1999 , Bouchaud , 2008 , Farmer Foley , 2009 , Farmer , 2012 , Haldane Turrell , 2018 , Bouchaud , 2021 ] . Instead trying makethe economy fit Procrustean boundaries neoclassical assumptions , com-plexity economics starts agents actually behave focuses understand-ing emergent collective behaviour generate , either analytical the-ories computer simulations [ Farmer Foley , 2009 , Axtell Farmer,2022 ] . Thanks recent abundance computational resources , simulationscan run large scale , producing synthetic copies economy researcherscould use test policies make forecasts.This approach , however , devoid challenges . faithful copy econ-omy requires getting lot details right . Synthetic agents initialized tomatch real-world heterogeneity . behaviour truthful . inter-actions accurate.Unfortunately , always possible collect data needed calibra-tion , sometimes agents ’ properties , behaviours , interactions must inferred.Part thesis ( Chapters 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) focuses inferring modelling howfirms interact production networks , i.e. , networks firms tied commer-cial relationships .

Whilefirm-centric industry-specific studies important gathering insightsinto network features shape operation supply chains , remains hard togeneralize findings.Due challenges , production networks perfect use case net-work reconstruction .

Besides , I-Otables provide meso-scale ground truth could good target reconstructionmethods.With mind , expect global firm-level supply network looklike , much know ? Pichler et al . recently produced estimate size global firm-levelsupply network . start estimate three hundred million firms inthe world , ( domestic-only ) supply networks full data available , average forty suppliers per firm . Thus , rough estimate , full , globalfirm-level supply network could 300 million nodes 13 billion links.Bacilieri et al . provides taxonomy existing datasets covering network ; mainly commercial datasets confidential datasets held governments , pay-ment data , industry-specific datasets.Purchasing data data providers , FactSet , Capital IQ , Bloomberg isrelatively straightforward , commercial datasets expensive , coveronly fraction firms , small fraction links , usually include thevalue transactions . commercial data providers typically assemble datafrom publicly available information , researchers may also decide collect infor-mation . example extraction data World Wide Web , machine learning algorithms trained predict supply-buy relation-ships [ Wichmann et al. , 2020 ] . approach enables researchers successfully12gather rudimentary maps supply chains , although limited publicly availabledata , hence necessitating reconstruction efforts identify missing relationships.The option using government-held data necessitates datasets shared bynational authorities , may always feasible . However , data beencollected national authority usually high quality . example , VATreporting may contain value transactions timestamped data vir-tually firms within country . Bacilieri et al . shows VAT datasets noreporting thresholds exhibit strikingly similar properties , incomplete datasets ( either reporting threshold assembled publiclyavailable information ) usually fewer links many key statistics likelyto highly biased.A third option payment data , usually ( always ) limited indi-vidual banks collecting payment flow data client firm ( see , e.g. , Ialongoet al. ) . Although guaranteed every transaction corresponds businesslink within supply network , viewed plausible indicator . datasetsare extremely detailed subset firms affiliated bank . However , cover firms served different banks accounts held clients indifferent institutions.Finally , datasets focusing specific industry verticals also sometimes gath-ered private companies ( e.g. , MarkLines ’ automotive dataset used Brintrup et al .

However , usually limited tospecific geographies production sectors.There large-scale publicly available datasets firm-level production net-works , making impossible moment portray global supply network.Summing number nodes datasets reported Bacilieri et al .

Equipped probability distribu-tion , researchers find typical likely realizations network andcompute , instance , expected values confidence intervals properties thenetwork.1.1.3 Evaluating reconstructed networksIn review paper network reconstruction , Squartini et al . provide usefultaxonomy performance metrics : statistical , topological , dynamical indicators.Statistical indicators evaluate quality reconstructed network link-by-link ( weight-by-weight ) basis . Different statistical indicators apply deterministicand probabilistic outcomes.In realm deterministic outcomes , perhaps commonly employedindicator accuracy ( precision , proportion correct predictions . supply15networks , however , strong class imbalance : number pairs linkedis much higher number pairs linked . Thus , generally easy make “ correct ” predictions since predicting link exist likely cor-rect . reason , commonly used metric F1-score , defined harmonicmean precision recall ( many relevant items selected ) , offers amore balanced performance metric unbalanced datasets.For probabilistic reconstructions , evaluation often based area underthe receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUROC ) area precision-recallcurve . AUROC , derived Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve , es-sentially quantifies models ’ ability discern classes varying thresholdlevels . ROC curve plots true positive rate ( recall ) false positiverate different decision thresholds ( i.e. , considering “ true ” predictionswith probability larger certain threshold τ , different values τ ) , givinginsights trade-off sensitivity ( true positive rate ) specificity ( truenegative rate ) . AUROC , area curve , ranges 0.5 1 , with1 implying ideal classifier 0.5 suggesting better random guessing . SeeSec . 2.2.2 longer description ROC curves.While statistical indicators focus individual links , may adequatelyevaluate reconstructed network replicates complex network structures . Topolog-ical indicators measure well network ’ macro-level meso-level featuresare reproduced . Topological indicators gauge effectively reconstruction cap-tures network ’ ‘ coarse-grained ’ features . instance , Ialongo et al. , validate theirreconstruction methodology assessing accurately replicates network ’ sdegree distribution.Topological indicators tell us whether reconstructed true networks “ similar ” . However , ultimately key question whether reconstructed network isgood enough give good answers substantive economic questions . Dynamical ( ormore generally model-based ) indicators assess similarity process ’ evolutionon real reconstructed networks . example , Diem et al . introduced theEconomic Systemic Risk Index ( ESRI ) quantify firm ’ importance within econ-omy . metric measures percentage drop economy ’ overall productioncaused removal firm network . computation requires running adynamical process , wherein sudden disappearance firm first impacts sup-pliers customers , iteratively , spreads firms network , system reaches equilibrium . Conceivably , accurately estimating firms ’ 16ESRI may necessitate identifying subset key links serving primary con-tagion channels , implying majority links network ’ higher-orderfeatures may less bearing results.1.2 Network reconstruction techniquesNetwork reconstruction multidisciplinary pursuit , various methodologiesdeveloped across natural social sciences . saw , two common ap-proaches network reconstruction problem : link prediction , link inthe network predicted independently , network inference , whole net-work inferred . previous section , explained “ hard ” boundary two methods . However , useful classificationscheme organize techniques going review.1.2.1 Link PredictionLink prediction involves assigning score possible link , assuming suchscore proxies probability link exists . calculate scores basedon network ’ structure ( assuming know least part network ) , nodes ’ links ’ attributes , both.Scores derived network ’ structure known structural similarity scores.In 2011 review , Lü Zhou delineated common structural similarityscores used link prediction , dividing local , quasi-local , global scores.To compute local similarity scores link ( , j ) , need know neigh-bours two nodes B ( see Tab . A.1 , Appendix A.1 ) . compute quasi-localsimilarity scores , need know neighbours network distance greater one.Finally , global similarity scores require knowledge entire network.4The design local , quasi-local , global structural similarity scores wasoriginally performed manually , based researchers ’ intuition domain expertise.More recently , Graph Neural Networks ( GNN ) [ Bronstein et al. , 2017 , Hamilton , 2020 ] , class neural network models specifically engineered dealing graph data , used leverage network structure without need explicitly de-signing scoring algorithm [ Zhang , 2022 ] . GNN-based link prediction primarilyfollows two paradigms : node-based subgraph-based . node-based approach4For ‘ entire network ’ mean whole observed network . methods used identifyexisting unobserved links network predict appearance links future butare suited reconstruct network ‘ scratch ’ link observed.17first learns node representation GNN , aggregates pairwise node rep-resentations link representations prediction . Subgraph-based methods firstextract local subgraph around target link , apply graph-level GNN toeach subgraph , learning subgraph representation , used target linkrepresentation prediction.Structural similarity scores collectively used predictors moretraditional supervised-learning setting [ Ghasemian et al. , 2020 ] .Other approaches link prediction require explicit modelling ascore based network embedding . Network embedding [ Cui et al. , 2019 ] methods learn low-dimensional representations ( i.e. , embeddings ) nodes . Theseembeddings aim preserve structure network positioning connectednodes close one another latent space . distance nodes latent spacecan used score link prediction . famous example Node2Vec [ Grover Leskovec , 2016 ] algorithm.However , structural scores face cold start problem . new node joinsthe network , methods may struggle predict links accurately due lackor limited number existing links nodes . problem exacerbatedwhen observe set nodes , ’ observe link network.Content-Based methods [ Zhang , 2022 ] helpful situations . Content-basedmethods leverage explicit nodes ’ features link prediction . see Chap-ter 2 , methods successfully applied predict links productionnetworks.51.2.2 Network inferenceA second set approaches tries reconstruct entire network . Broadlyspeaking , approaches either compute probability distribution set ofpossible networks produce network optimal sense . completesurvey methods beyond scope section , reviewa relevant production networks.A first approach rooted statistical physics based maximum-entropyprinciple [ Jaynes , 1957 , 1982 , Cover Thomas , 2005 ] . maximum-entropy mod-els , also known Exponential Random Graph models , probability graph G,5Structural content-based methods combined .

Therefore , traininga model entire set available examples might simply computationally in-tractable ( ∼ n2 pairs ) . Moreover , sampling random subset would usuallylead poor predictions , scarce number positive examples hinders themodel ’ ability effectively discriminate two classes . phenomenon , known class imbalance problem , potentially lead models biasedtoward predicting majority class , thus failing accurately identify existinglinks.This problem commonly addressed applying undersampling ( Fig . 1.1B ) , tech-nique aims rebalance class distribution . context production net-works , undersampling involves carefully curating training set ensure pre-determined ratio positive ( Aij = 1 ) negative ( Aij = 0 ) examples .
