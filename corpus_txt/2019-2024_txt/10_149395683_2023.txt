Secondly , weexplore climate change integrated neoclassical growth models , including proposals incorporate externalities caused greenhouse gas emis-sions , ESG investing framework . However , one major weakness thisframework lack quality information corporate behavior regarding thisissue . Throughout chapter , highlight potential interdisciplinary ap-proaches using complex networks data science bridge existinggaps field economics.2The Haywain Triptych , central panel . Hieronymus Bosch.31.1 . Challenges present consumption main indicator societal well-beingThe word economics comes Greek words oικoς [ oikos ] , meaning `` fam-ily , household , estate , '' νoµoς [ nomos ] , `` custom , law , '' hence literallymeans management household . Perhaps modern definition wouldbe branch social sciences studies production , distribution , con-sumption goods services.The mainstream neoclassical economic thought considers living standards tobe equivalent number goods services consumed [ 1 ] . According tothe Friedman doctrine , businesses responsible utilizing resourcesand engaging activities aimed increasing profits [ 2 ] . responsibilityapplies long operate fair open competition without resortingto deceit fraud . Based premise , economic theory developedemphasizing number goods services produced consumed theprimary magnitude study ( i.e . accounting approach ) . instance , macroe-conomics focused explaining total value final goods servicesproduced , also known Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .However , essential note increased consumption alwaystranslate improved health standards , life expectancy , social equality , economicstability , factors contributing overall well-being . question thatarises measure enhance societal well-being beyond consump-tion maximization . Investors , policymakers , consumers influence com-panies differently achieve better societal outcomes . Investors might allocatecapital companies aligning better preferences . Policymakers reg-ulate ( incentivize ) companies deviate ( align ) desired behaviors.And consumers shift demand toward companies align better withtheir values . cases , complete information decision athand crucial.Numerous efforts made improve neoclassical economic frame-work aspect . fact , Nobel Prize Economics 2018 recognized thedesign models long-term development global economy thewelfare citizens , particular emphasis climate change . Paul M.Romer contributed goal providing tools comprehend relationship4between future long-term economic growth society ’ technological capabili-ties [ 3–5 ] . Meanwhile , William D. Nordhaus developed framework explainsthe interdependence economy planet ’ climate [ 6 ] . twocontributions cornerstones work.On one hand , explore above-mentioned relationship be-tween economic performance technological capabilities . Since GDP onlycharacterizes present economic performance , need indicators understandthe growth well-being future [ 7 ] . discussed Section 1.2 , en-dogenous growth literature points technology innovation ultimatesources economic growth . However , factors still remain hard measureusing classical methodologies . work , build Economic Com-plexity theory productive knowledge examine propagation across theglobe . leverage complex network science study mobility ofproductive knowledge interconnected global economy impacton economic performance.On hand , acknowledge present subjective well-being sig-nificantly influenced non-material factors [ 8 , 9 ] . Likewise , societal well-beingencompasses several indicators beyond material living standards [ 10 ] , in-cluding environmental aspects ( e.g. , global warming , biodiversity , land degrada-tion , water usage , toxic waste ) , social factors ( e.g. , inequality , access healthcareand education , social capital , labor conditions ) , governance matters ( e.g. , thejustice system , security , corruption , human rights ) . Various alternative indica-tors GDP suggested literature , Human Develop-ment Index , Genuine Progress Indicator ( GPI ) , Subjective Well-Being ( SWB ) [ 11 ] . However , indicators computed national level anddon ’ provide framework anybody policymakers take action.Investors consumers also exercise influence companies achieve bet-ter societal outcomes . explained Section 1.3 , still lack quality gran-ularity underlying information needed calculate crucial indi-cators . explain , work focuses environmental aspect , demonstrating statistical inference , machine learning , economic networkdata assist filling corporate emissions information gap provide qualityindicators.51.2 . Explaining long-run economic growthThe first piece work focuses studying productive knowledge mainsource economic growth . section 1.2.1 provide overview endoge-nous growth models main prediction : apart population dynamics , economic growth mainly driven productive capabilities society , whichare mainly determined technological progress . section 1.2.2 describehow recent developments Economic Complexity link productive knowl-edge held societies structure bi-partite network products andcountries . section 1.2.3 reveal first research question study : howwe build indicators productive knowledge mobility global economicnetwork process impacts economic output productivity in-creases.1.2.1 .

IntroductionFrom seminal work Solow [ 14 ] , economic output understood amonotonically increasing function factors production—land , labor , andcapital—plus additional term called Total Factor Productivity ( TFP ) accountfor additional unknown factors . Although TFP found keydeterminant long-run growth rate ( per worker ) [ 15 ] , drivers remain un-clear.From exogenous TFP models Solow [ 14 ] , endogenous growthmodels [ 3 , 18 ] addressed exogeneity assumption linking TFP innova-tion , education , regulatory environment , public goods , institutions . thesehuman capital factors enter scene determinants productivity , inturn explains long-run growth [ 114–116 ] .On one hand , long-term determinants like trade integration , ge-ography [ 117 ] institutions [ 118–121 ] . fact , literature identifies afriendly economic environment policies factors leading higher firm eco-nomic performance positive effect TFP [ 122 ] , financialopenness leads TFP growth [ 123 , 124 ] . hand , medium-term determinants like knowledge creation , transmission absorption , compe-tition , factors ’ supply , efficient allocation . Although recognize re-lationship long-term medium-term determinants strong , workfocuses medium-term determinants , specifically pertains knowl-edge factor supply.Knowledge shape innovation plays key role [ 125 ] TFP . Thechannels innovation takes place several . Besides knowledgecreation , occurs domestic foreign Research Developmentinvestments , two channels : knowledge transmission absorp-tion . Knowledge transfers imported . instance , goods embody techno-logical know-how . Therefore , trade connections among countries spur suchtransmission know-how ; importing relatively advanced goods potentiallyincrease stock knowledge [ 126 ] . Another channel Foreign Direct In-vestments ( FDI ) , theoretically brings knowledge country [ 127–131 ] .26In summary , could argue open economies could better positionedto acquire knowledge abroad.Regarding factor supply , knowledge transfer may inhibited lack ofabsorptive capacity . Nonetheless , country ’ absorption capacity strength-ened reception skilled migrants [ 132–137 ] . additionally beenshown migration per se positive effects productivity growthof destination countries regardless level education [ 138–140 ] .Interestingly , many elements rely fact two main factorsof production—labor capital—flow across globe global supplychains international migration networks respectively . trade side , tra-ditional economics reveals export diversification products leads growth [ 141 ] , especially developing countries [ 142 , 143 ] . migration side , stud-ies found macroeconomic fiscal consequences internationalmigration positive growth OECD countries [ 144 ] , informa-tion contained bilateral migration stocks suggests migration diversity apositive impact real GDP [ 132 ] . effect believed related factthat probability emigrating higher individuals higher human cap-ital [ 145 ] .
