J.E.L . Q30 , Q37 Keywords : Mining Competitiveness , Economic Complexity , Critical minerals , Energy transition . 2 . Motivation wide consensus increasing demand minerals direct consequence current energy transition . instance , International Energy Agency ( IEA ) noted meeting Paris Agreement limit global temperature increase `` well 2°C '' would require fourfold surge demand minerals used clean energy technologies 2040 ( International Energy Agency , 2021 ) . Similarly , International Monetary Fund estimates value metal production would increase fourfold 2040 , explained quantity price effects ( International Monetary Fund , 2021 ) . increasing demand minerals explained higher consumption intensity minerals new technologies compared incumbent technologies . amounts stating clean energy technology paradigm intensive minerals use fossil fuel paradigm . Moreover , low-carbon technologies require significantly larger quantities minerals also , broader range ( Bazilian , 2018 ) . example , wind power plant requires nine times minerals gas plant , electric car needs six times minerals traditional gasoline-powered car . Likewise , wind plant electric car use seven different types minerals , meanwhile gas plant conventional car use two ( World Bank Group , 2020 ; International Energy Agency , 2021 ) . Consequently , supply chains clean energy technologies complex fossil fuel technologies , disruption risks become central issue . vein , minerals employed new technologies become critical input energy transition ( Islam , Sohag , & Mariev , 2023 ) , thus , adoption speed low-carbon technologies largely depends secure mineral supply chains . Thereby , clear trade-off energy sustainability energy security emerging , minerals center tensions . Thus far , trade-off mainly faced developed countries pursuing techno-economic transition , revealed Critical Raw Material Act European Union ( European Commission , 2023 ) Inflation Reduction Act United States America ( Bistline , Mehrotra , & Wolfram , 2023 ) . However , mineral-producing countries , mostly emerging countries , experience trade-off different nature . one hand , incentives maximize mineral exports minerals boom ; exploit Ricardian rents related price quantity effects . hand , given short-term rigidities supply minerals , also face incentive exploit bargaining power add value minerals exporting processed goods stop ( slow ) exporting raw materials . Developing countries addressed trade-off different strategies . instance , Indonesia established ban nickel ore exports 2019 foster national smelter refinery industry ( Widiatedja , 2021 ) . Bolivia established law lithium industry 3 developed State , private entrepreneurs may participate joint ventures focused manufacturing lithium ( Obaya , 2020 ) . result , behavior strategy different countries , driven different incentives , affect “ critical ” nature minerals competitiveness different countries : criticality competitiveness become two crucial variables energy transition . words , achieving energy transition goals , e.g . carbon neutrality net zero economies , implies affordable mineral prices secure supply chains critical minerals . transition could reached absence . context , present paper proposes data-driven method economic complexity techniques measure minerals ' criticality countries ' mining competitiveness . Specifically , develop unsupervised algorithm based countries ’ specialization raw minerals exports , employs diversity ubiquity critical minerals exports . obtain two vectors : Mining Fitness Index ( MFI ) , accounting countries mining competitiveness , Criticality Minerals Index ( CMI ) , accounting extent minerals criticality . best knowledge , thus far study yielded together dimensions empirically , using economic complexity tools . one hand , diversity positively accounts mining countries ’ competitiveness , since reduces inherent substitution risk minerals uses . , diversified country , resilient technological changes may potentially substitute ( current ) minerals . hand , ubiquity negatively accounts criticality minerals since ubiquitous mineral implies countries able competitively export . Thus , mineral production ubiquitous , closer condition perfect competition , lower Ricardian rents . calculate Fitness- Criticality algorithm ( FCa ) , non-linearly combines vectors Mining Fitness Index Critical Minerals Index . paper structured follows . Section II reviews literature mining competitiveness critical minerals . Section III introduces economic complexity framework Fitness-Criticality algorithm ( FCa ) . , data methodology described Section IV , Section V show results FCa check temporal consistency two different windows time . Section VI summarizes concluding remarks . II . Literature Review section summarizes existent theoretical empirical studies conducted mining competitiveness critical minerals , set analytical framework use discuss state art topics . 4 Mining Competitiveness traditional literature mining competitiveness states countries competitiveness function high quality – low cost mineral deposits ( Tilton , 1992 ) . view related neoclassical international trade theory comparative advantages defined countries ’ factor endowments ( Heckscher , 1991 ; Ohlin , 1933 ) . Therefore , inter-country gaps exports export shares would exclusively obey minerals endowments . Later , literature developed along alternative routes state mineral endowments relevant , determinants competitiveness . variables institutional framework , infrastructure , tax burden , energy costs , regulatory framework , among , also matter . Indeed , even minerals endowment mineral reserves largely determines current production , move downstream along supply chain role reserves becomes going weaker factors begin matter ( Tilton , 1983 , 1992 ) . One straightforward method measure countries ' mining competitiveness market share , commodities mainly driven production costs . However , case need make considerations . First , market shares mining industry highly path dependent , given long lives mining operations high sunk capital . Therefore , even major changes competitiveness conditions mining leader country , market share would report short term . Secondly , market shares reflect natural competitiveness given endowments , labor , capital technology , also reveal policy distortions introduced regulations public policies . Thereby , countries clear comparative advantages , revealed minerals ’ endowments , necessarily competitive extracting minerals governments impose inappropriate regulations , excessive royalties permits compliances ( Tilton , 1992 ) . Taking account previous considerations , empirical literature mining competitiveness opted measures use foreign direct investment ( FDI ) allocated exploration country ( Jara , Lagos , & Tilton , 2008 ; Jara , 2017 ; Vasquez & Prialé , 2021 ) .1 argument approach assumes lagged reserves explain current production largely . Therefore , future production market share depend new reserves , turn depend investments allocated exploration . Furthermore , given investments sensitive institutional macroeconomic contexts , automatically capture variations variables . Nevertheless , studies performed cross-sectional econometric analyses time series , losing part attractiveness . sum , empirical studies model competitiveness function minerals endowments investment climate . exploration budget country taken 1 Interestingly , focus almost exclusively foreign investments , upon implicit assumption play much larger role domestic investments exploration . 5 proxy mining competitiveness ( dependent variable ) , land area countries market share used proxy geological endowment countries ( independent variable ) Index Economic Freedom2 Governance Index World Bank proxies mining investment climate ( independent variables ) . results studies support view mining competitiveness highlights role institutional variables explaining competitiveness . Critical Minerals unanimity literature definition critical minerals ( McNulty & Jowitt , 2021 ) conceptualizations consider country-specificities . Among many attempts define minerals , one proposed United States Government Energy Act 2020 stands , based three main characteristics : critical mineral essential economic national security country ; input manufacturing key intermediate goods economy national security , supply chain vulnerable disruptions3 . Moreover , recent literature review defined critical minerals “ valuable constituent element mineral commodity subject risk supply disruption serves purpose deemed important based evaluators ' perspective ” ( Hayes & McCullough , 2018 , p. 192 ) .4 Although critical minerals conceptualization dates back 1939 United States Strategy Critical Materials Stockpiling Act enacted WWII context , last decade new conceptualizations attached current energy transition . reason twofold : new technologies much higher minerals consumption intensity , boom clean technologies adoption expected ( Bazilian , 2018 ) . addition , several minerals produced non-competitive markets highly concentrated supply countries , many involved socio-geopolitical conflicts , introduces high risk supply disruptions endorses criticality denomination . instance , D.R Congo owns 70 % world supply cobalt China 60 % world supply rare earth . Supply disruptions easily overcome since mining projects require several years developed , makes supply inelastic short-medium term constitutes natural constraint diversifying sources minerals . Thus , minerals intensively used new clean technologies , photovoltaic panels , wind turbines , electric vehicles , power storage , considered critical minerals ( Islam , Sohag , & Mariev , 2023 ) . 2 https : //www.heritage.org/index/ranking accessed July 12 , 2023 . 3 information Energy Act 2020 : https : //www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr133/BILLS-116hr133enr.pdf 4 Yunxiong Li , Ascani , & Iammarino ( 2022 ) follow different approach define “ Rare Metals ” basis relevance modern technologies , text mining exercise 5,146,615 USPTO patents period 1976-2015 . 6 empirical literature critical minerals employed different methodologies , approaches agree considering minerals concentration disruptions risks supply chains two main determinants supply side . Meanwhile , economic importance appears main variable demand side ( Hayes & McCullough , 2018 ) . instance , European Union employs methodology based economic importance supply risk criteria . Minerals substitution possibilities main determinant economic importance , concentration , countries ' governance , trade restrictions supply chain bottlenecks main drivers supply risk ( European Commission Directorate-General Internal Market , Industry , Entrepreneurship SMEs Grohol , Veeh , C , 2023 ) . III . Economic Complexity Framework Fitness-Criticality Algorithm Economic complexity data-driven framework aims explain development countries employing network theory machine learning techniques big data ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2009 ; Caldarelli , et al. , 2012 ; Mealy , Farmer , & Teytelboym , 2019 ; Hidalgo C. , 2021 ; Balland , et al. , 2022 ) . economic complexity framework builds three cornerstones . First , ex-post agnostic approach replaces idea production function fed couple inputs . Instead , highly granular economic outputs ( e.g . exports , labor ) used infer unknown/hidden factors , domestic capabilities local productive knowledge , explain countries ’ economic performance . Second , employs network theory machine learning methods , matrix decomposition techniques , capture hidden features countries , thus , depict economic performance . Third , economic complexity computation based specialization matrixes ( RCAs , RTAs , etc . ) connects location ( i.e . country , region , etc . ) activities ( i.e . products , patents , etc . ) , derive countries ’ diversity products ’ ubiquity . Within economic complexity literature , diversity export specializations reflects variety hidden local capabilities/knowledge countries , whilst ubiquity goods across countries reveals products sophistication level . evidence shows developed countries export competitively wider range less common products , developing countries specialized scarce number common products . empirical fact linked nestedness property retrieved network structural patterns ( Mariani , Ren , Bascompte , & Tesso , 2019 ) widely adopted study location-activity networks . summary , economic complexity proposes framework relates locations activities , based observable outputs ( e.g . exports , labor ) . allows us capture useful insights countries – complexity fitness - products complexity sophistication - employing machine learning techniques . light characteristics , economic complexity framework offers suitable methodology depict relationship 7 countries ' mining competitiveness minerals ' criticality . provides framework connect countries products simultaneously infer features economic system . build Fitness-Criticality algorithm ( FCa ) follow non-linear algorithm proposed Tachella et al ( 2013 ) . , countries ' fitness result iterative process export specializations reached countries weightedly added using complexities respective products weights . turn , products ' complexity result iterative process product 's ubiquities ( inverses ) weightedly added using inverse countries ' fitness , non-linear relationship dimensions incorporated ( nestedness property ) . However , interpretation FCa totally different original algorithm mentioned authors since take straightforward interpretation countries ' diversity products ' ubiquity . sense , paper differs classic economic complexity view dismiss idea inferring local capabilities domestic knowledge international trade . perspective competitiveness , diversified portfolio critical minerals reduces demand substitution risks given inherent uncertainty ongoing technological races . balances risk given technological concentration minerals ( Markowitz , 1991 ) . Two sources demand substitution risk may singled . First , modification technology substituting one mineral another one produce clean technologies minimize costs . risk evident Li-ion batteries , different sub-technologies competing leading market proportion minerals employed represents different risks . instance , NMC battery uses 33.3 % Nickel , 33.3 % Manganese 33.3 % Cobalt , meanwhile , NMC811 battery uses 80 % Nickel , 10 % Manganese 10 % Cobalt ( World Bank Group , 2020 ) . Secondly , substitution one entire technology another one , producing lock-in minerals used obsolete technology . second risk identified less mature technologies , energy storage systems , technological race still initial stages , dominant technology yet . instance , new prototypes energy storage technologies replacing lithium–cobalt batteries salt batteries employing non ( less ) -critical minerals , sodium , nickel chloride ( Armand et al. , 2023 ) . perspective minerals ’ criticality , rents minerals differ according competition level mineral markets . Critical minerals supplied countries ( less ubiquitous minerals ) tend traded imperfectly competitive markets , means mineral price established markup marginal cost . case minerals Cobalt Rare Earths . Instead , price determined basis undisclosed contracts reduced numbers economic actors . Therefore , less ubiquitous minerals provide higher rents , since suppliers market power set price marginal costs . 8 Finally , nestedness property says countries exporting wider range critical minerals also able export critical ones . Differently original complexity/fitness index , property explained availability knowledge capabilities , state nestedness property mainly consequence geological formation since critical minerals byproducts major industrial minerals . Therefore , one country endowed copper iron high chances also produces cobalt , molybdenum , tellurium , rhenium , rare earths , niobium vanadium ( McNulty & Jowitt , 2021 ) . course , technology also plays role , since recovering byproducts requires specific technology specialized knowledge . regard , geological formation represents necessary condition technological level sufficient condition explain nestedness property country-critical mineral space . Figure 1 illustrates property triangular specialization matrix arises mining countries critical minerals . Figure 1 : Triangular specialization matrix ( 2008 – 2018 ) . Source : elaboration . Countries Y-axis critical minerals X-axis . triangular shape specialization matrix reflects diversified countries ( e.g. , country 1 ) also countries able competitively export less ubiquitous minerals ( e.g. , product 1 ) vice versa . conclusion , propose consider competitive mining countries face energy transition countries specialized producing wider variety critical minerals , among also less ubiquitous ones . words , countries maximize expected rents considering substitution risks . time , critical products fewer countries competitively export , countries diversified . IV . Data Methodology Countries ' mining competitiveness minerals ' criticality estimated based exclusively export data . Export flows taken COMTRADE database United Nations 9 harmonized period 1995 – 2018 . exports series , estimate revealed comparative advantages ( RCA ) every product-country pairwise last 23 years available . Thereby , dataset composed 23 matrixes containing 5040 products 147 observations ( countries ) . yearly matrices averaged two matrices , M1 = 1996 – 2007 M2 = 2008 – 2018 , compute algorithm two different time periods test consistency . calculating RCA products , defined sub sample critical minerals estimate criticality level . regard , adhere conceptualization critical minerals widely used clean technologies ( Bazilian , 2018 ; Islam , Sohag , & Mariev , 2023 ) . Specifically , rely previous studies carried International Energy Agency World Bank ( International Energy Agency , 2021 ; World Bank Group , 2020 ) select group 10 technologies main clean technologies 20 minerals5 “ critical ” minerals given use technologies . criterion selection technologies based expected deployment6 , whilst minerals selected according consumption intensity technology , range employment across technologies expected demand increment . Table 1 shows matrix relates technologies minerals . Table 1 . Critical Mineral list clean technologies Source : elaboration based ( World Bank Group , 2020 ) ( International Energy Agency , 2021 ) . selected critical minerals assessed , next step consisted identifying minerals within harmonized system international trade categories . Specifically , 5 minerals grouped since exports accounted HS code . 6 IEA scenarios . 10 made text analysis United Nations COMTRADE database , disaggregated six digits , searching name 20 minerals . , classified products containing minerals raw processed minerals . Given interest extractive industries rather metallurgic industries , selected products made raw minerals . Thereby , sample contains 46 products , mainly ores , ashes , residuals , powder , flakes and/or unwrought minerals.7 Specifically , sample contains : iron products ( 6 ) , zinc products ( 6 ) , aluminum products ( 5 ) , copper products ( 5 ) , nickel products ( 4 ) , molybdenum products ( 3 ) , lithium products ( 2 ) , graphite products ( 2 ) , chromium products ( 2 ) , silver products ( 1 ) , rare earths product ( 1 ) , cobalt product ( 1 ) , silicon product ( 1 ) , niobium product ( 1 ) , tantalum & vanadium product ( 1 ) , manganese product ( 1 ) , lead product ( 1 ) , ruthenium product ( 1 ) , osmium iridium product ( 1 ) , rhodium product ( 1 ) , palladium product ( 1 ) platinum product ( 1 ) .8 Finally , delete observations countries without relevant production critical mineral last two years compute Fitness-Criticality algorithm ( FCa ) . adjustment needed export data include re-exports , distort mining competitiveness , otherwise country without mining production could considered competitive . purpose , employ data United State Geological Service ( USGS ) allows us know main countries ' producers type mineral . Thereby , final database compute FCa consists two matrices 46 products ( critical minerals ) 50 countries ( mineral producers ) covering 23 years . Formally , FCa defined following system equations : 1 𝐹 𝑀 𝐶 2 𝐶1∑ 𝑀 1/𝐹 3 𝐹𝐹𝐹 4 𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝐹 fitness country𝑐 , 𝑀 country-product specialization matrix based RCA product 𝐶 criticality level product ( mineral ) 𝑝 . Thereby , Equation ( 1 ) computes country fitness specialization sum exporting critical minerals ( diversity ) weighted criticality level exported mineral one iteration back . 7 processed mineral included copper cathode . 8 See Annex , Table 1 information regarding products selected . 11 turn , Equation ( 2 ) computes minerals ' criticality level sum minerals ' ubiquity inverse weighted inverse fitness exporting country . way , criticality depends ubiquitous mineral , i.e. , many countries export competitively , also mining competitiveness exporters . non-linearity given mineral ubiquity normalization fitness exporting country , reflects countries higher mining competitiveness able produce export less ubiquitous critical minerals . Finally , Equations ( 3 ) ( 4 ) state fitness criticality values order n , vector normalized average value . V. Results Mining Fitness-Criticality algorithm ( FCa ) provides two vectors . one hand , Mining Fitness Index ( MFI ) assigns value country according diversity exported critical minerals type exported critical minerals ( i.e . less ubiquitous ) . Thus , MFI allows us approximate competitiveness mining countries producing critical minerals since captures minerals substitution risks extent competition faced . hand , Mining Criticality Index ( MCI ) assigns value critical mineral according ubiquity , inversely weighted mining fitness producer countries . sense , MCI captures common mineral , fact rarer minerals produced countries higher fitness . higher value lower ubiquity : mineral exported competitively small number countries . regard , high MCI implies mineral market far perfectly competitive conditions , hence , higher potential rents . worth mentioning assess minerals criticality consider factors supply side : many countries export competitively specialization . However , demand factors implicitly considered sample selection , based higher expected demand due energy transition estimated International Energy Association World Bank ( International Energy Agency , 2021 ; World Bank Group , 2020 ) . Figures 2 3 show estimated results algorithm period 2008-2018 . Figure 2 displays countries ordered Mining Fitness Index , measured deviations average fitness value . South Africa appears competitive country far , followed Russia United States . , Norway , Canada , Australia Chile emerge third group , Finland , China Brazil behind . opposite extreme , five least competitive countries Gabon , Ivory Coast , Rwanda , Mauritius , Ghana . 12 Figure 2 : Mining Fitness Index ( 2008-2018 ) Source : elaboration . Figure 3 : Minerals Criticality Index – Top 50 % ( 2008-2018 ) Source : elaboration . Figure 3 displays products ordered value Minerals Criticality Index , measured deviations average criticality value . platinum group metal ( PGM ) composed platinum ( Pt ) , palladium ( Pd ) , rhodium ( Rh ) , ruthenium ( Ru ) , osmium ( Os ) iridium ( Ir ) ) occupies first positions . main mineral platinum rest by-products . world reserves PGM concentrate five countries : South Africa 13 ( 90.1 % ) , Russia ( 6.4 % ) , Zimbabwe ( 1.7 % ) , United States ( 1.3 % ) Canada ( 0.4 % ) .9 Next criticality Lithium minerals , found brines rock . Lithium resources brines concentrated South America Argentina , Bolivia Chile , however , Argentina Chile relevant participation reserves production . Lithium reserves production rock ( pegmatites ) mainly concentrated Australia , representing 50 % world production . China also major player market 17 % 13 % Lithium production reserves respectively ( Economic Commission Latin-America Caribe , 2022 ) . results line provided methodologies separately estimate countries ’ mining competitiveness minerals ’ criticality . However , divergences explained variables used measure competitiveness criticality . instance , Fraser Institute Annual Surveys10 ask mining exploration companies perception regarding main factors affecting investment exploration . report dates 1997 ranks competitiveness countries districts/regions countries . ranking window time ( 1996-2018 ) partly different , regularities . United States , Canada Australia systematically lead rankings , countries Chile , Finland Sweden also among competitive , coherently ranking illustrated Figure 2 . Instead , countries like Venezuela , Bolivia , Argentina , D.R . Congo Indonesia appear often bottom , also coincides ranking , since ranked mean . Nevertheless , countries get opposite results . instance , India China rank mean ranking , Fraser Institute classify among least competitive . discrepancy may explained Fraser Institute focuses investment attractiveness , therefore biases analysis non-Western countries China , India Russia . Instead , MFI based RCAs countries exporting critical minerals , i.e. , accounts actual output produced country . Similarly , European Commission elaborated ranking minerals criticality countries based economic impact ( limited ) availability could EU economies supply risk mineral . Although report wider scope present research , since studies 70 possible critical minerals , minerals linked energy transition , represents good benchmark study . last version report ( European Commission Directorate-General Internal Market , Industry , Entrepreneurship SMEs Grohol , Veeh , C , 2023 ) , 34 70 minerals assessed considered critical . Within 34 minerals , 14 fall critical list . 6 minerals included list considered critical European Commission , means matching 70 % . assessments Platinum 9 https : //natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts/20520 accessed July 10 , 2023 . 10 https : //www.fraserinstitute.org/categories/mining accessed July 12 , 2023 . 14 Group Metals Rare Earths appear critical , meanwhile , copper , lead zinc appear least critical . estimate correlation Critical Minerals Index ( CMI ) , simple average economic importance index supply risk index reported European Commission ( EC-CRM ) , obtain positive linear correlation 0.57 ( Figure 4 ) . , also appreciate minerals appear critical one ranking one . minerals highlighted red outliers significant differences two estimates . instance , ruthenium , omnium iridium appear considerably critical assessment , meanwhile , cobalt emerges one critical based European Commission assessment . Figure 4 : European Commission Critical Raw Material Index ( EC-CRM ) versus Critical Minerals Index ( CMI ) Source : elaboration . also test MFI CMI indicators changed time , way test consistency Fitness-Criticality algorithm . Indeed , changes criticality level minerals countries competitiveness expected , rather limited since mining industry needs long periods time develop new projects . words , substantial path dependence expected mining competitiveness minerals criticality . purpose , execute algorithm two different periods , , run two linear regressions : 𝑀𝐹𝐼 versus 𝑀𝐹𝐼 𝐶𝑀𝐼 versus 𝐶𝑀𝐼 . expect high intertemporal correlation indexes due long-term nature mining activity . Moreover , outliers ’ observations offer interesting information countries deviating past trend relatively short period . explain deviation significant positive negative shocks shifting competitiveness trend . 15 Figure 5 shows linear relationship 𝑀𝐹𝐼 𝑀𝐹𝐼 , measured deviations regarding respective means . Pearson correlation MFIs reaches high level 0.92 , reflects high persistency . Countries regression line ( red dots ) countries performs better expected linear relationship , opposite applies countries regression line ( black dots ) . regard , South Africa country highest improvement 𝑀𝐹𝐼 periods . Although negative outliers , Russia , Australia , China , Uzbekistan Guinea appear countries losing mining fitness . Figure 5 : Mining Fitness Index time ( 1996-2007 vs. 2008-2018 ) Source : elaboration . replicate analysis minerals ' criticality measure criticality consistency time . Figure 6 illustrates linear relationship 𝐶𝑀𝐼 𝐶𝑀𝐼 , reaches 0.93 Pearson coefficient . Highly critical minerals first period remain highly critical second period , applies minerals low criticality level , remain little critical . red dots Figure 6 regression line show minerals significantly gained criticality , meanwhile , black dots illustrate minerals significantly lost criticality periods . Ruthenium , Osmium , Iridium Lithium increased criticality time . contrast , figure shows loss criticality Rare Earths , however still remain among top five critical minerals . Similarly , also nickel products lost criticality . 16 Figure 6 : Minerals Criticality Index time ( 1996-2007 vs. 2008-2018 ) Source : Elaborated based estimates . VI . Final Remarks Fitness-Criticality index contributes literature providing straightforward methodology assess countries ' mining competitiveness minerals ' criticality . results line methods employed past evaluate dimensions separately . However , mainstream methods take exploration investment proxy competitiveness ( indirect measure ) , employ revealed comparative advantages primary information source , i.e . direct measures competitiveness Moreover , existing analyses assess minerals ’ criticality based large set variables accounting economic importance countries regions supply chain risks mineral , exclusively use export data estimate countries ’ diversification minerals ’ ubiquity , two cornerstones algorithm . explains discrepancies index emerge , since perform ad-hoc demand-side analysis . sum , proposed indexes efficient terms quantity information needed , less influenced country-specific perspectives assessments rely widely available public statistical sources . results show South Africa , Russia , United States , Norway , Canada , Australia , Chile , Finland , China Brazil among top 10 competitive countries critical minerals industries , highest levels Mining Fitness Index . surprising find countries like United States , Canada Australia group . However , presence Russia China represents novelty relative indexes may explained use direct measure competitiveness instead indirect measure used mainstream literature , crucially hinges foreign direct investments exploration . Moreover , according Critical Minerals Index , 17 critical minerals Platinum Group Metals , Lithium , Silicon Rare Earths , pretty much line technical assessments preliminary policy insights gained analysis . Critical Minerals Index provides signal mineral producer countries strong bargaining power . regard , mining countries using industrial policies foster adding value resourced-based exports aware policy results would depend criticality extent minerals . instance , export ban copper ore Chile Peru , similar recent Indonesia 's export ban nickel ore , would probably successful since copper ore low criticality compared nickel , thereby enjoying limited market power . Indeed , copper fourth quartile Critical Mineral Index , meanwhile , nickel first one . hand , Fitness Mining Index shows polymetallic countries competitive countries specialized single minerals metals . Indeed , makes resilient substitution risks . However , higher competitiveness also due diversified countries able produce critical ( less ubiquitous ) minerals . Although capacity produce critical minerals largely determined geological formation - critical minerals byproducts major industrial minerals - , also relevant technological component associated capabilities countries recover valorize discarded byproducts .
