Introduction Sustainable development often defined process meeting human development goals simultaneously sustaining natural environment1–4 . approach implies development environment interdependent , economic growth sustained inclusive green5,6 . achieve sustainable development , countries need consider interconnections economic , social , environmental factors7–12 . multiplicity factors , however , hard quantify compare . Economic complexity methods provide solution problem13,14 . leveraging data geographic distribution economic activities , methods used 1 Corresponding author , e-mail : cesar.hidalgo @ univ-toulouse.fr 2 estimate implicit presence multiple economic factors , consequently , explain international variations economic growth15–24 , income inequality25–27 , emissions28–31 . Today , commonly used metrics complexity based trade data23,30,32 . Trade data , however , miss key information innovative activities , patent applications research publications could relevant geography inclusive green growth . example , research technology shape production processes , affecting skills compensation workers emission intensity industrial activities . Moreover , trade-based metrics complexity systematically underestimate complexity economies distant global markets , turn might distort predictions inclusive green growth33,34 . , complexity economies rich natural resource exports , distant markets , Australia , Chile , New Zealand , might better reflected ability produce outputs scientific research patentable innovations sophisticated exports . may true , reverse , manufacturing heavy economies deeply integrated neighbors ’ value chains , Mexico Czechia . countries complex tradeable product sector , show , comparatively less sophisticated research innovation sectors . recent literature economic complexity begun using data patents35 , employment36,37 , research papers38 , estimate complexity countries , cities , regions . metrics rarely combined work using complexity methods explain geography inclusive green growth39,40 . bridge gap , introduce multidimensional approach economic complexity combines data geography exports product , patents technology , scientific publications field research . use approach explain variations economic growth , income inequality , greenhouse emissions . would complexity economies explain geographic variation inclusive green growth ? Economic complexity metrics capture information productive structures escapes simple aggregate , GDP . Unlike GDP , sums value added regardless activities involved , economic complexity metrics capture information sophistication activities . Consider exports X-rays iron ore . contribution exports GDP equal 3 export value , contribution economic complexity quite different , since X-rays high complexity product ( pushing complexity economy ) iron ore . fact , according data Observatory Economic Complexity41 , X-rays product complexity 1.46 whereas iron ore product complexity -1.84 . Since complexity metrics related knowledge intensity economic activities , unit GDP generated production X-rays cleaner inclusive unit GDP generated iron ore mining . opportunity cost argument . Consider economies Switzerland , Singapore , Sweden . economies engage important part population relatively sophisticated activities ( high complexity economies ) . activities associated level emissions , ability contribute economic growth , affect way income distributed , complexity metrics capture contribution outcomes absolute terms . Instead , capture contribution relative activities . simple terms , capture idea , absence X-ray equipment production , engineers would involved mining . Thus , expect measures economic complexity help us explain variations macroeconomic outcomes effective capturing information economic structures . Also , expect methods benefit data multiple activities ( e.g . trade , patents , research ) . fact , find combination trade , patent , research publication data significantly robustly improves ability economic complexity methods explain inclusive green growth . particular , metrics trade technology complexity—but research complexity—combine explain international differences economic growth income inequality . addition , countries score high three metrics tend lower emission intensities . also find negative interaction trade technology complexity explaining growth , indicating information captured two metrics redundant ( hence metrics partly substitutes ) . However , find negative interaction explaining income inequality . Finally , comes emissions , find interaction terms dominate models , meaning countries lower emissions tend score high complexity metrics . results robust variety controls ( total exports , number patents , number publications , GDP per capita , etc . ) confirmed instrumental variable robustness check complexity country replaced average structurally similar neighbors . 4 findings expand knowledge role economic complexity inclusive green growth help open new avenue research explores combination multiple sources data create improved policies achieving sustainable development .

Multidimensional Economic Complexity Inclusive Green Growth Next , explore information provided technology research complexity combines trade complexity explain international variations future economic growth , income inequality , greenhouse gas emissions . investigate question piecemeal , first employing models include variable separately , , including variables together , finally , using interaction terms . addition , test robustness using instrumental variable approach several controls . follow literature15,30,32 set panel regressions form 𝑦 ! & = 𝑓 ; 𝐸𝐶𝐼 ! & ' < + 𝑎 ( 𝑋 ! & + 𝜇 & + 𝑏 ) + 𝑒 ! & , 𝑦 ! & dependent variable country 𝑐 year 𝑡 ( economic growth , income inequality , emission intensity ) , 𝑓 ; 𝐸𝐶𝐼 ! & ' < function three complexity indices ( = trade , technology , research ) , 𝑋 ! & vector control variables account key factors ( e.g . population , GDP per capita , etc . ) , 𝜇 & describes time-fixed effects account unobserved period-specific factors , 𝑏 ) intercept , 𝑒 ! & error term , ( see Supplementary Information ( SI ) Section 1 information data SI Section 2 regression specification ) . validate select separate “ multidimensional model ” growth , inequality , emission intensity using following criteria . First , multidimensional model must lead largest 9 significant increase explanatory power baseline model ( given coefficient determination 𝑅 * validated Wald F-test ) . baseline model includes GDP per capita ( square case inequality ) time-fixed effects . Second , multidimensional model included complexity coefficients ( individual interaction terms ) must statistically significant . Finally , require model pass two types robustness checks . First , check robustness exploring whether effects hold including additional explanatory variables . measures size ( population ) , human capital ( years education ) , dependence natural resources ( natural resource exports per capita ) , metrics intensity respective output ( exports per capita , patent applications per capita , number research documents per capita ) . also try alternative definitions complexity46,47 check whether results hold non-complexity metrics , measures market concentration ( Shannon information entropy Herfindahl–Hirschman index ( HHI ) ) ( see SI Sections 3.1 3.2 ) . call model significant robust explanatory variables “ final model. ” best model explaining variations economic growth , income inequality , emission intensity . Second , also use instrumental variable approach , complexity values replaced average complexities three similarly specialized countries . designed address possibility relationship inferred multidimensional final models economic complexity studied macroeconomic outcomes may endogenous local conditions lead higher complexity better outcomes . replacing complexity estimates average countries similar specialization patterns , decouple complexity estimates local conditions . Economic growth : Economies high levels complexity relative GDP per capita known experience faster long-term economic growth15–18,21,24,48–51 . idea higher complexity economies participate sophisticated sectors support higher wages . relationship repeatedly validated using trade15–17,51 employment data21,37 , lack research exploring whether technology research complexity play similar role . test effect trade , technology , research complexity economic growth looking 10-year annualized GDP per capita growth ( constant PPP dollars ) using two periods 1999-2009 2009-2019 . baseline model includes log initial GDP per capita ( constant 10 PPP dollars ) time fixed-effects ( see SI Section 4.1 ) . captures Solow ’ idea economic convergence52 ( baseline model presented column 1 table 1 , 𝑅 * = 0.26 ) . Table 1 shows effect three complexity metrics interactions . find trade complexity significant positive predictor economic growth ( column 2 , 𝑅 * = 0.36 ) technological complexity similar explanatory power ( column 3 , 𝑅 * = 0.34 ) .

Also , F-statistics imply coefficients trade technology ECI remain significant even including log population log human capital . addition , multidimensional model clearly outperforms similar models based production intensity , measures diversification , measures complexity . Trade technology ECIs also outperform measures concentration ( entropy Herfindahl-Hirschman ) . final model includes multidimensional ECI ( trade , technology , interaction ) , Solow term ( GDP per capita ) , log human capital , log natural resource exports per capita ( see SI Section 4.3 ) . 11 Table 1 .

Discussion Economic complexity methods become important tools explain regional international variations inclusive green growth57–64 . Yet , applied work economic complexity relies metrics derived trade data limited ability capture information non-trade activities . lead distorted estimates complexity certain countries limited 18 information different types activities combine explain variations inclusive green growth . , combined trade , technology , research data , explore role complexity metrics inclusive green growth . found technology complexity adds ability trade complexity explain economic growth income inequality , trade , technology , research complexity complement ability explain greenhouse gas emissions . also found complexities expressed different forms activities sometimes interact . Trade technology complexities partly substitutes growth regression , inequality model . Moreover , emission intensities model highest predictive power obtained model triple interaction , meaning lower emission intensities correlate countries score high three metrics complexity . results mean ? one hand , product exports patent applications easily tied monetary outcomes economic growth income inequality ( e.g. , product exports generate revenues , whereas patents generate royalties ) . Thus , structure activities contribute directly monetary outcomes , unlike geography research papers may indirect effect . Emission intensities , hand , seem correlate negatively presence complexity trade , technology , research , suggesting countries lower emissions sophisticated across three dimensions . instance , Australia ’ high emission intensity explained lack sophistication exports65 . Yet , also expect Australia ’ emission intensity relatively low compared countries similar export structure , Australia ’ high complexity technology research . results relevant identifying strategic areas economic diversification development , provide holistic target one provided metrics trade complexity alone30,32 . interest policy makers using complexity metrics inclusive green development reinforce idea metrics economic complexity go beyond measures trade sophistication33,34,62,66,67 . fact , results show combination multiple metrics 19 complexity key extract information role economic structures inclusive green growth . Yet , approach without limitations . First , patent application research publication data also limitations . instance , since patent applications research documents usually written English , datasets favor , English speaking countries ( e.g. , USA , Australia ) countries high proficiency English ( e.g. , Netherlands , Sweden ) . Second , plenty activities captured either trade , patent , research publication data—such services , digital products , cultural activities . may capture additional aspects complexity economies would need included comprehensive multidimensional framework16,68,69 . Unfortunately , current state art include internationally comparable fine-grained datasets additional activities ( e.g . service trade data aggregate approximate productive structure economy , see Ref.70 SI Section 8 ) . Third , research also limited differences granularity three datasets : trade data granular , 1,200 unique products , research publication data involves 300 subject categories . may one reasons see strong effects research complexity economic growth income inequality , one reasons combining datasets unified matrix ( e.g. , concatenating multiplying matrices ) non-trivial . Fourth , results readily generalized geographic scales , states provinces . instance , future economic growth shown correlate complexity countries15,17,20,51,64 regions70 , relationship complexity inequality known reverse regional scale21,71–74 . Thus , approach tell us much regional effects , could different observed international scale21,72–75 . Yet , despite limitations , multidimensional complexity improves upon state-of-the-art explaining international differences economic growth , income inequality , greenhouse gas emissions . findings advance understanding role economic complexity inclusive 20 green growth motivate new research comprehensive metrics complexity sustainable development .
