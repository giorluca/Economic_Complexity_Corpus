Introduction Recent studies show financial market promotes economic performance ( Levine , 1997 ; Chang et al. , 2014 ; Olayungbo & Akinlo , 2016 ; Din , Abu-Bakar & Regupathi , 2017 ) , large extent , economic complexity ( Chu , 2020 ; Nguyen et al. , 2020 ; Nguyen & Su , 2021 ) . studies argue importance financial sector key driver economic complexity ( Nguyen & Su , 2021 ) . Traditional line thought suggests well-developed financial sector lowers transaction costs , eases credit constraints serves conduit adequate resources productive investment garnered ( Levine , 1999 ) . However , notion generated lot inconclusive submissions . surprising majority empirical studies employ gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita GDP proxy economic performance . lack conclusion might due variable measurement used proxy economic performance . , new evidence established use economic complexity measure economic performance appropriate . Unlike GDP , economic complexity considers economic component , also social productive structure economic system ( Gomez-Zaldivar et al. , 2022 ; Ajide , 2022 ) . components found instrumental determining economic progress , especially current era globalization ( Ojeyinka & Osinubi , 2020 ) . Besides , economic complexity broader scope economic growth be-cause incorporates aspects production competency , knowledge advancement critical achieving economic emancipation ( Hausmann et al. , 2019 ) . Thus , present study employs economic complexity broad better measure economic performance . Economic complexity country ’ ability diversify production export traditional simple products better , improved , sophisticated products . diversified productive base economy , wider export structure complex economy . literature , economic complexity used gauge production export structure countries ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2009 ; Erkan & Yildirimci , 2015 ; Mastilo , 2015 ) . represents accumulation knowledge technology country manufacturing products exports . vein , amount knowledge available economy serves key determi-nant future performance economy ( Albeaik et al , 2017 ; Ajide & Osinu-bi , 2023 ) . Economic complexity adjudged best indicator economic progress based emphasis knowledge , skill , product diversity ubiquity ( Ferrarini & Scramozzino , 2016 ; Dogan et at. , 2020 ) . Despite perceived role financial system driving economic performance , limited studies examined financial development–economic complexity nexus focus role banking stock market proxy financial de-velopment ( Chu , 2020 ) . neglect role insurance sector economic complexity necessitated study . Therefore , main objective study 538ISSN 2029-4581 eISSN 2345-0037 Organizations Markets Emerging Economiesexamine impact insurance sector economic complexity selected OECD countries . noted Chen et al . ( 2012 ) Din et al . ( 2017 ) , insurance sector significant role play upgrading national economic complexity . Figure 1 contains information share insurance economic complexity se-lected OECD countries . Inference Figure 1 reveals positive association economic complexity insurance sector OECD countries . implies countries developed insurance markets likely gather sufficient resources engage production complex industrial products stimulate econom-ic prosperity . complex economy produces sophisticated diversified prod-ucts reflected productive structure , higher per capita income economy ( Hidalgo & Hausmann , 2009 ; Coşkun et al. , 2018 ; Neagu & Teodoru , 2019 ; Abassi et at. , 2021 ) . addition , developed countries , known produce highly specialized sophisticated manufactured products , ranked high in-dex economic complexity GDP per capita compared counterparts developing countries focus agricultural-related products less complex competitive .

United Nations Conference Trade Development ( UNCTAD , 1964 ) identified strong national insurance reinsurance markets major catalysts economic performance . basis , present study aims unearth impact insurance sector economic complexity . Thus , present study deviates previous literature focusing economic complexity better robust measure economic performance due emphasis product export diversifi-cation sophistication characterizes 21st-century economies.In addition , study provides fresh evidence analyzing whether different com-ponents insurance business , i.e. , non-life insurance life insurance , well total insurance , drive product/export diversity ubiquity OECD coun-tries . nexus insurance economic complexity topical unex-plored area finance literature . specifically , recent times , role insurance achieving economic prosperity front burner development dialogue thinking . Thus , important unravel influence insurance market determinant economic complexity . noted Zulfiqar et al .

Second , sample includes top 10 complex economies world reported Atlas Economic Complex-ity ( 2022 ) . Third , based World Bank income classification , countries selected classified high-income countries . OECD countries provide good ground explore role insurance market economic complexity.2 . Literature Review2.1 Conceptual FrameworkInsurance activity viewed separate form non-banking financial sector offers businesses people domestic savings risk management services . connection insurance economic complexity viewed three dimensions . include “ demand-following ” , “ supply-leading ” , “ feedback ” hypotheses ( Alhassan & Fiador , 2014 ) . “ demand-following ” hypothesis suggests economic complexity would increase demand insurance services . growing economic complexity would generate insurance demand due different elements risks associated innova-tion productive knowledge economic sophistication ( Romer , 1990 ; Robinson , 1952 ) . Yarri ( 1965 ) found people need life insurance leave money depend-ents well provide income retirement . “ supply-leading ” hypothesis , hand , contends robust insur-ance market offers means effectively transferring managing risk order spur economic expansion growth economic complexity ( Patrick , 1966 ) . insurance system lowers cost risk management risk diversification ensure efficient resource allocation production complex products . maximizing resource use , insurance market activity encourages investments , productivity economic sophistication ensuring efficient management pension risk di-versification . also means one-way causality running insurance economic growth . “ feedback ” hypothesis , third hypothesis , proposes two-way causal relationship insurance activity economic complexity . suggests well-developed insurance market spur economic complexity tech-nological changes , product services innovation ( Schumpeter , 1912 ) , stim-ulates demand insurance services ( Levine , 1997 ) , economic complexity 541Folorunsho M.

( 2012 ) , Lee et al . ( 2013 ) , Liu et al . ( 2016 ) concluded insurance sector beneficial impact economic growth Eurozone , developing nations G-7 countries , respectively . panel 20 emerging developed nations , Ul Din et al . ( 2017 ) employed three indica-tors insurance activity—written premiums , density , penetration—to analyze connection insurance economic growth . authors used fixed ef-fects model came conclusion life insurance significant posi-tive impact economic growth developing countries measured penetration , positive relationship life insurance economic growth developed countries measured written premiums density . According findings , non-life insurance beneficial impact economic growth developing nations across board three measures , whereas developed countries , true non-life measured density . Similarly , Mohyul Din et al . ( 2017 ) investigated topic six ( developing , developed , emerging ) nations 1980 2015 using panel auto-regres-sive distributed lagged ( PMG/ARDL ) methodology .
