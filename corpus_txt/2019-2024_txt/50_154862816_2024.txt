Introduction Every policymaker would love raise income per capita reducing inequality ensuring territory ’ environmental sustainability . Unfortunately , literature offers plentiful evidence foolhardy pursue objectives simultaneously . Trade-offs definitely arise national level . question , arise within country ’ individual regions ? environmental Kuznets curve ( EKC ) explains relation income level , income inequality environmental degradation ( Grunelwald et al. , 2017 ; Caviglia-Harris et al. , 2009 ; Acemoglu & Robinson , 2002 ; Heerink et al. , 2001 ) . Within framework , objective paper link literature EKC literature economic complexity ( Hausmann & Hidalgo , 2009 , 2011 ; Hausmann et al. , 2007 ; Hartman et al. , 2017 ) , income inequality ( Piketty & Saez , 2003 ) environmental sustainability ( Cristea et al. , 2013 ; Cherniwchan et al. , 2017 ; Copeland et al. , 2004 ) establish existence impossible trinity three desirable irreconcilable goals , keeping specifications Aizenman et al . ( 2013 ) . Thus contributions paper twofold : first , revisit ECK literature , focusing economic complexity ( EC ) indexes instead direct measures economic growth ; second , narrow analysis sub-national level within country ( Spain ) , considering new datasets international interregional flows goods . best knowledge , first paper cover ground . strong link promising literature EC economic growth countries regions long run . Hausmann & Hidalgo ( 2009 , 2011 , 2013 ) defined EC measure non-observable capabilities embedded production . Based concept revealed comparative advantage , complexity indicators capture diversification country ’ production ubiquity products country specializes . authors also provide evidence EC indicators perform well long-term determinants national economic growth . Typically , EC indexes estimated country level inter-national exports , little attention paid regions within countries inter-regional trade . Perez-Balsalobre et al . ( 2019 ) recently developed new dataset estimating EC indicators 50 Spanish provinces ( NUTS-3 ) period 1995–2016 . use international well intra-national flows , showing indicators outperform classical factors explaining 4 regional long-term growth . also establish EC indicators estimated Spanish provinces international trade flows higher obtained intra-national trade deliveries . outcome points products exported regions outside national borders generally complex traded domestically . related paper , Pérez-Balsalobre ( 2020 ) shows EC affected gravity regional level , products high complexity travel longer distances low complexity . regard greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions , use rich information developed context official Spanish Emissions Inventory System Ministry Ecological Transition . GHG emissions accounting system provides information NUTS-2 level territorial disaggregation , perfectly compatible exhaustive accounting whole country split sectors sources emissions . latter follows standard international methodology — reported IPCC EMEP / EEA Guides — estimate emissions type gas within sector economic activity . information available period 1990-2019 . inequality , lack homogenous indicators provincial level time . fill gap , derive novel dataset inequality indicators Spanish provinces period 2002–16 . Specifically , compute one widely applied metrics , Gini index ( Gini , 1912 ) , distribution before-tax after-tax personal income NUTS-3 level . samples personal income tax microdata provided Spanish Tax Administration Office . income database covers period 2002–16 46 provinces common tax territory . three pieces new datasets built , test presence trilemma . said , ultimate goal measure extent regions within countries face new impossible trinity : increasing EC indexes greater openness international trade ; 2 ) improving environmental quality reducing GHG emissions transport ; 3 ) increasing intra-national equality compensating uneven distribution income usually associated higher levels openness growth . starting body paper , explain use NUTS-3 spatial level analysis . analysis sought simply delve deeply available literature , beyond standard NUTS-2 level . topics considered ( e.g . territorial policy sustainability ) main political decisions taken European national level . Spain , however , highly 5 decentralized country , policies require collaboration administrations regional ( NUTS-2 ) even lower spatial level . bulk economic activity pollution centers main metropolitan areas , precisely NUTS-3 level captures best data . Moreover , Spain , EU countries , NUTS-3 level homogeneous spatial unit NUTS-2 , directly associated spatial level core-periphery structures arise . addition , current debate Spain “ España vaciada ” : , peripheral provinces come neglect precisely spatial unit reference usually NUTS-2 , scale certain territorial inequalities blurred . statistical effect mixing capital cities ( regional cores ) peripheral territories ( rural provinces ) region . Therefore , although main decisions cohesion , sustainability , competitiveness inequality taken European , national regional ( NUTS-2 ) level , rising awareness important consider lower spatial levels analysis whenever data allows . structure rest paper follows : Section 2 provides detailed background four literatures interconnected paper , defining expected relations variables mixed trilemma ; Section 3 4 explain construction datasets methodology , respectively ; Section 5 provides exploratory descriptive analysis temporal spatial dimension three indicators ; Section 6 provides results econometric analysis ; final section concludes . 2 . Background paper seeks interconnect four literatures : ) topics trilemma ; ii ) measurement economic complexity linked trade ; iii ) quantification income inequality within country regions ; iv ) quantification territory ’ environmental sustainability , focus emissions generated intra-national inter-national trade goods entering/leaving province . briefly , also review literature supporting method use test existence trilemma , relies open macroeconomics . literature analyzing link economic complexity income equality scarce . Hartman et al . ( 2017 ) recently published innovative paper relates EC inequality country level . analysis combines multivariate analysis , panel data econometrics 6 network analysis , finding countries complex exports enjoy lower levels income inequality exporting simpler products . results suggest economic complexity significant negative predictor income inequality . One possible mechanism produce result , suggest , involves quality institutions corresponding country . Complex industrial products usually require tacit knowledge distributed knowledge less complex products , based mainly factor endowments ( natural resources low labor costs ) . Increased tacit distributed knowledge incentivize workers unionize help negotiate high wages , thereby compressing wage inequality . results show economic complexity help explain given economy generates distributes income . also suggest country ’ productive structure may limit range income inequality . authors analyze 150 countries long period , 1963 2008 . paper sets baseline discussion , results derive analysis compresses wide variety countries , whose institutions vary considerably quality . limit , say , range complexity , quality institutions , focusing instead trade provinces given country ( Spain ) . quality institutions might critical , every province Spain must deal ( almost ) regulations distribution mechanisms , unions public transfers . Moreover , new homogenous setup , relationship complexity income inequality shift—as complex provinces associated richest productive provinces , income inequality within larger , less-developed regions . Furthermore , positive relationship found Hartman et al . ( 2017 ) vary also measured within country consequence two additional strong mechanisms : ) higher labour mobility within countries moderate income inequality within countries , since people vote feet , migrating less complex regions complex ones , following patterns predicted core-periphery model combining mobility goods , capital labour ( Fujita et al. , 2001 ) ; ii ) moreover , relationship observed countries diffuse within country , stronger mechanisms public transfer within country countries . regard , critical differentiate income inequality public intervention . said , literature complexity regional level scarce . One rare papers , Balland Rigby ( 2017 ) , offers analysis subnational EC indicators United States ( US ) . address allocation diffusion knowledge complexity US cities using 7 extensive patent database US Patent Trademark Office . city-tech knowledge network , found complexity unevenly distributed across cities . Similarly , Balland et al . ( 2019 ) develop framework identify systematically technological opportunities regions within EU . analysis based OECD-REGPAT database detect differences across technological sectors compute measures relatedness complexity . focuses patent applications period 1977–2011 regionalized NUTS-2 level inventor address EU-28 plus Iceland , Norway Switzerland . analysis corroborates intuition high-complexity regions also richest open regions , paying highest wages presenting greatest income inequalities . principle , highly complex products combine highly skilled labour , found predominantly richest regions , high salaries . Thus , despite positive relationship complexity income equality across countries ( Hartman et al. , 2017 ) , negative relationship exist within country . dynamics , also expect regions increase complexity introduce income inequalities . best knowledge , previous analysis linking economic complexity environmental quality , whether national regional level . However , literature tension economic growth GHG emissions abundant , great contributions recent years . specifically , given focus analysis trade dimension , revisit recent papers considering emissions linked international intra-national flows given country , large sample ( Alola , 2019 ; Wang et al. , 2019 ; Yang et al. , 2019 ; Cristea et al. , 2013 ) . Yang et al . ( 2019 ) analyze environmental implications inter-national inter-regional trade China , considering production consumption side issue , measuring potential effect emissions hypothetical no-trade scenario . paper manages isolate respective emissions burdens 30 regions country , production allocated flows provided within region : , hypothetical scenario inter-regional inter-national trade replaced local production-consumption . connection previous analysis , Cristea et al . ( 2013 ) study GHG emissions associated international trade , using origin-destination flows whole world . authors collect data transport mode use provide detailed comparisons output-associated GHG emissions GHG emissions international transport traded goods . According analysis , “ international transport responsible 33 % world-8 wide trade-related emissions 75 % emissions major manufacturing categories ” . goods internationally exported , approach allows compute separately emissions associated production emissions derived transportation . conclude inclusion transport radically modifies ranking countries emissions per dollar trade . go investigate whether including transport trade crucial decrease emissions , trade patterns may affect global transport emissions . However , limitation research consider domestic freight flows , represent large contribution economic activity countries . Somewhere two approaches , Llano et al . ( 2018 ) estimate database GHG emissions inter-regional freight flows Spanish regions . database considers origin-destination flows Spanish regions NUTS-3 level 1995 2015 , combining sector-specific flows four transport modes ( road , rail , ship aircraft ) corresponding GHG emissions factor mode , tons×km . dataset GHG emissions , generate analyze temporal , sectoral spatial pattern Spanish inter-regional GHG flows , discussing alternative scenarios period 2016–30 , suggesting emissions moderated promoting substitution highly polluting flows made road environmentally sustainable alternatives , like railway . previous findings suggest production highly complex products usually requires incorporation knowledge , sophisticated inputs value added ( high-tech intermediate goods business services ) . usually associated highly productive regions necessarily industries generate relatively high amounts pollution ( oil refining , mining , electric-power generation , etc. ) . Thus , regions smart combination qualified inputs high-tech industries achieve highest values complexity . regions , might hollowed-out dirtiest stages production-chains , swapped production imports parts components sourced regions countries . Typical examples Madrid Barcelona , gradually shifted heaviest industries outskirts surrounding provinces ( Toledo , Guadalajara , Tarragona , etc. ) . measure economic complexity limited regard , excludes emissions complexity production trade services , change relationship . trade ( freight movements ) relationship complexity emissions within country ’ provinces less clear . one hand , expect positive relation , since highly complex provinces associated high income economic growth . , positive relationship complexity high levels emissions gets fuzzy 9 soon consider transport mix typically used type delivery ( long vs. short distance ) . evidence products low complexity travel shortest distances . Two facts support : ) products low complexity highly ubiquitous require less-exclusive knowledge skill ; ii ) products low complexity associated less-productive , less-innovative less-internationalized firms , less likely survive country ’ core provinces . Conversely , highly complex products travel long distances reach farther more-competitive destinations ( within country abroad ) . Rail ship , moreover , cleanest transport modes , aircraft road dirtiest . Except dispatched aircraft , highly complex products end using low-pollution transport despite association long distances . Meanwhile , contribution interregional trade within country depend railway ’ share total transport . conditioned part geography ( size country , presence islands remote locations , orography altitude ) quality competing infrastructures available . Finally , show difficult prediction sign relationship , also helpful consider complex products associated modern types consumption logistics ( e-commerce , just-in-time , etc . ) , depend almost entirely fastest , most-polluting transport modes ( trucks aircraft ) . Given previous comments , expect find negative less clear relationship complexity environmental quality . negative relationship vary across regions geographical characteristics sectoral transport-mode specialization . terms evolution , also expect increasing level complexity expand region ’ share international trade relative intra-national trade . expansion boost emissions concentrates shortest distance ( Europe ) uses highly polluting transport-modes ( road ) . Finally , revisit literature nexus income equality environmental quality . Grunewald et al . ( 2017 ) investigate trade-off income inequality pollution emissions using larger panel 158 countries , longer time period ( 1980–2008 ) , previous investigations . Specifically , examine theoretically ambiguous link income inequality per-capita carbon dioxide emissions , find relationship depends level income . found negative relationship income inequality emissions low- middle-income economies . However , wealthier countries , inequality positively associated per-capita emissions . 10 Similarly , Hübler ( 2017 ) analyzes positive concave relationship households ’ attributed emissions income level , finding negative relationship emissions within-country inequality . test relationship , research uses simultaneous quantile regressions per-capita CO2 emissions dependent variable draws country-level panel data ( 150 countries period 1985–2012 ) . results vary across quantiles . Regressions pooled data support negative inequality-emissions link , fixed-effects estimations call question . paper also finds positive relationships ‘ international trade ’ ‘ international investments ’ emissions , something seems reasonable country level . judge previous paper , relationship income equality environmental quality either positive negative , depending different sub-samples provinces within country predominant sectoral specialization ( heavy industries vs. high-tech services ) . considerations , expect find empirical evidence existence equality-sustainability-complexity trilemma regional level . trilemma notion illustrated triangle ( Figure 1 ) . corners represent peak levels economic complexity , environmental quality income equality . Standing side triangle amounts fully achieving two three objectives ( two corners side ) . Hence , impossible achieve three aims fully . Inner points represent trilemma combinations policy goal neither fully reached neglected . Points closer corner side represent moves away others . words , trilemma constraint matter trade-offs trilemma goals . Figure 1 : Trilemma representation Economic complexity Environmental quality Income equality 11 Spain laboratory first empirical investigation , test verification trade-offs appear policymakers opt two three options . Methodologically , follow Aizenman et al . ( 2013 ) developed clever strategy detect impossible trinity . see next section , end considering ‘ quadrilemma specification ’ , indicators related complexity economic growth complement . 3 . Data state outset none three datasets needed empirical analysis described available Spain country context . countries collect detailed information sub-national level ( NUTS-3 ) estimate economic complexity ( requires detailed internal external trade ) , income equality ( requires personal income data region ) GHG emissions . therefore resort three novel powerful datasets either developed paper ( income inequality total GHG emissions ) published elsewhere . 3.1 . Complexity Index section relies Perez-Balsalobre et al . ( 2019 ) , developed new dataset estimating EC indicators 50 Spanish provinces ( NUTS-3 level ) 1 29-sector disaggregation period 1995–2016 , using international well intra-national flows . line previous research ( Reynolds et al. , 2017 ; Gao Zhou , 2018 ) , Perez-Balsalobre et al . ( 2019 ) provide methodology elaboration sub-national complexity indicators . However , study represents first attempt compute complexity index sub-national level considering international domestic trade dimensions . estimation process uses starting point product complexity index provided Atlas Economic Complexity ( 2013 ) , detailed product categories ( HS 6 digits ) country world . product complexity indexes determine level complexity product traded Spain , considering province-product specific flow 1 proximity provinces ( NUTS-3 ) real production locations makes best territorial representation economic complexity framework . Furthermore , size geographical characteristics makes comparable NUTS-2 regions . Additionally , NUTS-3 closest comparable spatial units urban areas , trade data available . 12 country every province within Spain . international trade flows data come official Border Custom database provide huge level product disaggregation . intra-national trade flows , use unique database domestic flows Spain allows us categorize domestic flows inter-regional intra-regional bilateral flows . database compiled processed using methodology explained Llano et al . ( 2010 ) published within framework C-intereg project ( www.c-intereg.es ) . database covers bilateral trade freight flows provincial level ( NUTS-3 ) breakdown 29 sectors four modes transport ( road , rail , ship plane ) . alternative equivalent database Spain . source intra-national flows data set official statistics collect origin-destination transport road ( Permanent Survey Road Transport Goods , Ministerio de Fomento ) , railway ( Complete Wagon Containers flows , RENFE ) , ship ( Spanish Ports Statistics , Puertos del Estado ) aircraft ( O/D Matrices Domestic Flows Goods Airport Origin Destination , AENA ) . addition , dataset removes hidden re-export structures domestic freight flows , avoiding double counting transit flows . 3.2 . Greenhouse gas emissions Spanish Emissions Inventory System Ministry Ecological Transition offers information GHG emissions NUTS-2 Spanish regions . database covers historical series 1990 2019 . GHG emissions data region disaggregation official emissions data national level , covers dimensions economy , including production goods services , transportation activities related movement goods people . According methodological note , official database treats individually emitting sources , size activity characterisation processes , relevant estimation priority pollutants . example , possible , emissions located geographically log-lat coordinates economic activity generates . “ bottom-up ” approach applicable information disaggregated spatial levels . contrast , activities issuers geographical information available , database uses “ top-down ” approach , territorial disaggregation best primary data available . 13 Taking official estimates given , main contribution downscale dataset NUTS-2 NUTS-3 , level rest analysis conducted . accomplish territorial disaggregation using regional GDPs , shown following equation : 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 ∗ �𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖� � ( 1 ) 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 refers GHG emissions province ( NUTS-3 ) year , 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 refers GHG emissions NUTS-2 region province belongs . 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 refer GDP corresponding province ( NUTS-3 ) region ( NUTS-2 ) year t. Note use GDP coherent top-down approach used original GHG dataset . 3.3 . Income Inequality Several variables traditionally used characterize measure economic inequality using individual databases . related income . common option household income per consumption unit . variable framed European Union Statistics Income Living Conditions dataset ( EU-SILC ) , therefore allows researchers get homogenous socioeconomic indicators within European countries regions . best case , depending country , spatial disaggregation within countries corresponds NUTS-2 regions . case Spain : lack sample representativeness NUTS-3 territorial level makes impossible compute provincial indicators source . overcome scarcity inequality metrics sub-national level , authors ( Piketty Saez , 2003 ; Atkinson , Piketty Saez , 2011 ; Onrubia Picos , 2013 ; Hortas-Rico Rios , 2019 ) used personal income tax data proxy inequality . Spanish Tax Administration Office ( Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria , AEAT ) Institute Fiscal Studies ( Instituto de Estudios Fiscales , IEF ) provide yearly sample microdata corresponding personal income tax returns individuals obligated declare.2 samples representative provincial level , covering period 2002–16 , large samples sizes ( 1 million 2002 2.7 million 2016 ) . Geographically , cover 46 provinces belonging common tax regime territory . Unfortunately , Comunidad Foral de Navarra País Vasco included study , tax regime provide access income tax data . 2 Muestra IRPF IEF-AEAT ( Declarantes ) Muestra IRPF IEF-AEAT ( Declarantes ) , years 2002 2016 . 14 Using income tax microdata several advantages . First , allows us compute homogeneous inequality indicators across time spatial sections.3 Second , richness microdata allows us compute income inequality indicators tax . apply Gini index ( Gini , 1912 ) , one popular measures income inequality . Specifically , compute before-tax Gini index total income received individuals , after-tax Gini index personal income tax , subsidies deductions ( e.g. , unemployment maternity benefits ) . differentiate before- after-tax income inequality , since public intervention generally leads lower after-tax indexes . However , redistribution policy applied equally common tax regime territory , autonomous communities comparatively little room manoeuvre , expect large correlation before- after-tax inequality measures within country framework . verify role indexes next sections focus mainly after-tax inequality index , since want account effect redistributive policy trilemma constraint . 4 . Methodology First , introduce trilemma indexes assess binding policy goals constrained analysed period . benchmark indicators normalized 0 1 minimum maximum values observed panel ( see minimum maximum values Table A1 , Appendix ) . indexes therefore interpreted relative values , higher values indicating greater achievement objective . 4.1 . Income Equality empirical strategy , income inequality measured Gini coefficient . relative normalized income equality index region year computed : 𝐼𝐼𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1 −𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺𝐼𝐼𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚 ( 2 ) IEit denotes income equality index province year , GINI Gini coefficient . equation , highest equality reached represented value 1 . 3 aware income tax inequality indicators may biased since involve individual incomes certain threshold , leaving bottom tail income distribution . partially avoid bias including sample individuals obligated declare , issue tax reports recover income tax withholdings . Despite potential bias , risks low given within-country context analysis well homogeneity methodology data source time regions . 15 4.2 . Environmental Quality index environmental quality based CO2 emissions per capita constructed follows : 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1 −𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂2 , 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂2 , 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂2 , 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂2 , 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚 ( 3 ) EQit denotes environmental quality index region year , 𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂2 , 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 refers per-capita emissions certain province year , 𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂2 , 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂2 , 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚 refer maximum minimum emissions per capita whole sample . Hence , region highest quality sample reach value 1 lowest province value 0 . 4.3 .

Table A1 Appendix summarizes main descriptive statistics indexes . 4.4 Validity trilemma indexes computed , time assess existence trade-offs among three policy goals . trilemma framework impose functional form expression relationships variables . Following Aizenman et al . ( 2013 ) , propose 16 linear hypothesis trilemma . verified , constraint rise one goals produce negative setback one two goals . Figure 1 , corresponds move one point another within triangle.4 Thus , simple linear equation test validity trilemma hypothesis . linear version implies weighted sum three policy variables adds constant , three coefficients positive . particular , trilemma propose links income equality , environmental quality economic complexity : 1 = 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗𝐼𝐼𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ( 6 ) j subscript refers different subsamples dataset partitioned time subperiods groups provinces . High goodness fit regression indicates linear specification explain trade-off among confronted variables . better fit regression equation , stronger support trade-off three dimensions . Additionally , estimated coefficients may read approximate estimates weights regions put different policy goals ( Aizenman et al. , 2013 ) . binding within traditional equality-sustainability-growth trilemma empirically verified within Spanish provinces well . Additionally , consider augmented equation adding economic complexity traditional trinity explore complexity ’ role . resulting quadrilemma equation ( Ainzenman et al. , 2013 ) : 1 = 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗𝐼𝐼𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗𝐸𝐸𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝐶𝐶𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ( 7 ) variable would relax trilemma coefficient negative significant . case , sum three traditional trilemma coefficients ( α + β + γ ) would greater quadrilemma equation trilemma equation . robustness check , following Canale et al .

Exploring trilemma indexes assessing existence trilemma complexity ’ role , let us explore relationships indexes across time groups regions . shake brevity , focus main relationships . best way illustrate leitmotif article analyze evolution indicators time .

Figure 2 : Time evolution main indicators : Income equality , Economic growth , Environmental quality , Economic complexity Figure 2 illustrates , economic complexity ( CI ) economic growth ( EG ) indexes evolve parallel , slight variations crisis ( 2008 ) clearer co-movement afterwards . Meanwhile , income equality indexes ( before- after-tax IE ) evolve similarly environmental quality ( EQ ) . Comparing variables time , 2008 crisis , observe asymmetric evolution pairs : EG CI versus IE EQ . Despite outlier IE 2006,5 minimum difference two groups observed 2007 , year real income reached maximum , preceding largest negative shock 5 Despite tax reforms introduced Spain period analyzed ( 2002 , 2006 2014 ) , previous analyses evolution income equality Spain reported fall 2006 . noted Onrubia Picos ( 2013 ) , Gini rose severely 2002 2006 economic boom , 2006 strong rise observed capital gains , Spanish Real Estate bubble burst 2007/2008 . effect fueled also announcement tax reform applied 2007 , would punish capital gains 21 January 2006 . 18 suffered Spanish economy since Spanish Civil War ( 1936–39 ) , current COVID-19 impact . also remarkable public sector ’ redistributive effect , measured difference before-tax after-tax IE , increased years 2008 shock : , public sector counteract private sector ’ drop activity high unemployment rates . trade-offs suggested time evolution indexes shown radar diamond charts plot average values indexes show variation time income group .

Conclusions Environmental Kuznets curve explains relation income level , income inequality environmental degradation , suggesting presence impossible trinity irreconcilable objectives three variables . main contribution paper revisit trilemma focusing economic complexity indexes instead direct measures economic growth , apply analysis sub-national level Spain . economic complexity indexes used based new datasets international intra-national trade , GHG emissions rooted official national regional statistics , generated international standardized methodology . also estimated new indexes income equality province level ( NUTS-3 ) , considering long period ( 2002–16 ) . descriptive analysis indexes obtained shows clear tension evolution two groups variables : economic growth complexity versus income equality environmental quality . econometric analysis verifies presence classic trilemma equality-sustainability-growth , also new version : equality-sustainability-complexity . complexity substitutes economic growth trilemma equation reinforces links . enrich analysis considering pre- post-crisis subsamples , estimating robustness checks three province income groups , using linear non-linear specifications . Furthermore , also tested presence quadrilemma , discussing role province ’ level complexity tends play aforementioned tensions growth , inequality sustainability . results promising open new avenues smart specialization regions within countries—specialization defined wider sense take account environmental social costs promoting growth focusing excessively internationalization region . 29 result especially relevant present , COVID-19 crisis putting globalization test , showing national sub-national boundary blink eye bring economic social interaction halt .
