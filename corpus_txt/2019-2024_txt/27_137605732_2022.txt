Phillimore et al. , 2020 ) , combinations “ old ” “ new ” diversities remain sorely under-researched social scientists andunder-addressed policymakers ( Vertovec , 2015 ) – part , complexityis literally difficult visualize.In article , argue visualizing urban superdiversity important twoways . First , social , cultural economic characteristics rapidly com-pound effects urban areas inhabited old new diversities , highlight needto understand urban contexts examining new combinations intersections mul-tiple variables – including variables neglected entirely new . Second , multivariate explorations require better ways “ complex thinking ” ( cf.Walby , 2021 ) , advocate developing innovative data visualization tools areequipped handle analyses multivariate data urban diversity , enabling awider range audiences picture apprehend abstract information aboutdifferent combinations social variables intuitive ways . sum , arguethat studies urban geographers migration researchers would benefit recon-ceptualizing diversity multidimensional ways , developing compelling new ways “ seeing ” multidimensional superdiversity available data . , believe , canhelp advance methods theories needed study unprecedented diversifica-tion occurring contemporary cities , underpin effective policies morecomprehensive public understanding urban superdiversity.To clear , though , believe approach represents important stepforward visualizing understanding contemporary diversity , claim tobe panacea .

Georg Simmel wrote “ stranger , ” example , 1908 ofhis ideas embraced Robert Park Chicago School urban sociology , enormous impact twentieth century understandings city . Theirarguments residential segregation – together over-simplified maps ofthe socio-cultural spaces Chicago , concentric parts city designated “ ghetto ” , “ Deutschland ” , “ Chinatown ” “ Little Sicily ” – became iconic . workset motion several abiding assumptions supposedly natural properincorporation immigrants , resulting residential order city : ethnicgroups coherent “ communities ” sharing range socio-cultural economictraits ; communities occupy relatively homogenous spaces “ immigrant colo-nies ” ( Burgess , 1925 , p. 56 ) ; residential location proxy socio-economic status ; assimilation inevitable , even natural , process.Twentieth-century urban studies therefore characterized maps cities thatreflect call “ ghetto thinking ” : idea segregation bounded andcoherent minority groups inherent urban condition deeply pervasivelyintertwined “ problem ” socio-economic deprivation ( Wirth , 1928 ; Peach,2003 , 2009 ; Collins , 2012 ) . Early efforts generate statistical indices segregationand economic marginalization products approach.This scholarly consensus reinforced challenged quantitative revo-lution brought digital analysis urban studies 1960s . time , itwas considered revolutionary researchers could acquire comprehensive data andfeed information mainframe computers generate maps statistics ; thiswas heralded new field study dubbed “ spatial science ” ( Billinge et al.,1984 ) . era also saw application multivariate statistics urban analysis andthe development factorial ecology model , involved subjecting largematrix socio-economic data factor-analytic approaches effort discern theunderlying structure urban social geography ( Berry , 1971 ) . Typically , within fac-torial ecology model , complex data distilled three core factors werebelieved shape residential order : ethnic difference ; socio-economic inequality ; family life cycle . Although later authors tradition acknowledged thethree-factor model insufficient , techniques produced nuanced modelsof cities previously possible ; nonetheless , problematic overall goal wasto “ cut ” complexity simplify ( Davies & Murdie , 1993 ) .Subsequently , Chicago School quantitative models urban geography werepanned various humanist , neo-Marxist , feminist , post-colonial scholars ( Plummer , 1997 ) . late twentieth century , urban geography sociologyfavored critical approaches stressing nature forms urban inequality ; URBAN GEOGRAPHY 3meanwhile , methods drifted quantitative qualitative . Post-modern urbantheorists pointed breakdown homogenous , concentric functional zonesmodelled Burgess others , highlighted emergence chaotic , multi-nodal urban structures ( Ellin , 1996 ; Dear & Flusty , 1998 ) . Significantly , thisoccurred social geography immigrant-destination cities profoundlytransformed new complex global migration flows ( Castles et al. , 2013 ) , gentrification ( see Lees et al. , 2013 ) , often influence neo-liberal pol-icies ( Pinson Journel , 2016 ) . Together , developments displaced whatever sal-ience Chicago School model inner-city ghettos assimilated suburbs mighthave – though perhaps fully scholarly circles public imagination.However , late twentieth early twenty-first centuries also seen re-emergence efforts offer new insights urban diversity . One key interventionhas concept intersectionality , developed within Black feminist scholar-ship emphasize mutually constitutive nature social categories , particularly race , class , gender ( see Hill Collins & Bilge , 2016 ) . Leslie McCall ( 2005 , p. 1772 ) , forexample , called extending insights intersectionality approaches “ thecomplexity arises subject analysis expands include multiple dimen-sions social life categories analysis. ” interests superdiversity aregrounded mode understanding : important recognize combinedeffects multiple variables producing socio-economic outcomes . , shareMcCall ’ ( 2001 ) concerns need better methods theories regardinghow new complexities , new combinations social variables , create ( ) produceforms multi-layered inequalities.The term superdiversity , coined Vertovec ( 2007 ) , refers increasingly multi-dimensional effects contemporary diversity . Rather fixating differences ofnationality ethnicity analysing diversity , draws attention variations '' language , religion well motives , patterns itineraries migration , processes insertion labour housing markets destinationcities '' ( Blommaert & Rampton , 2011 , p. 1 ) . Scholars work concept arethus interested disaggregating black boxes conventional social categories , posit-ing “ complexity ” new baseline social analysis ( Meissner et al. , 2015 ) . Whereas –following Chicago School perspective – places deemed “ multicultural ” per-ceived containing large spatial concentrations nominally homogenous minorityethno-religious groups , places considered superdiverse recognized containing mul-tidimensional kaleidoscopes smaller groupings , new old forms diver-sity interact form new configurations categories social difference along withnew challenges service providers ( Vertovec , 2015 ; Phillimore , 2010 ; Berg et al. , 2019 ) .Crucially , different phases understanding cities outlinedare associated different ways “ seeing ” urban life . Chicago School , andthe decades research inspired , saw inner cities patchwork quilts areas eachdominated particular , often immigrant , groups – processof ultimately achieving cultural assimilation economic affluence , even-tually moved “ upward outward ” leafy suburbs exemplified “ Americandream ” . Cities widely understood way also designed accordingly ( e.g . zoning regulations stipulated building densities ) . Quantitativemodels 1960s 1970s encouraged view urban complexity superficial4 S. VERTOVEC ET AL. “ noise ” , distracting scholars others impacts diversification . Cities , andtheir neighbourhoods , seen variations limited number themes . Ratherthan acknowledging grasping complexity urban contexts , views ofurban planners “ seemed premised ( and… sought impose ) homogeneityacross diverse urban field ” ( Fincher & Iveson , 2008 , p. 2 ) .Conversely , intersectionality superdiversity encourage us see urban complexityas : complexity . underscore complexity drawing several key notions incomplexity theory natural social sciences specifically : complexity ascharacterized phenomena increase number variables agentsin system ; increase differentiation characteristics ; increase interdepen-dencies among agents variables ; highly contingent , unpredictable non-linear emergence new systems effects ( cf . Jörg , 2011 ; Portugali et al. , 2012 ; Byrne & Callaghan , 2013 ) . Various forms stratification present factors associatedwith age , class relations , patriarchy , racialization , heteronormativity , legal differen-tiation – none single ordering principle urban life . Rather , urbansociety product forces – – operating simultaneously inter-actively , complexity amplified arrival migrants diverse sourcecountries regions , via varied legal extra-legal pathways.To fully grasp nature superdiversity , need new ways unpacking conven-tional social science categories new ways seeing complex evolving interactionsamong multiple forms social difference . address challenge , least part , ourcentral aim paper demonstrate new suite interactive data visualizationtools enable users conduct intersectional analyses multidimensional urbandatasets . demonstration draws innovatively compiled new datasets popu-lations three major immigrant-destination cities : Sydney , Vancouver , Auckland.These tools adapt update established quantitative methods analysing diver-sity , guided new nuanced conceptual understandings intersectionalityand superdiversity . , aim contribute new methodological andanalytical approach exploring nature significance urban superdiversity.Visualizing superdiversity various scalesThe methodological field multidimensional data visualization mushroomed overthe last quarter century . 1990s , greatly decreasing data storage costs expo-nentially increasingly network bandwidth already enabling construction ofenormous , fine-grained multidimensional datasets many companies governmentagencies . However , early 2000s , tools technologies reporting , analyz-ing , distributing , making decisions based data rudimentary ( Eick,2000 , p. 61 ) . number popular visualization methods enable presentationof two three variables ( dimensions ) time ; standard techniques included “ x-y ( -z ) plots , line graphs , bar column charts , area , staked bar columngraphs , histograms , pie charts , doughnut charts , box plots , radar graphs [ ] Paretographs ” ( Marghescu , 2007a ) . due dearth tools effectively displayingmore three variables simultaneously , much new bigger data remainedin raw relational tables required extensive training access , manipulate andreport . past 15 years , however , tools techniques multidimensionalURBAN GEOGRAPHY 5data visualization expanded improved significantly , driven need toanalyze new “ big data ” produced contemporaneous worldwide expansion hand-held internet devices , social media , processes algorithmic financial trading.By end 2000s , financial big-data researchers added range of4 + dimensional data visualization methods analytical toolkits , multipleline graphs , permutation matrices , survey plots , scatterplot matrices , parallel coordinates , treemaps , Sammon mapping , self-organizing maps , star-glyphs , dendrograms ( seereviews Marghescu , 2007a , 2007b ) . range users demanding insights frombig data expanded past decade fields wide-spread healthcare ana-lytics , energy provision , entertainment , accounting , paralegal marketing , fields ofdata science immersive data visualization become dynamic firmlyentrenched area research major research institutions around world ( Pezanowskiet al , 2022 ; Bergmann & Lally , 2021 ; Fernandez et al. , 2021 ) .Across number social science disciplines , growing literature demonstrates thepower new class multi-dimensional data visualization techniques conductinganalyses social difference ( see , instance , Dorling , 2012 ; Jung & Anderson , 2017 ; Healy , 2019 ) . However , surprising seldom analytical approaches beenapplied studyof intersectionality superdiversity , even though concepts expli-citly call multivariate analyses social difference . , address research gap , presenting variety data visualizations allow viewer “ see ” superdiversity byway different combinations variables significance . hope bringingtogether concepts , data , techniques visualization , encourage re-imaginationof complexity contemporary cities . visualizations depicted described belowcan accessed special website , interactive elements found ofthe three cities respective data ( https : //superdiv.mmg.mpg.de/ ) . website , viewer choose range variables , timeperiods andviews , also explore com-parative aspects superdiversity across cities.Our argument ( 1 ) many cities becoming superdiverse , ( 2 ) superdiversity amulti-dimensional concept ( 3 ) contemporary data visualization approaches helpus perceive , picture apprehend multiple dimensions . contribution thisarticle therefore methodological analytical rather empirical : examinesome specific multidimensional datasets urban superdiversity , inorder demonstrate potential new interactive data visualization toolsrather present specific new empirical findings data .
